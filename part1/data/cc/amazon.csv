"last week, california governor gavin newsom announced that he was intending to aggressively scale back plans for the state’s high-speed rail system, which in its most ambitious routing would have connected sacramento to san diego. the immediate cause was ballooning costs, which have risen from $33 billion to $77 billion and looked likely to exceed 1.6 zuckerbergs within a couple of years (the local ca currency, otherwise known as $100 billion). unlike other megaprojects, newsom — and california — were fortunate on the timing. the costs of the project skyrocketed so much and so early that newsom still had the credibility and political capital to kill the project. and while a short route from bakersfield to merced remains on the table, i don’t expect even that route to be ultimately constructed, since no one knows where either of those cities are. why can’t we (i.e. america) build anything? high-speed rail isn’t silicon valley whizbang magic technology, it’s definitely not hyperloop. it’s pretty standard in a bunch of industrialized nations around the world. clearly that question was on the minds of reporters, because we have been inundated with autopsies on hsr. yet, the hot takes don’t seem to be adding up to anything meaningful (surprise). so, we are going to explore this question over the coming weeks, as one of our newest obsessions here at extra crunch. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. this weekend, i read a book called “politics across the hudson: the tappan zee megaproject.” in the book, philip mark plotch chronicles the 40 years of planning that led to the reconstruction of the tappan zee bridge over the hudson river, which connects rockland and westchester counties north of new york city. if you want to read about the weeds of government dysfunction around infrastructure, this is your book. it’s a telling tale of patterns we see repeatedly when trying to build great things in the united states: no one wants to talk about finance: politicians love selling the value of a megaproject without actually discussing the ways they are going to have to pay for it. yet, paying for it is the project, since it will ultimately affect how citizens enjoy the infrastructure. in the tappan zee case, politicians wanted to avoid talking finances because finances meant tolls, and increasing tolls meant losing elections. new york’s current governor andrew cuomo ends up avoiding this conversation through luck, as the state received huge indemnities from wall street banks related to iranian money laundering and sanctions that helped fund the bridge (which one planner called “manna from god”).that avoidance has led to the “willie brown” model of infrastructure, named for the former san francisco mayor who wrote about how to get infrastructure projects done: news that the transbay terminal is something like $300 million over budget should not come as a shock to anyone. we always knew the initial estimate was way under the real cost. just like we never had a real cost for the central subway or the bay bridge or any other massive construction project. so get off it. in the world of civic projects, the first budget is really just a down payment. if people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. the idea is to get going. start digging a hole and make it so big, there’s no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in. of course, that model can lead to situations like boston’s big dig, where the final ticket price for a project is so high that it effectively bankrupts an entire city and its transportation system for years to come. infrastructure finance may not be a sexy topic, but it is absolutely critical to getting a project done. it’s hard to tuck tens of billions of dollars in a line item in the state’s budget, and it is hard to get the different funding levers of government involved when a project’s finances aren’t clear. lack of direction / lack of leadership: building infrastructure is hard. it’s even harder in the u.s., where a patchwork of regulatory bodies and all levels of government are involved in infrastructure decision-making. in the tappan zee bridge case, there were nearly two dozen agencies involved, all with their own agendas and fiefdoms. a dedicated bus lane on the bridge was cut to avoid bringing in the federal transit administration. the tappan zee is built at one of the widest points of the hudson river rather than the narrowest since planners wanted to avoid the jurisdiction of the port authority. here’s the thing though: there were real differences of opinion about the project and what it should accomplish. some people wanted a rail line, some wanted bus rapid transit, some wanted carpool lanes and still others wanted more lanes of vehicular traffic. nothing got done because there was absolutely no consensus either from the communities involved or from their elected leaders. one might call a 40-year planning process dysfunctional, but another view would say that this is exactly government working as intended. things don’t get built if there is no consensus, and that’s the value — and price — of democracy. the challenge though is that you can end up in these counter-veto game theoretic morasses (the book uses “wicked problems”), where no progress will truly ever get made because everyone has an incentive to block a project to get their vision included. here is where leadership makes such a difference. a leader in these contexts can find points of compromise, build coalitions, set agendas and a vision and create the momentum required to get these projects moving. unfortunately, finding leaders in american politics is excruciatingly difficult. impossibly high expectations / feature creep: every tech product manager knows the challenges of feature creep. another person swings by, and they have a choice feature they want added that is going to take time and resources, and has limited benefit to the rest of the user base of the product. unfortunately, infrastructure projects face many of the same challenges. when a megaproject looks like it has built up momentum, everyone tries to glom on to it, adding their pet project. what starts as a bridge replacement project soon morphs into a bridge replacement with a new 30-mile railroad, multiple train stations, a new bus rapid transit system and a complete zoning overhaul for multiple counties. yet, those extra “features” also add additional veto points and complications to the original project. they are effectively barnacles on the hull of an already slow-moving ship.big projects galvanize our imaginations, but they shrink under the weight of their own mass. better to downscale these projects into more bite-sized chunks with clear goals and deliverables rather than being all things to all people. one thing i was surprised reading about the tappan zee bridge is that the actual construction phase was relatively uneventful. the bridge was built mostly on time and on budget, mostly due to extreme attention from the ny governors’s office to not allow deviations (except to stop construction on july 4th so that construction wouldn’t mar riverfront bbqs). four years and billions of dollars to rebuild a bridge might be ridiculous, but so were the 36 years of planning that preceded the reconstruction. maybe that pattern isn’t true for every project, but the lesson of politics across the hudson is that once the government had a plan and timing on its side, it was (relatively) smooth-sailing to the finish line. lawyers! classen rafael / eyeem via getty images startups need attorneys to succeed, and today, extra crunch is pleased to start helping you find the most helpful ones in the industry. extra crunch managing editor eric eldon has published his deep-dive package into startup law and startup attorneys today. the package will include profiles of leading attorneys who have been identified by founders as the most helpful to their startups (today’s profile focuses on cynthia hess). we also have attorney daniel mckenzie writing about “how and why you should work with a startup lawyer.” finally, eric and his team created a comprehensive overview of all the legal issues that come with building a startup that they compiled into a handy a-to-z guide. our hope is that some of the thornier issues of building a startup can be made just a bit easier if you are armed with the right,

catch up to the company. according to the wall street journal, the vision fund’s two largest investors — the public investment fund of saudi arabia (pif) and abu dhabi’s mubadala investment company — are growing increasingly frustrated with the fund’s investment process, governance structure, and the exorbitant valuations and prices paid. apparently, dishing out billion dollar checks like halloween candy doesn’t make you popular with the people who give you those billions of dollars. this isn’t the first time we’ve heard angry whispers from vision fund investors, with previous reports suggesting softbank significantly pared down previous investments in wework and other portfolio companies after facing serious lp pushback on the check size. part of the lp concern over softbank’s laissez-faire attitude towards check writing comes down to issues of governance. as we’ve previously discussed in our attempts to unravel softbank’s beast of a corporate structure, softbank often invests in companies at the softbank holding company level before selling the ownership to the vision fund at a later date. in the follow-on transactions, the vision fund often ends up paying more — in some cases billions of dollars more — than the initial investment. now, lps are concerned that they’re getting fleeced for billions on the back end as softbank drives up those investment valuations. the ownership transfer process is just one aspect of the reportedly more general investor concerns around an opaque, complex, and disorganized investment process where softbank figurehead masayoshi son can overrule any investment decision with a “gladiatoresque thumbs-up, thumbs-down”. according to the wsj: concerns about valuation of the fund’s investments are closely linked to concerns about its investment process, in particular the power wielded by mr. son. in recent weeks, mr. son overruled objections from partners within softbank to a vision fund investment valued at as much as $1.5 billion into chehaoduo group, a chinese online car-trading platform, according to people familiar with the matter. chehaoduo was accused of fraud in recent weeks by a competitor. and as lps are growing concerned on how money is flowing out of the vision fund, softbank is also facing pressure from regulators on the money it is bringing in. while we’ve touched on softbank’s “love for leverage” before, credit agencies are once again expressing concern over the vision fund and softbank’s frothy debt levels, even noting that the company’s already junk-rated credit ratings have a better chance of getting downgraded further rather than improving. all this goes to say that while sexy headlines and frequent nine-figure-plus deals make it easy to think softbank has a blank check to dish out to any unicorn they please, the clock may be striking midnight for softbank as they face the reality of their enormous spending, which may not bode well for their hopes for a second vision fund. the overlooked element of the amazon hq2 battle written by arman tabatabai amazon’s decision last week to halt plans to bring a second headquarters to new york city’s long island city neighborhood brought passionate responses from two completely schools of thought. some celebrated the breakup as a defeat of unjust corporate tax breaks, subsidies, and gentrification, while others threw up their hands in outrage over the disappearance of tens of thousands of jobs and future economic value that an amazon presence would bring. while these two arguments have been beaten to death, the remaining half of amazon’s hq2 development in northern virginia highlights an aspect of the controversial process that often gets overlooked. over the weekend, the washington post highlighted how amazon’s pending arrival in crystal city has helped accelerate large infrastructure projects that have long been in limbo, including public transport expansions, roadway expansions, and the construction of a new bridge to the airport. on top of financial investments into these projects from amazon, the operational dates for the new hq2 creates a timeline and has forced urgency to actually finalize plans and get these projects completed. a huge but often overlooked political benefit of amazon’s hq2 process is this ability to catalyze action around public projects that otherwise may face the purgatory of public infrastructure development. while many have criticized amazon for its auction-style selection process, many mayors and representatives from other cities that participated in the hq2 process actually viewed the process in a positive light because they were able to unlock economic value and incentives for the city that would have been much tougher to realize otherwise. obsessions more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure, and “why can’t we build things” we are going to be talking india here, focused around the book “billionaire raj” by james

"this is the year when the money spent on digital advertising will finally overtake spending on traditional ads — at least according to the latest forecast from emarketer. the research firm is predicting that u.s. digital ad spend will increase 19.1 percent this year, to $129.3 billion, while traditional advertising will fall 19 percent, to $109.5 billion. that means digital will account for 54.2 percent of the total, while traditional will only represent 45.8 percent. not surprisingly, most of the digital ad money is going to google and facebook . however, emarketer says google’s share of the market will actually decline, from 38.2 percent last year to 37.2 percent this year, and facebook’s share will only grow slightly, from 21.8 percent to 22.1 percent. apparently, amazon is the main beneficiary here, with its u.s. ad business set to expand by more than 50 percent, accounting for 8.8 percent of total spend. “the [amazon] platform is rich with shoppers’ behavioral data for targeting and provides access to purchase data in real-time,” said emarketer forecasting director monica peart in a statement. “this type of access was once only available through the retail partner, to share at their discretion. but with amazon’s suite of sponsored ads, marketers have unprecedented access to the ‘shelves’ where consumers are shopping.” the firm also forecasts that by 2023, digital will account for more than two-thirds of total ad spending. digital ad spending grew to $49.5b in the first half of 2018, according to iab"
"patricia nakache contributor patricia nakache is a general partner at trinity ventures. more posts by this contributor defensible strategies for food tech entrepreneurs facing the amazon juggernaut how startups are making real estate businesses more efficient john lin contributor john lin is an associate partner at trinity ventures supporting investments in developer tools, artificial intelligence and real estate. from entertainment to transportation, technology has upended nearly every major industry — with one notable exception: real estate. instead of disrupting the sector, the last generation of real estate technology companies primarily improved efficiencies of existing processes. industry leaders zillow/trulia and loopnet* helped us search for homes and commercial real estate better and faster, but they didn’t significantly change what we buy or lease or from whom or how. the next generation of real estate technology companies is taking a more expansive approach, dismantling existing systems and reimagining entirely new ones that address our growing demand for affordability, community and flexibility. the increasing need for affordability home ownership has long been integral to the american dream, but for many young americans today it’s an unattainable dream. a third of millennials live at home, and as a cohort, they spend a greater share of their income on rent than previous generations did — about 45 percent during their first decade of work. this leaves little money left over for savings, much less for home ownership, the largest financial expenditure of most people’s lifetimes. the increasing need for affordable housing is driving some creative tech-enabled solutions. one segment of startups is focused on making existing homes more affordable, especially in high-cost markets like new york and the bay area. divvy helps consumers, many of them with low credit scores, rent-to-own homes, which are assessed for viability by a combination of contractors and machine learning. landed, funded by the chan zuckerberg initiative, helps educators afford homes in the communities in which they teach. homeshare divides luxury apartments into multiple more-affordable units, and bungalow takes a similar approach with houses. both companies have built technology platforms to manage their tenant listings and to allocate tenant expenses and streamline payments. consumers aren’t just craving affordability, they’re also seeking company. another segment of startups is aiming to reduce the costs of building new homes, such as with modular, prefab housing to reduce construction costs. katerra, which just raised $865 million, is aiming to create a seamless, one-stop shop for commercial and residential development, managing the entire building process from design and sourcing through the completion of construction. taking a “full stack” approach to every step of the building process should enable them to find efficiencies and reduce costs. if the economy weakens, the need for more affordable housing will only grow, making these startups not only recession-proof but even recession-strong. collectively, they’re helping americans right-size their dreams to something more broadly attainable. in search of community consumers aren’t just craving affordability, they’re also seeking company. more than half of americans feel lonely, and the youngest cohort in their late teens and early-to-mid-twenties are the loneliest of the bunch (followed closely by millennials). millennials are the first generation to enter the workforce in the era of smartphones and laptops. while 24/7 connectivity enables us to work anywhere, anytime, it also creates expectations of working anywhere, anytime — and so many people do, bleeding the lines between work life and personal life. longer work hours make community harder to build organically, so many millennials place value on employers and landlords who facilitate it for them. airbnb and wework were early to capitalize on the demand for community, with one changing how we travel and the other redefining the modern office space. co-working companies like wework, as well more targeted providers like the assembly*, the wing and the riveter, offer speaker series, classes and other free member events aimed at building connections. airbnb, once focused only on lodging, has broadened its platform to include community-building shared experiences. shared living and hospitality startups are also investing in community to attract and retain customers. starcity provides dorms for adults, common and hubhaus rent homes intended to be shared by roommates and ollie offers luxury micro apartments in a co-living environment. these companies are leveraging technology to foster in-person connections. for example, common uses slack channels to communicate with and connect members, and hubhaus uses roommate matching algorithms. within the hospitality sector, selina offers a blended travel lodge, wellness and co-working platform geared toward creating community for travelers and remote workers, complete with high-tech beachside and jungle-side office spaces. meanwhile, experience-driven lifestyle hotel company life house* connects guests through onsite locally rooted food and beverage destinations and direct app-based social introductions to other travelers. modern life requires flexibility life can be unpredictable, especially for young people who tend to change jobs frequently. short job tenures are especially common within the growing gig economy workforce. people who don’t know how long their jobs will last don’t want to be burdened with long-term lease commitments or furniture that’s nearly as expensive to move as it is to buy. the next frontier in real estate technology is as boundless as it is exciting. companies like feather, fernish and casaone rent furniture to people seeking flexibility in their living environments. among consumers ready to buy their homes but looking for some extra help, knock, created by trulia founding team members and which recently raised a $400 million series b, provides an end-to-end platform to enable home buyers to buy a new home before selling their old one. also emphasizing flexibility, opendoor, valued at more than $2 billion, pioneered “instant offers” for homeowners looking to sell their homes quickly, leveraging algorithms to determine how much specific houses are worth. it’s not just residents who seek flexible leases; many companies do as well, particularly those accommodating distributed employees or experiencing periods of uncertainty or rapid growth. to enable flexibility, several commercial real estate technology companies have developed platforms that balance pricing, capacity and demand. knotel, a “headquarters as a service” for companies with 100-300 employees, builds out and manages office spaces at lower risk and with more flexibility than is typically possible through commercial real estate leases, enabling tenants to quickly add or shrink office space as needed. wework allows members to pay only for the time periods when they come in to work. taking flexibility to an even greater level, breather lets workers rent rooms by the hour, day or month. the next frontier in real estate technology is as boundless as it is exciting. a whole new generation of startups is designing innovative solutions from the ground up to address our growing demands for affordability, community and flexibility. in the process, they’re fundamentally reimagining how we live, work and play by transforming the modern workplace, leisure space and even our definition of home. we look forward to seeing — and experiencing — what lies ahead. *trinity ventures portfolio company."
"amazon will stop forbidding third-party merchants who list on its e-commerce platform in the united states from selling the same products on other sites for lower prices, reports axios. the company’s decision to end its price parity provision comes three months after sen. richard blumenthal urged the department of justice to open an antitrust investigation into amazon’s policies and a few days after democratic presidential candidate sen. elizabeth warren announced she would make breaking up amazon, google and facebook a big part of her campaign platform. also called “most favored nation” (mfn) requirements, amazon’s price parity provisions gave it a competitive edge, but because of its size, also led to concerns about its impact on competition and fair pricing for consumers. amazon stopped requiring price parity of its european union sellers in 2013 after it was the subject of investigations by the united kingdom’s office of fair trading and germany’s federal cartel office. in a statement, blumenthal said amazon’s “wise and welcome decision comes only after aggressive advocacy and attention that compelled amazon to abandon its abusive contract clause.” he added that “i remain deeply troubled that federal regulators responsible for cracking down on anti-competitive practices seem asleep at the wheel, at great cost to american innovation and consumers.” techcrunch has contacted amazon for comment."
"amazon this morning announced a new initiative focused on reducing counterfeiting on its site called project zero — a name that references amazon’s lofty goal of driving counterfeit sales to zero. the program will take advantage of amazon’s technology, including machine learning capabilities, combined with brands’ own knowledge of their intellectual property, in order to automatically and continuously scan amazon’s store to identify and proactively remove violations, among other things. brands that want to utilize the new tools will provide amazon with their logos, trademarks and other key data about their brand. amazon will then scan its 5 billion product listing updates per day, looking for any suspected counterfeits, it says. the idea here is to put more technology behind the search for counterfeits, in order to become more proactive instead of reactive. in the past, brands would need to file a counterfeit report with amazon in order to take action. the new tools allow brands to directly remove and control listings from amazon’s store without having to first contact amazon. another optional service involved with the larger project zero program is product serialization. this service will allow amazon to scan to confirm the authenticity of every one of a brand’s products purchased on the site. it provides a unique code for each manufactured unit, which are put on products during the manufacturing process. when the product is later ordered, amazon scans this code to verify the purchase is authentic. if it’s not, amazon can detect and stop a counterfeit item before it reaches the customer. while project zero enrollment itself is free, brands that use the product serialization service will incur a cost between $0.01 and $0.05 per unit, based on volume, amazon notes. counterfeiting has become a serious problem on amazon, largely due to the size and scale of amazon’s third-party marketplace, which it does little to regulate. some of these items are never even touched by amazon, but are sold and shipped by the third-party seller themselves. others are only fulfilled by amazon, but that doesn’t include a verification process. however, those will bear a “fulfilled by amazon” label, which some consumers misunderstand to mean they’re trustworthy because amazon is somehow involved. according to a study by advocacy group the counterfeit report last year, there have been around 58,000 counterfeit products on amazon since may 2016, engadget reported. but the total number of fakes is much higher, because tcr only accounted for the brands it represents. amazon has been repeatedly called out by brands for effectively being “complicit” with the counterfeiting business, always dusting aside issues because they involved third-party sellers, not amazon’s own store. this has also allowed amazon to escape many legal issues around counterfeiting, though it continues to face lawsuits. for instance, daimler ag sued amazon in 2016 for profiting from sales of wheels that violated its patents. that same year, a family sued amazon when a counterfeit hoverboard burned down their house. apple also sued mobile star llc for making counterfeit apple chargers, which it tried to pass off as authentic on amazon, which brought the retailer’s name to the news. more recently, amazon has inserted itself into the legal battles. last year, it filed three lawsuits in partnership with fashion designer vera bradley and mobile accessories maker otterbox over counterfeits. counterfeiting is not only detrimental to consumers and the brands being copied, it impacts amazon’s business directly — particularly in the increasingly important fashion category. many fashion brands won’t work with amazon. birkenstock, for example, decided to stop doing business with amazon. lvmh (celine, dior, givenchy, louis vuitton and others) said last year that the business of amazon “does not fit” with its brands, and swatch backed out of a deal to sell on amazon in 2017 when the retailer refused to implement proactive protections against counterfeiters. despite all these issues, recent pressure from the u.s. government may have been what helped turn the tide here — forcing amazon and others in the industry to take counterfeiting more seriously. last year, federal investigators purchased counterfeit products off the biggest and most well-known e-commerce sites, including amazon, walmart, ebay, newegg and sears marketplace. of 47 products, 20 were counterfeit — including urban decay cosmetics, yeti mugs, nike air jordan shoes, phone chargers and more. the e-commerce companies, naturally, expressed righteous condemnation of counterfeiting and pledged to work with policy makers on resolutions. amazon says its new project zero tools have been in testing with several brands before today’s launch, including the above-mentioned vera bradley; pet anxiety products manufacturer thunderworks; mobile accessories maker kenu; and lint remover manufacturer chom chom roller. during the testing period, amazon claims it was able to proactively stop 100 times more suspected counterfeit products, compared to what it reactively removes based on brands’ reports. “project zero, with its automated protections and the self-service removal of counterfeit products, is a significant development that will help ensure our customers receive authentic vera bradley products from amazon,” said mark dely, chief legal and administrator officer at vera bradley. “amazon’s product serialization service has been a game-changer for us. we are excited to have this self-service counterfeit removal tool for the u.s. marketplace and consider this to be an insurance policy,” said ken minn, ceo, kenu. project zero is placing a lot of trust in the brands submitting the claims, so amazon warns it will monitor usage for accuracy of their reports. “we are providing brands with an unprecedented level of responsibility, and we are willing to do so because we believe that the combined strengths of amazon and brands can drive counterfeits to zero,” the company writes on the project zero website faq. “brands must maintain a high bar for accuracy in order to maintain their project zero privileges. we have a number of processes in place to promote accuracy, including required training as part of project zero enrollment and ongoing monitoring to prevent misuse of our tools.”  project zero is launching first as an invite-only product in the u.s.; brands can sign up to join before rolling out more broadly. participants must have a government-registered trademark and be enrolled in the amazon brand registry to qualify."
"maybe you won’t need a glitter bomb to protect your amazon packages from porch thieves after all. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, canadian appliance maker danby is showing off its newly launched smart mailbox called parcel guard, which allows deliveries to be left securely at customers’ doorsteps. the box offers both a drop-in slot for smaller items, as well as a safe with a separate door for larger items. when packages are left, you’re alerted to their arrival by way of a push notification from the parcel guard app. it’s worth noting that parcel guard doesn’t require the delivery driver to adjust their routine. and it looks very obviously like a mailbox – right down to its little red flag on the side. there’s not much confusion about what it’s for. however, the box will also come with an informational sticker you can place on the front that instructs drivers to drop packages here instead of leaving them by the door. the mailbox’s anti-theft drop-in slot is like those found on usps mailboxes. once the package goes in, there’s no way to reach in and pull it back out. for large (or fragile) items that need to be placed inside the box instead of dropped, the driver simply scans the package which triggers the safe door to unlock. when the door is shut, the parcel guard locks and you’re alerted. the box also includes wireless connectivity, a motion-activated ip camera (so you can see the delivery in action), a tamper alarm, and a weight monitor. for additional security, you can opt to bolt the mailbox to the wall or the ground. there’s even a false bottom in the box – in case you want to secure it from being easily moved by placing something like a bag of sand under the bottom cover instead. while protecting against package theft is parcel guard’s primary purpose, it can also be used for other purposes – like if friend or neighbor needs to drop something off at your home, for example, or even just to protect packages from bad weather. to retrieve your packages, you unlock the box with the app. the mailbox is made of industrial grade plastic, and includes a battery backup in the event of a power outage. but it’s not small – at 19.7″ x 15.9″ x 39.4″, it’s designed for people whose houses have entryways or larger doorsteps, not for those who live in apartments. parcel guard is not the only device that’s trying to tackle the problem with package theft – there’s also a smart padlock called boxlock doing the same, as well as a similar product called inbin. but the latter is designed to look more like a planter than a mailbox. plus, there are services that work with existing devices to allow entry into the home, like amazon key. the parcel guard smart mailbox will be available for pre-order on danby’s website for $399 starting this week."
"the federal trade commission announced on tuesday evening that it has brought its first case against using fake reviews to sell products online. the commission said it will settle with defendant cure encapsulations inc., a new york city-based company, and owner naftula jacobwitz, who it accused of making false claims about a weight loss supplement and paying a third-party website to post fake reviews on amazon. fake reviews are a constant nuisance for amazon shoppers, despite algorithms designed to safeguard its review system, and the company has hit back with a series of lawsuits against websites that offer to post fake verified reviews. according to the ftc’s complaint, cure encapsulations sold pills with garcinia cambogia, a tropical fruit also called brindleberry that is sometimes used as a “natural” weight loss aid. called quality encapsulations garcinia cambogia, the pills were sold only on amazon. jacobwitz paid a website called www.amazonverifiedreviews.com to post favorable reviews in order to boost its rating (chris embry, operator of amazonverifiedreviews.com, was one of the defendants named in a lawsuit filed by amazon in 2016). an exhibit from the ftc’s complaint against cure encapsulations inc. on october 8, 2014, jacobwitz sent an email to the site’s operator saying he’d pay a total of $1,000 for 30 reviews, three per day, with the goal of increasing its 4.2 rating to 4.3, which he claimed was necessary in order to have sales. he also wrote that he wanted the product to “stay a five star.” www.amazonverifiedreviews.com then posted a series of fake five-star reviews praising the pills. the ftc said the reviews made false claims, including that the pills were a powerful appetite suppressant, caused weight loss of up to 20 pounds and blocked the formation of new fat cells. the proposed settlement includes a judgement of $12.8 million, to be suspended upon payment of $50,000 to the ftc and certain unpaid income tax obligations. the settlement also bans cure encapsulations and jacobwitz from making weight-loss, fat-blocking or disease-treatment claims for dietary supplements, food or drugs, unless they have reliable scientific evidence from clinical trials in humans. they are also prohibited from making misrepresentations about endorsements, including fake reviews, and must tell amazon which reviews were faked and email customers who have bought the pills to give them information about ftc’s allegations. in a press release, andrew smith, director of the ftc’s bureau of consumer protection, said, “when a company buys fake reviews to inflate its amazon ratings, it hurts both shoppers and companies that play by the rules.” in a media statement, a amazon spokesperson said, “we welcome the ftc’s work in this area. amazon invests significant resources to protect the integrity of reviews in our store because we know customers value the insights and experiences shared by fellow shoppers. even one inauthentic review is one too many. we have clear participation guidelines for both reviewers and selling partners and we suspend, ban, and take legal action on those who violate our policies.”"
"amazon has reportedly acquired israeli disaster recovery startup cloudendure. neither company has responded to our request for confirmation, but we have heard from multiple sources that the deal has happened. while some outlets have been reporting the deal was worth $250 million, we are hearing it’s closer to $200 million. note: after we published, cloudendure confirmed on its website, that it has been acquired by aws. the company provides disaster recovery for cloud customers. you may be thinking that disaster recovery is precisely why we put our trust in cloud vendors. if something goes wrong, it’s the vendor’s problem — and you would be right to make this assumption, but nothing is simple. if you have a hybrid or multi-cloud scenario, you need to have ways to recover your data in the event of a disaster like weather, a cyberattack or political issue. that’s where a company like cloudendure comes into play. it can help you recover and get back and running in another place, no matter where your data lives, by providing a continuous backup and migration between clouds and private data centers. while cloudendure currently works with aws, azure and google cloud platform, it’s not clear if amazon would continue to support these other vendors. the company was backed by dell technologies capital, infosys and magma venture partners, among others. ray wang, founder and principal analyst at constellation research, says infosys recently divested its part of the deal and that might have precipitated the sale. “so much information is sitting in the cloud that you need backups and regions to make sure you have seamless recovery in the event of a disaster,” wang told techcrunch. while he isn’t clear what amazon will do with the company, he says it will test just how open it is. “if you have multi-cloud and want your on-prem data backed up, or if you have backup on one cloud like aws and want it on google or azure, you could do this today with cloudendure,” he said. “that’s why i’m curious if they’ll keep supporting azure or gcp,” he added. cloudendure was founded in 2012 and has raised just over $18 million. its most recent investment came in 2016 when it raised $6 million, led by infosys and magma."
"you might not think of self-driving technologies and politics having much in common, but at least in one way, they overlap meaningfully: yesterday’s enemy can be tomorrow’s ally. such was the message we gleaned thursday night at a strictlyvc event in san francisco, where we had the chance to sit down with chris urmson, the co-founder and ceo of aurora, a company that (among many others) is endeavoring to make self-driving technologies a safer and more widely adopted alternative to human drivers. it was a big day for urmson. that morning, his two-year-old company announced a whopping $530 million in series b funding, a round that was led by top firm sequoia capital and that included “significant investment” from t. rowe price and amazon. the financing for aurora — which is building what it calls a “driver” technology that it expects to eventually integrate into cars built by volkswagen, hyundai and china’s byton, among others — is highly notable, even in a sea of giant fundings. not only does it represent sequoia’s biggest bet yet on any kind of self-driving technology, it’s also an “incredible endorsement” from t. rowe price, said urmson thursday night, suggesting it demonstrates that the money management giant “thinks long term and strategically [that] we’re the independent option to self-driving cars.” even more telling, perhaps, is the participation of amazon, which is in constant competition to be the world’s most valuable company, and whose involvement could lead to a variety of scenarios down the road, from aurora powering delivery fleets overseen by amazon, to amazon acquiring aurora outright. amazon has already begun marketing more aggressively to global car companies and tier 1 suppliers that are focused on building connected products, saying its aws platform can help them speed their pace of innovation and lower their cost structures. in november, it also debuted a global, autonomous racing league for 1/18th scale, radio-controlled, self-driving four-wheeled race cars that are designed to help developers learn about reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning. imagine what it could learn from aurora. indeed, at the event, urmson said that as aurora had “constructed our funding round, [we were] very much thinking strategically about how to be successful in our mission of building a driver. and one thing that a driver can do is move people, but it can also move goods. and it’s harder to think of a company where moving goods is more important than amazon.” added urmson, “having the opportunity to have them partner with us in this funding round, and [talk about] what we might build in the future is awesome.” (aurora’s site also now features language about “transforming the way people and goods move.”) the interest of amazon, t. rowe, sequoia and aurora’s other backers isn’t surprising. urmson was the formal technical lead of google’s self-driving car program (now waymo) . one of his co-founders, drew bagnell, is a machine learning expert who still teaches at carnegie mellon and was formerly the head of uber’s autonomy and perception team. aurora’s third co-founder is sterling anderson, who led tesla’s autopilot team. aurora’s big round seemingly spooked tesla investors, in fact, with shares in the electric car maker dropping as media outlets reported on the details. the development seems like just the type of possibility that had tesla ceo elon musk unsettled when aurora got off the ground a couple of years ago and tesla immediately filed a lawsuit against it, accusing urmson and anderson of trying to poach at least a dozen tesla engineers and accusing anderson of taking confidential information and destroying the  evidence “in an effort to cover his tracks.” that suit was dropped two and a half weeks later in a settlement that saw aurora pay $100,000. anderson said at the time the amount was meant to cover the cost of an independent auditor to scour aurora’s systems for confidential tesla information. urmson reiterated on thursday night that it was purely an “economic decision” meant to keep aurora from getting further embroiled in an expensive spat. but urmson, who has previously called the lawsuit “classy,” didn’t take the bait on thursday when asked about musk, including whether he has talked in the last two years with musk (no), and whether aurora might need tesla in the future (possibly). instead of lording aurora’s momentum over the company, urmson said that aurora and tesla “got off on the wrong foot.” laughing a bit, he went on to lavish some praise on the self-driving technology that lives inside tesla cars, adding that “if there’s an opportunity to work with them in the future, that’d be great.” aurora, which is also competing now against the likes of uber, also sees uber as a potential partner down the line, said urmson. asked about the company’s costly self-driving efforts, whose scale has been drastically downsized in the 11 months since one of its vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in arizona, urmson noted simply that aurora is “in the business of delivering the driver, and uber needs a lot of drivers, so we think it would be wonderful to partner with them, to partner with lyft, to partner [with companies with similar ambitions] globally. we see those companies as partners in the future.” he added, when asked for more specifics, that there’s “nothing to talk about right now.” before thursday’s event, aurora had sent us some more detailed information about the four divisions that currently employ the 200 people that make up the company, a number that will obviously expand with its new round, as will the testing it’s doing, both on california roads and in pittsburgh, where it also has a sizable presence. we didn’t have a chance to run them during our conversation with urmson, but we thought they were interesting and that you might think so, too. below, for example, is the “hub” of the aurora driver. this is the computer system that powers, coordinates and fuses signals from all of the vehicle’s sensors, executes the software and controls the vehicle. aurora says it’s designing the aurora driver to seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of vehicle platforms from different makes, models and classes. and here is a visual representation of aurora’s perception system, which the company says is able to understand complex urban environments where vehicles need to safely navigate amid many moving objects, including bikes, scooters, pedestrians and cars. it didn’t imagine it would at the outset, but aurora is also building its own mapping system to ensure what it (unsurprisingly) calls the highest level of precision and scalability, so vehicles powered by the company can understand where they are and update the maps as the world changes. we asked urmson if, when the tech is finally ready to go into cars, aurora will white-label the technology or else its customers will use aurora’s brand as a selling point. he said the matter hasn’t been decided yet but seemed to suggest that aurora is leaning in the latter direction. he also said the technology would be installed on the carmakers’ factory floors (with aurora’s help). one of the ways that aurora says it’s able to efficiently develop a robust “driver” is to build its own simulation system. it uses its simulator to test its software with different scenarios that vehicles encounter on the road, which it says enables repeatable testing that’s impossible to achieve by just driving more miles. you can see a seemingly see a merger happening in the graphic. aurora’s motion planning team works closely with the perception team to create a system that both detects the important objects on and around the road, and tries to accurately predict how they will move in the future. the ability to capture, understand and predict the motion of other objects is critical if the tech is going to navigate real-world scenarios in dense urban environments, and urmson has said in the past that aurora’s workflow in this area is superior to competitors that send the technology back and forth between teams. specifically, he told the atlantic last year: “the classic way you engineer a system like this is that you have a team working on perception. they go out and make it as good as they can, and they get to a plateau and hand it off to the motion-planning people. and they write the thing that figures out where to stop or how to change a lane, and it deals with all the noise that’s in the perception system because it’s not seeing the world perfectly. it has errors. maybe it thinks it’s moving a little faster or slower than it is. maybe every once in a while it generates a false positive. the motion-planning system has to respond to that. “so the motion-planning people are lagging behind the perception people, but they get it all dialed in and it’s working well enough — as well as it can with that level of perception — and then the perception people say, ‘oh, but we’ve got a new push [of code].’ then the motion-planning people are behind the eight ball again, and their system is breaking when it shouldn’t.” we also asked urmson about google, whose self-driving unit was renamed waymo as it spun out from the alphabet umbrella as its own company. he was highly diplomatic, saying only good things about his former employer and, when asked if the company ever challenged him on anything since leaving (as tesla had challenged anderson), he said it had not. still, he told us one of the biggest advantages that aurora enjoys is that it was able to use the learnings of its three founders and to start from scratch, whereas big companies cannot. as he also told techcrunch in a separate interview last year, when it comes to creating effective self-driving tech, size matters less than one might imagine. “there’s this really easy metric that everyone is using, which is number of miles driven, and it’s one of those things that was really convenient for me in my old place [google] because we’re out there and we were doing a hell of a lot more than anybody else was at the time, and so it was an easy number to talk about. what’s lost in that, though, is it’s not really the volume of the miles that you drive.” it’s about the quality of the data, he’d continued, suggesting that, for now, at least, aurora’s is hard to beat."

"rivian, the electric automaker that debuted its first two vehicles just three months ago, has raised $700 million in a round led by amazon . the news follows a report earlier this week by reuters that gm and amazon were in talks to invest in the electric vehicle company. “we’re inspired by rivian’s vision for the future of electric transportation,” amazon ceo worldwide consumer jeff wilke said in a statement. “rj has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. we’re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.” rivian says it will remain an independent company. the equity round also includes participation from existing shareholders. alj is the company’s primary investor. rivian and amazon are not disclosing additional details about this investment. rivian is a curious company that has spent the majority of its life in the shadows. founder and ceo rj scaringe launched it as mainstream motors in 2009. by 2011, the name changed to rivian and moved out of florida. today, the company has more than 750 employees split between four development locations in the u.s. and an office in the u.k. the bulk of its employees are in michigan to be close to an expansive automotive supply chain. the company also has operations in san jose and irvine, calif., where engineers are working on autonomous vehicle technology. rivian purchased in 2017 the normal, ill. factory where mitsubishi in a joint venture with chrysler corporation called diamond-star motors produced the mitsubishi eclipse, plymouth laser and dodge avenger, among others. while rivian had been active the past several years, its big public reveal came at the la auto show in november when it revealed its all-electric r1t pickup and r1s suv. deliveries of these vehicles to customers in the u.s., which use a flexible skateboard platform, are expected to begin in late 2020."
"dvr maker tivo is preparing to split its company into two businesses: one, focused on its products like its bolt family of dvrs, and the other on its licensing and intellectual property businesses. the move will help to address some of the complexities with those businesses, tivo interim ceo raghu rau, explained, which may make it more attractive to buyers. by splitting the company into two, tivo may be able to “facilitate strategic transactions,” with interested parties, rau said on the company’s q4 earnings call this week with investors. the ceo also noted that tivo was in active discussions with parties interested in each of its product and its ip businesses, but the overall strategic review process — which began a year ago — was taking longer than tivo had anticipated. “so we do agree that this process has taken longer than we had hoped, particularly because of the complexity and uniqueness of our two businesses,” rau told investors. “we’re hoping that we’ll give you another update the next quarter based on the ongoing discussions that we are having. but beyond that, i’m not willing to put a time limit on when this will happen because the interest of the board and the management is to ensure that we get the best outcome for the shareholders and that’s what this whole review process has been focused on,” he said. the issue seems to be that potential acquirers may want either the licensing business or the products business, but not both. according to a report from lightreading, that’s definitely the case with potential buyers, sources told them. in addition, tivo was described as being reluctant to move forward on anything significant until it knew more about the outcomes of its legal battles with comcast over licensing and patents. rau noted that tivo hadn’t actually announced that tivo is separating, only that it’s now working on the various logistics issues that have to be addressed in order to separate the business, like the preparation of historical financials, audits and understanding of tax implications. the company also said it ruled out a “transformative acquisition” a couple of quarters into its ongoing strategic review process, which began in february 2018. tivo itself was acquired by rovi corp. for $1.1 billion in 2016, and the combined entity kept the name tivo. the deal enhanced tivo’s patent portfolio, and today nine of the top 10 pay tv service providers in the u.s. license its portfolio of ip, except for comcast, whose license lapsed (which is why it’s in the courts.) given the relative recency of that merger, tivo’s decision to now split the business again strongly hints that it has had trouble finding a deal for the company as it stands today. tivo remains a household name, thanks to its line of tivo-branded dvrs that cater to pay tv subscribers and cord cutters alike. but the company has made some missteps along the way, as it tried to keep up with the increasingly competitive market. for instance, in an effort to differentiate itself, its newer bolt dvr adopted an odd, angled shape that some found aesthetically displeasing. that matters, of course, because these dvrs have to be on display in your living room. (unlike, say, amazon’s new fire tv recast, which can be hidden away in a back room of the house.) in addition, tivo’s model, which relies on monthly subscriptions (or a larger “lifetime” fee) is harder for consumers to stomach at a time when there’s so much choice among media devices. combined with the larger shift away from pay tv and consumer adoption of players like roku and amazon fire tv — even among pay tv subscribers — tivo’s business is not what it once was. the company in its earnings reported this tuesday brought in a loss of $2.33 per share to end fiscal year 2018. in the year-ago quarter, tivo had posted a profit of 28 cents. its revenue for the period was $168.46 million, 21 percent down from q4 2017, and under analysts’ estimates of $173.85 million."
"there is a deep dilemma facing startup founders that i think just isn’t brought to light often enough. on one hand, almost all (and i do mean almost all) founders are reasonably ethical people. they can be over-optimistic, they can over-promise, they can be inexperienced around management, but at their core, they want to improve the world, build something new, and yes, make (a lot) of money while doing it. yet, if you really want to grow fast — so fast that you can go from piddling startup to $1.7 billion-valued banking unicorn in less than four years — then there are only so many ways to do that ethically. or even legally, given that the laws around industries like banking aren’t designed for high growth, but rather sedentary expansion. here’s a lesson that i think founders internalize very, very early: growth solves all problems. and it is absolutely, 100 percent true. growth absolutely solves all problems. want to make your next fundraise a cinch? if you grow 5x or 7x year-over-year, watch as dozens of venture firms squabble to get access to that cap table. want to hire faster and attract better talent? growing at top speed is an easy way to lock in those people. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. and if you think the board acts as a guard rail, you have never seen the giddy excitement of a vc who is seeing their yacht / napa vineyard / atherton estate being financed before their very eyes. boards don’t ask tough questions in periods of high growth, they double down: “do everything to keep this rocket ship shooting for the stratosphere.” in these situations, it is nearly impossible to balance growth and ethics. you can’t just say, “turn on the money laundering thing again and we will accept 5x instead of 7x” or whatever. the whole organism of the startup has been geared for growth. hell, even the people not working for the company (but want to) are geared for growth. every salary bump, equity distribution, performance evaluation, feedback, kpi and firing is predicated on growth. sometimes you get away with it, and sometimes you don’t. uber got away with it, zenefits did not. so where does revolut sit, which i’ve been foreshadowing here? by now, you might have come across the three-part story arc of revolut, a digital banking service based in london. in part one, revolut is a fintech darling founded in july 2015 that has since raised $336 million in venture capital within four years at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to crunchbase. insane growth, huge market, real product. it’s the best first act for a startup one can possibly hope for. then the bad news started hitting hard this week. in act two, we get this wired exposé by emiliano mellino that discusses the atrocious working conditions of the company along with deeply questionable employee interview tactics: she did a 30-minute job interview over google hangouts with the london-based head of business development, andrius biceika, and was immediately told she had passed to the next round, which would involve a small test. “the surprise came when i received the task and it asked me to get the company as many clients as possible, with each one depositing €10 into the app,” says laura. and using fear to goad performance: last spring, ceo nikolay storonsky sent an announcement to all staff through the company’s slack messaging service, saying that any members of staff “with performance rating [sic] ‘significantly below expectations’ will be fired without any negotiation after the review”. … around this time, ceo nikolay storonsky gave an interview to business insider where he said revolut’s philosophy was to “get shit done”, a slogan that is emblazoned on the company’s london office walls in bright neon lights. in an echo to what was going on in these calls, storonsky would go on to say in the interview that the company attracted people that want to grow and “growing is always through pain”. well, there is more growth to come, because act three is going to bring a very painful episode for the company. my colleague jon russell noted that revolut’s cfo has resigned in the wake of a daily telegraph investigation showing that revolut had switched off the anti-money-laundering safeguards at the company, because, well, it got in the way of growth. let’s be clear: we all love a rapidly growing startup. we all want to invest in or join a winner. but what are we willing to forego to get it? are we willing to push ethical boundaries? are we willing to use dark patterns to force those numbers higher? are we willing to break the law and potentially go to prison? our love of growth often knows no bounds. in context, i’m sure revolut’s decision came easily, but of course, for disinterested observers, the idea that you would switch off the aml system at a banking startup just looks like complete stupidity. yet, i am not sure i am ready to blame the employees of revolut (or its leaders, frankly) before i place the blame on a culture that demands extreme growth and dislikes it when the consequences come to bear. you can’t get extreme growth without something breaking. we need to decide which value is more important for us. extra crunch ethics series not sure we are going to be able to answer all the questions posed by revolut, but extra crunch will be hosting a series of dialogues around tech ethics in the coming weeks that will try to parse some of the tough challenges that come from technology and startups these days. stay tuned. why fundamental self-interest causes u.s. infrastructure to fall flat on its face simon mcgill via getty images written by arman tabatabai yesterday, dj gribbin, a fellow at brookings and a senior u.s. government infrastructure official, published an op-ed in which he attributes the u.s.’ infrastructure struggles largely to 1) a misunderstanding of federal fund availability, 2) the fragmentation and variability of local infrastructure needs and 3) misaligned incentives for local politicians and contractors. local politicians push heavily for the federal government to cover a portion of their bill, advertising the money as free to their constituents. in reality, investing federal funds is a zero-sum game that requires either more taxation, higher debt or pulling money from elsewhere. what results are the competitive bid and bureaucratic review processes we discussed earlier this week that ultimately lead to gamesmanship and misinformation. the federal-local coordination has grown more difficult as projects have become more localized with region-specific needs and benefits, compared to national projects of old like the highway system. now, executing local developments depends on coordination between federal, state and local governments, leading to the political pissing contests we all know and love. in gribbin’s mind, the biggest flaw in the u.s.’ approach to infrastructure — also raised in our conversation with infrastructure expert phil plotch — is the misaligned incentive system that encourages bad behavior from all parties. the complexity of approval and funding processes causes local politicians to either delay projects as they lobby for federal funding or to “overpromise and underdeliver” on costs and benefits to push a project through. similarly, competitive rfp bidding used to reduce cost estimates encourages contractors to similarly overpromise, leading to plan revisions, construction issues and delays that seem to be inevitable for every major project. clearly more needs to be done to align the incentives of each of these players. software and infrastructure jaylazarin via getty images written by arman tabatabai new york city rail operators grew frustrated this week with the contractors hired to install a new safety system. fumbled management and failed execution on what was thought to be a simple tech integration have caused multi-year delays, potentially pushing completion past the deadline set by the federal railroad administration for railroads across the country to upgrade their safety systems. only about one-tenth of the mandated rails had successfully upgraded their system as of last year as local agencies continue to struggle with designing software and hardware platforms compatible with other trains that may use their lines. that pattern is also found in new york. from the wall street journal article: the projects have suffered a series of setbacks because of understaffing by the contractors as well as software and hardware failures. those failures include the recall of antennas that were installed on more than 1,000 rail cars and that were later found to be defective. “it was a novice error and we did not believe we had hired novices,” mta board member susan metzger said. the new york project mimics issues plaguing projects throughout the u.s., where contractors use the “overpromise, underdeliver” strategy to win competitive bids. add in software incompetence and you get the mess that new york is facing now. dc commutes suck more than in nyc and sf, even before amazon materializes richard sharrocks via getty images written by arman tabatabai according to a new data set from bloomberg, the cost of commuting into washington, d.c. is higher than any other metro in the u.s. though density is clearly a factor here, workers in the greater d.c. area face the longest commute time in the country at nearly 80 minutes on average. bloomberg then derived a “score” for the opportunity cost of commutes based on average annual incomes and average total annual commuting hours per worker, weighted based for other externalities such as how early or late average departures were. d.c. is in the midst of seriously expanding its metrorail system but, unsurprisingly, the project has gone far from smoothly. bloomberg’s findings stress the need for an improved transit system in the region, but based on precedent and progress to date it’s unclear if and when the full expansion will be complete and at what ungodly cost. we’re planning on diving

"it’s not only softbank that’s eyeing up the opportunity to tap into the quickly expanding market for e-commerce in latin america. mercadolibre, a marketplace and financial services powerhouse based out of argentina and serving 18 countries across the region, has announced that paypal is investing $750 million, and investment firm dragoneer another $100 million, as part of a $1.8 billion equity offering to grow its business — specifically to expand the functionality of its e-commerce platform, improve its logistics infrastructure and invest in financial technologies “that further solidify the company’s position as a powerful provider of inclusive end-to-end financial technology and payments solutions.” the remaining $1 billion of the equity offering will be offered as common stock, the company said. paypal and dragoneer’s investments are contingent on the company raising the remainder publicly, although judging by the company’s track record as a public stock, and the fact that paypal also announced this news on its own site, it doesn’t appear the parties are in great doubt about the deal’s completion. mercadolibre is traded on nasdaq and currently has a market cap of $21.75 billion. the investment is both a financial and strategic one for mercadolibre and paypal. after getting spun out from ebay several years ago, paypal has been on a mission to diversify its customer base to include a wider variety of use cases and partnerships to power payments for different marketplaces. “digital commerce in latin america is experiencing tremendous growth and mercadolibre is well-positioned for continued leadership,” said dan schulman, president and ceo, paypal, in a statement. “we’ve been impressed with the digital commerce and payments ecosystem marcos and his team have built. we see great opportunities to integrate our respective capabilities to create unique and valuable payment experiences for our combined 500 million customers throughout the region and around the world.” the two have already worked together and the financial commitment paypal is making here not only will help it reap dividends from mercadolibre’s business growth, but also ensure that it integrates ever more of its features in prominent ways to drive more transactions on its own rails. and given how payments is actually more localised than many people might assume, it also gives the company a direct pipeline into tracking and catering to consumer and merchant tastes and preferences when it comes to buying and selling goods and related financial services. “over the past 20 years, we have heavily invested in developing the preeminent e-commerce and fintech ecosystem in latin america,” said marcos galperin, ceo of mercado libre, in a statement. “we are excited to welcome these investments which will allow us to significantly accelerate our growth. we look forward to accelerating our leadership in ecommerce and payments and foster financial inclusion in latin america as a result of our alliance with a global leader in the industry such as paypal.” at a time when more mature markets like the u.s. and western europe are slowing down in their e-commerce growth (while still remaining huge markets in their own right), the opportunity in developing markets like latin america is a big one. as softbank revealed last week when it unveiled its own $2 billion fund to back tech startups in the region, more than 50 million people in the region are now categorised as “middle class,” with increased disposable income. the region accounts for 10 percent of the world’s population and 8 percent of the world’s gdp, two times the gdp of india and half that of china. there are some 375 million internet users and 250 million smartphone users, putting it ahead of the u.s. in terms of sheer numbers. moreover, retail e-commerce has nearly doubled in the last three years, going to $54 billion in 2018 from $29.8 billion in 2015, figures that have definitely fueled mercadolibre’s own growth. in 2018, the company sold more than 334 million items, amounting to over $12 billion of gross merchandise volume. payment transactions on mercadopago, its payments business unit, increased by 70 percent during 2018, totaling 389 million transactions and $18 billion of total payment volume, the company said. at the same time, these are nascent numbers: some 400 million people are still without bank accounts or credit histories in the region. in terms of the other big investor being announced in this round, dragoneer is a legendary and very experienced investor when it comes to interesting opportunities in e-commerce. the company has stakes in other giant regional e-commerce marketplaces like alibaba and flipkart; disruptive “gig economy” leaders like airbnb, uber, doordash and instacart, as well as a plethora of other huge startup names like slack and snap. it seems mercadolibre is currently the top bet for not only competing against the likes of amazon, but a range of smaller local players that are also looking to tap into this quickly expanding economy — in other words, the same opportunity softbank is chasing, but from the other end of the field. “through its investments in fintech, logistics, and customer experience, mercadolibre is solidifying its leading market position in e-commerce and digital payments across latin america, and we believe we are witnessing a major tipping point in the region,” said marc stad, founder and managing partner of dragoneer investment group, in a statement. “we’ve known marcos and his team for over a decade and are thrilled to partner with them through this high growth and transformative period.” goldman sachs is acting as sole financial advisor to mercadolibre on the paypal and dragoneer investments, and cleary gottlieb is serving as mercadolibre’s legal advisor. goldman sachs, j.p. morgan and morgan stanley are acting as joint bookrunners on the public equity offering. as a side note, it’s interesting to consider the approach that mercadolibre is taking with this round. paypal’s investment is coming in the form of a purchase of common stock, while dragoneer’s is coming by way of an affiliate that has agreed to purchase $100 million of series a perpetual convertible preferred stock, with the rest to be raised publicly. when you consider how lyft, and likely uber, and many other very highly valued, high-profile scaled startups are likely also to list publicly, this could end up being a route that we see getting used more often when these companies, which are all still operating at a loss and will need to raise capital, might opt to take, too."
"well, that didn’t take long. just three months after raising $50 million in series a funding, e-scooter rentals startup voi technology has added another $30 million to its balance sheet. the new round sees existing investors vostok new ventures, balderton capital, localglobe and raine ventures participate again, alongside new investors project a and creandum. the inclusion of project a won’t be entirely new news to close readers of techcrunch. based on my own sources, i reported that the berlin-based early-stage vc was in the running in late october, and it was a surprise not to see the firm on the list of backers when voi announced its series a a month later. this new round sees those loose ends tidied up nicely. a number of angel investors also participated. they include cristina stenbeck (kinnevik), justin mateen (co-founder of tinder), keith richman (board member, grubhub), jeff wilke (amazon), sujay jaswa (founder of wndrco), sujay tyle (ceo frontier car group), diego piacentini (former head of international business, amazon) christian leone (founder of luxor capital) and spencer rascoff (ex-ceo of zillow). voi says the new capital will be used to ramp up expansion across europe and invest in r&d. the company is also now claiming to be the leading “home-grown” e-scooter rentals company in europe — as opposed to u.s.-founded lime and bird. in seven months, voi says it has garnered a customer base of over 400,000 riders, who have taken a total of more than 750,000 rides. other competitors operating in various parts of europe include flash — the stealthy mobility startup from delivery hero and team europe founder lukasz gadowski that recently raised €55 million in series a funding — as well as berlin’s wind mobility ($22 million) and tier (€25 million). taxify has also announced its entrance into e-scooter rentals, and silicon valley’s bird and lime not only operate in europe but have received substantial investment from three of europe’s top venture capital firms. index and accel have backed bird, and atomico has backed lime. staying on message, voi says that key to its success to date is working collaboratively with city authorities across the continent, including developing a code of conduct in stockholm “to help the city’s multiple scooter-sharing operators work more safely and efficiently together”. however, that didn’t stop voi having its license temporarily revoked in madrid, alongside lime and wind after a change in the law required a change in the way e-scooter firms operate. it returned to the spanish city in february. meanwhile, the company says its strongest markets so far are in the nordics. namely, stockholm, gothenburg, malmö, lund, uppsala and copenhagen, most of which it says will reach profitability in q1. the e-scooter rental service is also live in paris, lyon, madrid, malaga, zaragoza, murcia, lisbon and faro. today also sees a launch in oslo, with helsinki and other cities launching later this month. italy, germany, norway and france are named as near-future expansions."
"youtube music is coming to the next critical battlefield for streaming music services: india. the company announced this week it’s launching its ad-supported version of youtube music for free in the country, as well as youtube music premium, its subscription that offers background listening, offline downloads and an ad-free experience for ₹99 a month. in addition, youtube premium, which extends offline play, background listening and the removal of ads across youtube, is also launching in india. this will include access to youtube original programming like cobra kai, bts: burn the stage and others, and ships with the music premium subscription for ₹129 (rupees) per month. this is not google’s first entry into the streaming music market in india. the company already operates google play music — and now, those subscribers will gain access to youtube music as part of their subscription, the company says. india is a key market for streaming services because of its sizable population of 1.3 billion people, many of whom are still coming online for the first time. (only some 483 million are active internet users today). already, apple and amazon operate their music services in the region in addition to local players like gaana, saavn and others. spotify also made an india launch a strategic focus this year. however, spotify’s entry into india has been complicated by a licensing dispute with warner music (wmg’s warner/chappell publishing arm, specifically). that conflict led to spotify arriving in the market without some of today’s biggest artists, like cardi b. and ed sheeran. the case has been ugly: warner sued spotify asking for an emergency injunction; spotify then accused warner of “abusive behavior;” and warner called spotify a “liar.” despite its legal troubles, spotify hit 1 million users in india within a week of launching. that bodes well for its potential when it gets through the legal battles. unlike spotify, youtube music is fully licensed as it enters the region — a potential competitive advantage for the time being. it also has a deal with samsung where galaxy s10 owners can gain four months of youtube premium/youtube music premium for free. (but spotify has a deeper samsung partnership, involving preinstalls and bixby integrations.) for youtube, a win in india is needed, as its streaming music service hasn’t picked up traction to date. to some extent, that’s because youtube users know they can get to music videos for free, but it also has to do with google’s baffling strategy in operating two separate brands around music. apple doesn’t make this mistake. it leverages the power of its platform to promote its only music service, apple music. that may have gotten it into trouble, though — today, spotify filed a complaint with the european commission over the “apple tax” levied on its rivals and its restrictive rules. google has said it plans to merge its two music services at some point, but for now the split likely leads to confusion. “india is where the multi-lingual music scene thrives,” said lyor cohen, global head of music, youtube, in a statement. “it’s interesting to note how indian artists have consistently claimed top spots over the last few months in the global youtube top artists chart. with youtube music, we are hoping to bring the best in global and indian music to millions of fans across india, and give them an immersive music experience, with the magic of music on youtube,” he added."
"there’s a trend here. after samsung and vizio, lg is also adding support for apple’s ecosystem to its tv operating system webos. specifically, people who buy an lg tv in 2019 should be able to share content to their tvs using airplay 2. tvs will also be compatible with homekit, letting you create custom scenarios and control your tv using siri. “many of our customers may also happen to have apple devices,” senior director of home entertainment product marketing tim alessi said during the company’s ces press conference. “lg has been working with apple as well to create a streamlined user experience. so i’m very pleased to announce today that we’re adding apple airplay to our 2019 tvs.” if you have an iphone, ipad or mac, you can send video content to your tv using the airplay icon in your favorite video app. you can also mirror your display in case you want to show some non-video content. 2019 lg tvs also support airplay audio, which means that you can send music and podcasts on your tv, pair your tv with other airplay 2-compatible speakers. new lg tvs also support homekit. it means that you can add your tv to the home app on your ios device and mac. after that, you can control basic tv features from the home app. you can also assign siri keywords so that you can manage your tv using siri on your ios device or homepod. homekit support lets you create custom actions. for instance, you can say “hey siri, turn on the tv” and have siri turn on the tv and dim your philips hue lights. unlike samsung, lg didn’t announce an itunes app. so you can’t rent or buy movies and tv shows straight from your tv. buying something from your phone and then using airplay is still a bit clunky. lg also said that 2019 tvs come with amazon alexa and google assistant support. but this is less surprising as you can find hundreds of devices that support those voice assistants. finally, the company is adding a home dashboard to control a wide variety of home devices from your tv. details are still thin on this feature. it’s unclear whether lg will roll out some of all of these software features to old tvs. watching all tv manufacturers add airplay and homekit support one by one reminds me of the year tv manufacturers all announced native netflix apps for their tv. it’s clear that apple is following in netflix’s footsteps and opening up. apple has been working on a subscription-based streaming service for months. and the company wants to support as many devices as possible."
"app and web developers are always trying to figure out better ways of keeping their users engaged on their platforms for longer. today, amazon is launching a service that it hopes those developers will use to do just that. amazon moments — as it is called — will let developers create actions — “moments” — that it wants users to perform — such as watching several episodes of a series if its a streaming service; or taking out a subscription if its a news site — and giving users actual physical gifts in exchange for doing so. the service is going live in 100 countries today, amazon said. items that are eligible to be gifted as part of the moments scheme will come in a catalogue — amazon said that there are “millions” of products in it already, both from amazon and select third-party vendors — and will sit alongside other kinds of products that incentivize users to be more engaged in apps, games and other digital services such as virtual currencies and gift cards. “this adds to the variety and lets developers do something they haven’t been able to do before,” said amir kabbara, amazon’s head of moments, in an interview. he added that they are proving to be very effective so far in pilots that amazon has run with a number of publishers and other developers — the washington post, tiktok, sony crackle, sesame workshop, usa today, sago mini and bell canada were among the early testers — with customers on average two to three times more likely to complete actions versus test-using virtual items. while offering a “gift with purchase” is nothing new in the world of retail, it’s been a trickier proposition when it comes to online commerce, because then the company setting up the promotion has to handle the fulfillment of the gifts, and that may stray far from its core competency as a business. for amazon, this simply maximises the infrastructure that the e-commerce giant has already built to run its own marketplace, and it gives another opportunity to sell items from that marketplace. moments comes in the form of an api that the developer and marketing team can build into an app or website, and for now there are a couple of ways that a company can be flexible in terms of what actually gets gifted. there can be a specific item as the reward — for example, the washington post offered echo dots to people who subscribed — or it can be a gift certificate toward the purchase of an item like a book, which the customer then gets to choose. they pay for the service by way of cpa — cost per “action” — meaning only when the action is completed and the reward is redeemed. amazon, as a result, gets two different revenue streams from this, as the marketplace operator and as the exchange selling the marketing unit to the developer/marketer. moments can also be segmented by customer types. amazon notes: “if keeping an active payer engaged is worth $50, you can set a high-value action and offer $40 headphone sets with a comfortable margin of error. in addition, customer targeting allows you to tailor rewards to the lifetime value of each user segment. you could offer a $5 reward to new users, a $25 reward to active payers, and a $200 reward to top spenders.” over time, it will be interesting to see if amazon applies more of its personalisation prowess to the product. just as advertising — or visiting amazon’s homepage — is an exercise in seeing how your interests are tracked and aggregated to present you with what you are most likely to buy, you could imagine moments promotions that will know that i already own an echo dot (or two) and that what i probably really want is an eero. given amazon’s wider ambitions to grow its advertising and adtech businesses, it’s not outside the realm of possibility."
"apple music is launching on amazon fire tv in the u.s. today, after rolling out in december to amazon’s echo line of smart speakers. the news is notable as it’s yet another example of the eased tensions between the two rivals following apple ceo tim cook’s 2017 announcement of apple’s agreement with amazon. their deal allowed amazon’s prime video app to launch on apple tv and saw the return of apple products on amazon.com. since then, the companies have made several moves to honor their deal. last year, for example, amazon expanded its assortment of apple inventory to include other devices besides apple tv — like ipads, iphones, apple watch and beats headphones. it also brought its freetime unlimited app to ios. and most recently, apple music arrived on echo. now it’s coming to amazon fire tv, too. the launch will allow apple music subscribers the ability to access the streaming service’s catalog of 50 million songs just by asking alexa. users can request songs, artists, playlists and albums by saying things like “alexa, play today’s hits on apple music,” or “alexa, play music by [artist’s name] on apple music,” for example. on fire tv cube, apple music can also be streamed within multi-room music groups. to use apple music on fire tv, you’ll have to enable the apple music skill and link your account. (those who had already done so in order to listen on their echo device won’t need to do this again.) amazon isn’t the only company benefiting from apple’s decision to shift more of its company’s focus to subscription services — like its streaming music offering and, soon, its streaming video service. apple also recently announced a partnership with samsung to bring itunes content to samsung smart tvs through a dedicated app and related deals with tv makers like vizio and lg to support airplay. it’s said to be working on a similar deal to get airplay supported on roku. apple music is available to u.s. fire tv owners starting today. amazon says apple music support will roll out to both fire tv and echo users in the u.k. in the weeks ahead."
"free tv and movie streaming service tubi is preparing to double down on content acquisitions this year, the company announced this morning. the service today offers over 12,000 movies and tv series, totaling 40,000 hours of content. all of this can be streamed for free as the content is paid for not via customer subscriptions, but rather by advertising. now the company is preparing to invest more than $100 million to expand its library this year, after hitting profitability in q4 2018, and tackle new markets. founded in 2014, tubi has benefited from the trend toward cord cutting, as well as the increasing number of younger consumers who never opt to pay for cable or satellite tv in the first place — sometimes called the “cord nevers.” the company claims that its viewership increased by more than 4.3 times from december 2017 to december 2018, which allowed it to hit the profitability milestone. in the fourth quarter alone, it saw more revenue than in all of 2017 combined, it also noted. and it grew revenues by 180+ percent in 2018. on the advertising front, the company says it ran campaigns from more than 1,000 advertisers in 2018, including those from the majority of the top cpg and automotive companies. however, several aspects of tubi’s business aren’t being disclosed alongside today’s news — only the highlights. what the company won’t say is how many monthly active users it has, how many hours they watch or how many ad impressions take place across its platform. these sorts of metrics are critical to measuring success in ad-supported video. according to estimates from sensor tower, tubi has close to 51 million installs on mobile, with 1.7 million of those coming in december 2018, a 21 percent year-over-year increase. that could indicate that tubi’s viewership growth is largely taking place on other platforms — like tvs through media players or deals with service providers, like comcast, for instance. along with its plans to grow its library, tubi is preparing to expand outside the u.s. and canada, with the first market launching this quarter. to help fund its growth and content acquisitions, tubi closed on $25 million in debt financing from silicon valley bank in december. these plans come at a time when tubi’s business model has been seeing increased competition, and the company has been rumored to be in talks with viacom. for example, roku entered ad-supported programming with its own the roku channel launch in fall 2017, and said earlier this month it now has 27 million user accounts. of course, roku doesn’t break that down by how many use its platform for other services, versus those who specifically launch roku’s own free content — but that is its ad-supported channel’s potential reach. in addition to roku, tubi competes against walmart’s ad-supported video on vudu; amazon-owned imdb’s new service freedive; viacom’s latest acquisition, pluto tv; sinclair’s local broadcaster-focused service stirr; and soon, plex. comcast will also launch a free streaming service for its pay tv customers in 2020. tubi, like many of these services, believes in its potential as consumers tire of being nickeled and dimed for video subscriptions. “in 2018 we at tubi saw tremendous growth as consumers, fatigued by svod subscriptions and services, sought alternative entertainment choices,” said farhad massoudi, ceo of tubi, in a statement. “we will continue to use profits to make bigger bets on content, enhance the viewing experience, and continue to press ahead into new grounds in what is our core advantage: technology and data,” he added. in reality, however, tubi competes for attention among a growing streaming market, which includes those paid subscription video offerings. today’s consumers are building out customized bundles that make sense for them — a little netflix and hbo perhaps, fleshed out with some free content through services like tubi, for example. tubi’s advantage, of course, is that it doesn’t have to spend the billions on content and originals that subscription video services like netflix do to win users. instead, it relies on titles that have mainstream appeal, but may not be winning any awards — like older movies, kids shows, b-flicks, horror films and reality tv. at the end of the day, however, tubi won’t necessarily gain from people tiring of subscription video, but from the growing influx of cord cutters who are searching for older or niche content not included in subscription libraries — or who just want to watch a free movie."
"the reception to facebook portal has been, at best, a mixed bag. between the company’s ongoing privacy woes and a lackluster response, facebook likely didn’t get the response it was anticipating for its first in-house hardware creation. still, both the portal and portal plus are floating around the four-star mark over on amazon. not too shabby. new york times columnist kevin roose noticed something fishy in all of this, noting on twitter that many of the verified reviewers on the site bore the same names as facebook employees. “reviewing your employer’s products is definitely against amazon’s rules,” he wrote today. “it’s also not exactly an indicator of confidence in how well they’re selling organically!” neither coordinated nor directed from the company. from an internal post at the launch: “we, unequivocally, do not want facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to amazon.” we will ask them to take down. — boz (@boztank) january 17, 2019 facebook’s ar/vr vp andrew bosworth was quick to respond, tweeting, “[n]either coordinated nor directed from the company. from an internal post at the launch: ‘we, unequivocally, do not want facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to amazon.’ we will ask them to take down.” this is just the latest controversy in the product’s short life. at launch, bosworth felt it necessary to clarify concerns about whether facebook was using the product to listen to calls and collect data. and while apparently not a calculated effort on facebook’s part, it does leave one wondering about internal fallout surrounding the product’s negative response."
"few issues divide the tech community quite like privacy. much of silicon valley’s wealth has been built on data-driven advertising platforms, and yet, there remain constant concerns about the invasiveness of those platforms. such concerns have intensified in just the last few weeks as france’s privacy regulator placed a record fine on google under europe’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) rules which the company now plans to appeal. yet with global platform usage and service sales continuing to tick up, we asked a panel of eight privacy experts: “has anything fundamentally changed around privacy in tech in 2019? what is the state of privacy and has the outlook changed?”  this week’s participants include: albert gidari – consulting director of privacy at stanford’s center for internet and society; professor at stanford law school gabriel weinberg – ceo and founder of duckduckgo melika carroll -senior vp of global government affairs at the internet association johnny ryan – chief policy and industry relations officer at brave john miller –  vp of global policy and law at the information technology industry council nuala o’connor – president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology chris baker – senior vp and general manager of emea at box christopher wolf – founder and chair of the future privacy forum; senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing on internet law, privacy and data protection policy techcrunch is experimenting with new content forms. consider this a recurring venue for debate, where leading experts – with a diverse range of vantage points and opinions – provide us with thoughts on some of the biggest issues currently in tech, startups and venture. if you have any feedback, please reach out: arman.tabatabai@techcrunch.com. thoughts & responses: albert gidari albert gidari is the consulting director of privacy at the stanford center for internet and society. he was a partner for over 20 years at perkins coie llp, achieving a top-ranking in privacy law by chambers, before retiring to consult with cis on its privacy program. he negotiated the first-ever “privacy by design” consent decree with the federal trade commission. a recognized expert on electronic surveillance law, he brought the first public lawsuit before the foreign intelligence surveillance court, seeking the right of providers to disclose the volume of national security demands received and the number of affected user accounts, ultimately resulting in greater public disclosure of such requests. there is no doubt that the privacy environment changed in 2018 with the passage of california’s consumer privacy act (ccpa), implementation of the european union’s general data protection regulation (gdpr), and new privacy laws enacted around the globe. “while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.”” for one thing, large tech companies have grown huge privacy compliance organizations to meet their new regulatory obligations. for another, the major platforms now are lobbying for passage of a federal privacy law in the u.s. this is not surprising after a year of privacy miscues, breaches and negative privacy news. but does all of this mean a fundamental change is in store for privacy? i think not. the fundamental model sustaining the internet is based upon the exchange of user data for free service. as long as advertising dollars drive the growth of the internet, regulation simply will tinker around the edges, setting sideboards to dictate the terms of the exchange. the tech companies may be more accountable for how they handle data and to whom they disclose it, but the fact is that data will continue to be collected from all manner of people, places and things. indeed, if the past year has shown anything it is that two rules are fundamental: (1) everything that can be connected to the internet will be connected; and (2) everything that can be collected, will be collected, analyzed, used and monetized. it is inexorable. while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.” no one even knows what “more privacy” means. if it means that users will have more control over the data they share, that is laudable but not achievable in a world where people have no idea how many times or with whom they have shared their information already. can you name all the places over your lifetime where you provided your ssn and other identifying information? and given that the largest data collector (and likely least secure) is government, what does control really mean? all this is not to say that privacy regulation is futile. but it is to recognize that nothing proposed today will result in a fundamental shift in privacy policy or provide a panacea of consumer protection. better privacy hygiene and more accountability on the part of tech companies is a good thing, but it doesn’t solve the privacy paradox that those same users who want more privacy broadly share their information with others who are less trustworthy on social media (ask jeff bezos), or that the government hoovers up data at rate that makes tech companies look like pikers (visit a smart city near you). many years ago, i used to practice environmental law. i watched companies strive to comply with new laws intended to control pollution by creating compliance infrastructures and teams aimed at preventing, detecting and deterring violations. today, i see the same thing at the large tech companies – hundreds of employees have been hired to do “privacy” compliance. the language is the same too: cradle to grave privacy documentation of data flows for a product or service; audits and assessments of privacy practices; data mapping; sustainable privacy practices. in short, privacy has become corporatized and industrialized. true, we have cleaner air and cleaner water as a result of environmental law, but we also have made it lawful and built businesses around acceptable levels of pollution. companies still lawfully dump arsenic in the water and belch volatile organic compounds in the air. and we still get environmental catastrophes. so don’t expect today’s “clean privacy law” to eliminate data breaches or profiling or abuses. the privacy world is complicated and few people truly understand the number and variety of companies involved in data collection and processing, and none of them are in congress. the power to fundamentally change the privacy equation is in the hands of the people who use the technology (or choose not to) and in the hands of those who design it, and maybe that’s where it should be. gabriel weinberg gabriel weinberg is the founder and ceo of privacy-focused search engine duckduckgo. coming into 2019, interest in privacy solutions is truly mainstream. there are signs of this everywhere (media, politics, books, etc.) and also in duckduckgo’s growth, which has never been faster. with solid majorities now seeking out private alternatives and other ways to be tracked less online, we expect governments to continue to step up their regulatory scrutiny and for privacy companies like duckduckgo to continue to help more people take back their privacy. “consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information.” we’re also seeing companies take action beyond mere regulatory compliance, reflecting this new majority will of the people and its tangible effect on the market. just this month we’ve seen apple’s tim cook call for stronger privacy regulation and the new york times report strong ad revenue in europe after stopping the use of ad exchanges and behavioral targeting. at its core, this groundswell is driven by the negative effects that stem from the surveillance business model. the percentage of people who have noticed ads following them around the internet, or who have had their data exposed in a breach, or who have had a family member or friend experience some kind of credit card fraud or identity theft issue, reached a boiling point in 2018. on top of that, people learned of the extent to which the big platforms like google and facebook that collect the most data are used to propagate misinformation, discrimination, and polarization. consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information. fortunately, there are alternatives to the surveillance business model and more companies are setting a new standard of trust online by showcasing alternative models. melika carroll melika carroll is senior vice president, global government affairs at internet association, which represents over 45 of the world’s leading internet companies, including google, facebook, amazon, twitter, uber, airbnb and others. we support a modern, national privacy law that provides people meaningful control over the data they provide to companies so they can make the most informed choices about how that data is used, seen, and shared. “any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online.” internet companies believe all americans should have the ability to access, correct, delete, and download the data they provide to companies. americans will benefit most from a federal approach to privacy – as opposed to a patchwork of state laws – that protects their privacy regardless of where they live. if someone in new york is video chatting with their grandmother in florida, they should both benefit from the same privacy protections. it’s also important to consider that all companies – both online and offline – use and collect data. any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online. two other important pieces of any federal privacy law include user expectations and the context in which data is shared with third parties. expectations may vary based on a person’s relationship with a company, the service they expect to receive, and the sensitivity of the data they’re sharing. for example, you expect a car rental company to be able to track the location of the rented vehicle that doesn’t get returned. you don’t expect the car rental company to track your real-time location and sell that data to the highest bidder. additionally, the same piece of data can have different sensitivities depending on the context in which it’s used or shared. for example, your name on a business card may not be as sensitive as your name on the sign in sheet at an addiction support group meeting. this is a unique time in washington as there is bipartisan support in both chambers of congress as well as in the administration for a federal privacy law. our industry is committed to working with policymakers and other stakeholders to find an american approach to privacy that protects individuals’ privacy and allows companies to innovate and develop products people love. johnny ryan dr. johnny ryan frhists is chief policy & industry relations officer at brave. his previous roles include head of ecosystem at pagefair, and chief innovation officer

regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware.” first, the gdpr is emerging as a de facto international standard. in the coming years, the application of gdpr-like laws for commercial use of consumers’ personal data in the eu, britain (post-eu), japan, india, brazil, south korea, malaysia, argentina, and china will bring more than half of global gdp under a similar standard. whether this emerging standard helps or harms united states firms will be determined by whether the united states enacts and actively enforces robust federal privacy laws. unless there is a federal gdpr-like law in the united states, there may be a degree of friction and the potential of isolation for united states companies. however, there is an opportunity in this trend. the united states can assume the global lead by doing two things. first, enact a federal law that borrows from the gdpr, including a comprehensive definition of “personal data”, and robust “purpose specification”. second, invest in world-leading regulation that pursues test cases, and defines practical standards. cutting edge enforcement of common principles-based standards is de facto leadership. second, privacy and antitrust law are moving closer to each other, and might squeeze big tech companies very tightly indeed. big tech companies “cross-use” user data from one part of their business to prop up others. the result is that a company can leverage all the personal information accumulated from its users in one line of business, and for one purpose, to dominate other lines of business too. this is likely to have anti-competitive effects. rather than competing on the merits, the company can enjoy the unfair advantage of massive network effects even though it may be starting from scratch in a new line of business. this stifles competition and hurts innovation and consumer choice. antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions have addressed this. in 2015, the belgian national lottery was fined for re-using personal information acquired through its monopoly for a different, and incompatible, line of business. as lawmakers and regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware. john miller john miller is the vp for global policy and law at the information technology industry council (iti), a d.c. based advocate group for the high tech sector.  miller leads iti’s work on cybersecurity, privacy, surveillance, and other technology and digital policy issues. data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike. however, as times change and innovation progresses at a rapid rate, it’s clear the laws protecting consumers’ data and privacy must evolve as well. “data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike.” as the global regulatory landscape shifts, there is now widespread agreement among business, government, and consumers that we must modernize our privacy laws, and create an approach to protecting consumer privacy that works in today’s data-driven reality, while still delivering the innovations consumers and businesses demand. more and more, lawmakers and stakeholders acknowledge that an effective privacy regime provides meaningful privacy protections for consumers regardless of where they live. approaches, like the framework iti released last fall, must offer an interoperable solution that can serve as a model for governments worldwide, providing an alternative to a patchwork of laws that could create confusion and uncertainty over what protections individuals have. companies are also increasingly aware of the critical role they play in protecting privacy. looking ahead, the tech industry will continue to develop mechanisms to hold us accountable, including recommendations that any privacy law mandate companies identify, monitor, and document uses of known personal data, while ensuring the existence of meaningful enforcement mechanisms. nuala o’connor nuala o’connor is president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology, a global nonprofit

technologies and services we use, the companies that provide those services, and our capacity to navigate confusing notices and settings. “americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away.” we are burdened with trying to make informed choices that align with our personal privacy preferences on hundreds of devices and thousands of apps, and reading and parsing as many different policies and settings. no individual has the time nor capacity to manage their privacy in this way, nor is it a good use of time in our increasingly busy lives. these notices and choices and checkboxes have become privacy theater, but not privacy reality. in 2019, the legal landscape for data privacy is changing, and so is the public perception of how companies handle data. as more information comes to light about the effects of companies’ data practices and myriad stewardship missteps, americans are surprised and shocked about what they’re learning. they’re increasingly paying attention, and questioning why they are still overburdened and unprotected. and with intensifying scrutiny by the media, as well as state and local lawmakers, companies are recognizing the need for a clear and nationally consistent set of rules. personal privacy is the cornerstone of the digital future people want. americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away. the center for democracy & technology wants to help craft those legal principles to solidify americans’ digital privacy rights for the first time. chris baker chris baker is senior vice president and general manager of emea at box. last year saw data privacy hit the headlines as businesses and consumers alike were forced to navigate the implementation of gdpr. but it’s far from over. “…customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed” 2019 will be the year that the rest of the world catches up to the legislative example set by europe, as similar data regulations come to the forefront. organizations must ensure they are compliant with regional data privacy regulations, and more gdpr-like policies will start to have an impact. this can present a headache when it comes to data management, especially if you’re operating internationally. however, customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed, and customers can rest assured knowing that no matter where they are in the world, businesses must meet the highest bar possible when it comes to data security. starting with the u.s., 2019 will see larger corporations opt-in to gdpr to support global business practices. at the same time, local data regulators will lift large sections of the eu legislative framework and implement these rules in their own countries. 2018 was the year of gdpr in europe, and 2019 be the year of gdpr globally. christopher wolf christopher wolf is the founder and chair of the future of privacy forum think tank, and is senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing

federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede.” with the adoption of a highly-regulatory and broadly-applicable state privacy law in california last summer (and similar laws adopted or proposed in other states), and with intense focus on the data collection and sharing practices of large tech companies, the time may have come where congress will adopt a comprehensive federal privacy law. complicating the adoption of a federal law will be the issue of preemption of state laws and what to do with the highly-developed sectoral laws like hippa and gramm-leach-bliley. also to be determined is the expansion of ftc regulatory powers. regardless of the outcome of the debate over a new federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede."
"amazon has secured some retail space in the heart of london, according to a report from the grocer spotted by reuters. this is significant, as amazon has yet to open an amazon go store outside of the u.s. there are now 10 amazon go stores in the u.s. — four in seattle, four in chicago and two in san francisco. based on this pattern, the company doesn’t want to spread itself too thin. when amazon decides on a city, the company launches multiple amazon go stores. let’s see if the same thing happens in london. amazon go stores are a bit different from your usual grocery store. when you walk into the store, you open the amazon app and scan a qr code on your phone. you can then pick up whatever you want in the store and leave. amazon has equipped its stores with a ton of cameras and sensors so that it knows what you’re buying at all times. it sounds a little creepy, but it can help you save time. it’s going to be interesting to see if privacy watchdogs in europe will let this concept fly. according to another report, the company could also be working on securing retail space in u.s. airports. amazon could open small cashier-free go stores to showcase its technology in these high-traffic areas. nobody knows for sure what amazon plans on doing next. are amazon go stores just a way to promote amazon’s brands and generate a bit of revenue, or is there a bigger goal there? the company also owns whole foods, and you can still find cashiers in whole foods stores across the u.s."
"darktrace helped pave the way for using artificial intelligence to combat malicious hacking and enterprise security breaches. now a new u.k. startup founded by an ex-darktrace executive has raised some funding to take the use of ai in cybersecurity to the next level. senseon, which has pioneered a new model that it calls “ai triangulation” — simultaneously applying artificial intelligence algorithms to oversee, monitor and defend an organization’s network appliances, endpoints and “investigator bots” covering multiple microservices — has raised $6.4 million in seed funding. david atkinson — the startup’s ceo and founder who had previously been the commercial director for darktrace and before that helped pioneer new cybersecurity techniques as an operative at the u.k.’s ministry of defense — said that senseon will use the funding to continue to expand its business both in europe and the u.s.  the deal was co-led by mmc ventures and mark weatherford, who is chief cybersecurity strategist at varmour (which itself raised money in recent weeks) and previously deputy under secretary for cybersecurity, u.s. department of homeland security. others in the round included amadeus capital partners, crane venture partners and cylon, a security startup incubator in london. as atkinson describes it, triangulation was an analytics concept first introduced by the cia in the u.s., a method of bringing together multiple vectors of information to unearth inconsistencies in a data set (you can read more on triangulation in this cia publication). he saw an opportunity to build a platform that took the same kind of approach to enterprise security. there are a number of companies that are using ai-based techniques to help defend against breaches — in addition to darktrace, there is hexadite (a remediation specialist acquired by microsoft), amazon is working in the field and many others. in fact i think you’d be hard-pressed to find any it security company today that doesn’t claim to or actually use ai in its approach. atkinson claims, however, that many ai-based solutions — and many other it security products — take siloed, single-point approaches to defending a network. that is to say, you have network appliance security products, endpoint security, perhaps security for individual microservices and so on. but while many of these work well, you don’t always get those different services speaking to each other. and that doesn’t reflect the shape that the most sophisticated security breaches are taking today. as cybersecurity breaches and identified vulnerabilities continue to grow in frequency and scope — with hundreds of millions of individuals’ and organizations’ data potentially exposed in the process, systems disabled, and more — we’re seeing an increasing amount of sophistication on the part of the attackers. yes, those malicious actors employ artificial intelligence. but — as described in this 2019 paper on the state of cybersecurity from symantec — they are also taking advantage of bigger “surface areas” with growing networks of connected objects all up for grabs; and they are tackling new frontiers like infiltrating data in transport and cloud-based systems. (in terms of examples of new frontiers, mobile networks, biometric data, gaming networks, public clouds and new card-skimming techniques are some of the specific areas that experian calls out.) senseon’s antidote has been to build a new platform that “emulates how analysts think,” said atkinson. looking at an enterprise’s network appliance, an endpoint and microservices in the cloud, the senseon platform “has an autonomous conversation” using the source data, before it presents a conclusion, threat, warning or even breach alert to the organization’s security team. “we have an ability to take observations and compare that to hypothetical scenarios. when we tell you something, it has a rich context,” he said. single-point alternatives essentially can create “blind spots that hackers manoeuvre around. relying on single-source intelligence is like tying one hand behind your back.” after senseon compiles its data, it sends out alerts to security teams in a remediation service. interestingly, while the platform’s aim is to identify malicious activity in a network, another consequence of what it’s doing is to help organizations identify “false positives” that are not actually threats, to cut down on time and money that get wasted on investigating those. “organisations of all sizes need to get better at keeping pace with emerging threats, but more importantly, identifying the attacks that require intervention,” said mina samaan of mmc ventures in a statement. “senseon’s technology directly addresses this challenge by using reinforcement learning ai techniques to help over-burdened security teams better understand anomalous behaviour through a single holistic platform.” although senseon is only announcing seed funding today, the company has actually been around since 2017 and already has customers, primarily in the finance and legal industries (it would only give out one customer reference, the law firm of harbottle & lewis)."
"perhaps hoping to distract from greenpeace’s latest report on its “dirty cloud,” amazon this morning announced a new environmental commitment, focused on reducing its carbon footprint. the company says it aims to reach 50 percent of all amazon shipments with net zero carbon by 2030. the company is calling this program “shipment zero.” details on this long-term project weren’t yet available, but amazon says it plans to share its company-wide carbon footprint “along with related goals and programs,” at a later date. that seems to indicate amazon will offer an update on the progress of its other sustainability goals, as well. it’s important for amazon to be transparent on these plans, as the size of its business means its impact to the environment, energy consumption and, ultimately climate change, is significant. the company today runs programs including frustration-free packaging and ship in own container, and has a network of solar and wind farms, solar on its fulfillment center rooftops and investments in the circular economy the company noted in the announcement. it said it employs more than 200 scientists, engineers and product designers who are dedicated to developing new ways to leverage amazon’s scale for the “good of the customers and the planet.” for example, amazon has been able to pressure suppliers to reduce their environmental impact with the frustration-free packaging and ship in own container programs. but amazon doesn’t have the cleanest environmental record, according to greenpeace. the organization dinged the internet giant only days ago for failing to deliver on its commitment to shifting to renewable energy. its new report said amazon’s data centers in virginia are powered by only 12 percent renewable energy, compared with facebook’s 37 percent and microsoft’s 34 percent. in-between the lines of this morning’s news, amazon briefly addressed the greenpeace report. “amazon has a long-term goal to power our global infrastructure using 100 percent renewable energy, and we are making solid progress,” its corporate blog post read. amazon did, however, offer a longer statement to windpower engineering shortly after the report’s publication, claiming greenpeace’s data was inaccurate. in particular, it pointed out that the report had failed to highlight aws and amazon’s investment in solar projects in virginia. amazon says it will offer more details on shipment zero and its other programs later this year."
"google is making it easier for device manufacturers to integrate with google assistant technology, including those times when devices need to respond to voice commands without the benefit — or the expense — of being connected to google’s cloud. to do so, google is today launching into preview a new set of tools called, google assistant connect, before making them broadly available to device makers later this year. the tools can be used to build devices that leverage an existing connected speaker with google assistant to deliver content and respond to commands that require cloud computing resources. google assistant connect also includes features that will make it simpler for customers to set up their new smart home devices by offering an easier way to pair with google assistant. for some examples of how this could work: a device maker could integrate an e-ink display that shows the weather or your calendar, while the assistant connect delivered content provided by the customer’s linked smart speaker to update the display with your current meetings and temperature. that allows the manufacturer’s device to benefit from an existing smart speaker’s capabilities instead of having to integrate that technology itself. this is similar to how amazon’s alexa connect kit is used with various smart devices, like the alexa microwave.  google assistant connect can also be used in rooms where a google assistant smart speaker isn’t available, to allow devices to respond to simple voice commands — like ordering an air conditioner to turn itself on or off, for instance. the simpler setup feature also rivals amazon’s newer wi-fi simple setup for alexa devices. google assistant connect will simply set up, as well, by allowing devices to connect to google home speakers without the need for a separate bridge or hub. this is an area google had somewhat ventured into back in october with the launch of google + c by ge smart led bulbs, which were made to work with google devices without a hub. now this same capability will be a part of this broader toolkit for device makers. google says it will have more to share about assistant connect later in the year, as it opens up to more manufacturers."
"hardware, as the saying goes, is hard, but today a startup has raised some money for a manufacturing platform that it believes can make the prospect of starting and running hardware businesses a little easier. fictiv, which positions itself as a kind of aws for manufacturing — providing a platform both to design components and help get them produced — has raised $33 million, money that it will use to continue expanding its production ecosystem, the range of components that it can make and to grow its customer base. the company is not disclosing its valuation, but, according to pitchbook, fictiv was valued at around $65 million post-money in its last fundraise, which could put the company at around $100 million with this latest injection. this series c was led by g2vp, with new strategic investor mitsui & co. and previous backers accel, bill gates, intel capital, sinovation and tandon group also participating. fictiv has raised $58 million to date. “injection” may be the operative word here — or at least one of them. fictiv today works across manufacturing plants in china and the bay area, covering a range of processes, including injection molding, cnc machining, 3d printing and urethane casting, covering a variety of materials. customers use the company’s cloud-based software to design and order parts, which are routed by fictiv to the plants best suited to make them. “fictiv does not own any machines, we are a cloud based network of hundreds of manufacturers both domestic and overseas. today, that is mostly centered in the us and china, but this round will enable us to strategically grow our network to add new capabilities, increase access to materials and provide customers with additional capacity. but it’s important to note that our goal is not to build the world’s largest network of manufacturers, rather it’s highest quality network,” wrote dave evans, the ceo and co-founder (with nate evans) of fictiv, in an emailed interview. current customers include the likes of sphero and facebook, which has used fictiv’s services for prototyping and creating small runs of devices (like the one pictured above). the problem that fictiv is solving has been a persistent one in the world of hardware: making prototypes can cost a lot and be very inefficient, and that’s before you move into full-scale manufacturing, which can be challenging even with economies of scale. it’s also a very crowded field, with a number of different companies all vying to help fill the role of manufacturing enabler (and it is a field also littered with failures). but over the years, we’ve seen a lot of advances in manufacturing tech, with the trade-off that some of the work it takes on freeing up staff to work on other challenges. more recently, companies have been feeling an extra squeeze by way of the trade tensions between the u.s., a key market for sales, and china, which has a strong hold on efficient and cheap manufacturing (as well as an interesting and large sales market). “the uncertainty companies feel under the threat of trade wars are forcing the industry to shine a light on the lack of investment that has been made in manufacturing technology,” evans said. “threats of tariffs and trade wars are not new, but that, along with other pressures like materials shortages, amplify the need for product companies to think about how to build responsive supply chains. today’s supply chains can take years to establish, and those time frames do not align with the speed of innovation and the responsiveness required by product companies today. designers and developers must design supply chains that are equally nimble and agile. that’s the role of fictiv.” the aws comparison that fictiv likes to use extends not only to the concept that amazon has perfected — of outsourcing expensive aspects of an operation to a third-party that can reduce the cost through economies of scale — but also to the emphasis on using cloud services to speed up certain processes. the company’s aim, evans said, is to enable designers to “create hardware at the speed of software.” evans himself was the first hire for ford’s innovation lab in silicon valley, overseeing prototyping infotainment systems in automotive dashboards. “my frustration trying to source vendors and manage supply chains — especially while i watched my software colleagues fire through new cycles at incredible speed — directly motivated me to create fictiv,” he said. the company has attracted “intense interest” from backers in part also because of this problem, he added. “investors and others realize that manufacturing — like other industries before it [such as] finance, retail, travel — is having its technology moment,” he said. “we are excited to be part of the digital transformation of the status quo in manufacturing,” said ​daniel oros​, partner at g2vp, in a statement. “fictiv’s innovative tools and services address the critical gap in contract manufacturing that will lead to a massive shift in how consumer and industrial products are manufactured.”"
"in addition to competing for smart speaker market share, google and amazon are also competing for developer mindshare in the voice app ecosystem. on this front, amazon has soared ahead — the number of available voice skills for alexa devices has grown to top 80,000 the company recently announced. according to a new third-party analysis from voicebot, google is trailing that by a wide margin with its own voice apps, called google assistant actions, which total 4,253 in the u.s. as of january 2019. for comparison, 56,750 of amazon alexa’s total 80,000 skills are offered in the u.s. the report notes that the number of google assistant actions have grown 2.5 times over the past year — which is slightly faster growth than seen on amazon alexa, whose skill count grew 2.2 times during the same period. but the total is a much smaller number, so growth percentages may not be as relevant here. in january 2018, there were 1,719 total google assistant actions in the u.s., the report said. in 2017, the number was in the low hundreds in the beginning of the year, and reached 724 by october 2017. voicebot also examined which categories of voice apps were popular on google assistant platforms. it found that three of the 18 categories accounted for more than one-third of all google assistant actions: education & reference; games & fun; and kids & family. the education category topped the list with more than 15 percent of all actions, while games & fun was 11.07 percent and kids & family was 9.29 percent. local and weather were the least popular. on alexa, the top categories differ slightly. though games & fun is popular on google, its alexa equivalent — games & trivia — is the no. 1 most popular category, accounting for 21 percent of all skills. education was second most popular at around 14 percent. it’s interesting that these two top drivers for voice apps are reversed on the two platforms. that could indicate that alexa is seen to be the more “fun” platform, or one that’s more oriented toward use by families and gaming. amazon certainly became aware of the trend toward voice gaming, and fanned the flames by making games the first category it paid developers to work on by way of direct payments. that likely encouraged more developers to enter the space, and subsequently helped boost the number of games — and types of gaming experiences — available for alexa. voicebot’s report rightly raises the question as to whether or not the raw skill count even matters, though. after all, many of the alexa skills offered today are of low quality, or more experimental attempts from developers testing out the platform. others are just fairly basic — the voice app equivalent of third-party flashlight apps for iphone before apple built that feature into ios. for example, there now are a handful of skills that turn on the light on echo speakers so you can have a nightlight by way of the speaker’s blue ring. but even if these early efforts sometimes fall short, it does matter that alexa is the platform developers are thinking about, as it’s an indication of platform commitment and an investment on developers’ part. google, on the other hand, is powering a lot of its assistant’s capabilities itself, leaning heavily on its knowledge base to answer users’ questions, while also leveraging its ability to integrate with google’s larger suite of apps and services, as well as its other platforms, like android. in time, google assistant may challenge alexa further by capitalizing on geographic expansions, but for the time being, alexa is ahead on smart speakers as well as, it now seems, on content."
"siri, alexa, google assistant, cortana and bixby — almost all virtual assistants have something in common. their default voices are women’s, though the role that plays in reinforcing gender stereotypes has been long documented, even inspiring the dystopian romance “her.” virtue, the creative agency owned by publisher vice, wants to challenge the trend with a genderless voice called q. the project, done in collaboration with copenhagen pride, equal ai, koalition interactive and thirtysoundsgood, wants technology companies to think outside the binary. “technology companies are continuing to gender their voice technology to fit scenarios in which they believe consumers will feel most comfortable adopting and using it,” says q’s website. “a male voice is used in more authoritative roles, such as banking and insurance apps, and a female voice in more service-oriented roles, such as alexa and siri.” to develop q, virtue worked with anna jørgensen, a linguist and researcher at the university of copenhagen. they recorded the voices of five non-binary people, then used software to modulate the recordings to between 145-175 hz, the range defined by researchers as gender neutral. the recordings were further refined after surveying 4,600 people and asking them to define the voices on a scale from 1 (male) to 5 (female). virtue is encouraging people to share q with apple, amazon and microsoft, noting that even when different options are given for voice assistants, they are still usually categorized as male or female. as the project’s mission statement puts it, “as society continues to break down the gender binary, recognizing those who neither identify as male nor female, the technology we create should follow.”"
"following amazon’s decision to set up one of its new headquarters in long island city, queens, the company announced this morning a plan to fund computer science classes in more than 130 new york city area high schools. specifically, amazon will fund both introductory and advanced placement (ap) classes across all five nyc boroughs, including more than 30 schools in queens, near its new headquarters. the courses will be supported by the amazon future engineer program, whose stated goal is to bring more than 10 million kids to computer science per year, and fund computer science courses for over 100,000 underprivileged kids in 2,000 low-income high schools in the u.s. it also awards 100 students per year with four-year $10,000 scholarships and offers internships at amazon. the funding for the new york area schools will cover preparatory lessons, tutorials and professional development for teachers, says amazon, as well as offer sequenced and paced digital curriculum for students, and live online support for both teachers and students. all participating students will also receive a free membership to aws educate, which offers free computing power in the aws cloud for coding projects. it’s no surprise that nyc areas schools would be next on the list of areas to fund by way of amazon’s future engineer program, given amazon’s need to grow its base and a developer funnel for new tech talent in the nyc area. however, the move also drives home how disappointing amazon’s “hq2” decision has been for those areas that lost out when the retail giant opted to split its “second” headquarters between queens and arlington, va. there are cities across the u.s. that would have benefited more from amazon’s ability to fund computer science courses in their school systems. instead, amazon is pouring more money into an area that already has a lot of tech talent. amazon isn’t exactly being welcomed in nyc, anyway, as its arrival will drive up rents, displace plans for affordable housing, impact small business and crowd already overcrowded public transportation, along with other issues. amazon says it will be working with new york-area curriculum provider edhesive to bring the courses to the schools. a full list of the schools that will receive the classes is here."
"many things are better said than read, but the best voice tech out there seems to be reserved for virtual assistants, not screen readers or automatically generated audiobooks. wellsaid wants to enable any creator to use quality synthetic speech instead of a human voice — perhaps even a synthetic version of themselves. there’s been a series of major advances in voice synthesis over the last couple of years as neural network technology improves on the old highly manual approach. but google, apple and amazon seem unwilling to make their great voice tech available for anything but chirps from your phone or home hub. as soon as i heard about wavenet, and later tacotron, i tried to contact the team at google to ask when they’d get to work producing natural-sounding audiobooks for everything on google books, or as a part of amp, or make it an accessibility service, and so on. never heard back. i considered this a lost opportunity, as there are many out there who need such a service. so i was pleased to hear that wellsaid is taking on this market, after a fashion, anyway. the company is the first to launch from the allen institute for ai (ai2) incubator program announced back in 2017. they do take their time! allen-backed ai2 incubator aims to connect ai startups with world-class talent talk the talk i talked with the co-founders ceo matt hocking and cto michael petrochuk, who explained why they went about creating a whole new system for voice synthesis. the basic problem, they said, is that existing systems not only rely on a lot of human annotation to sound right, but they “sound right” the exact same way every time. you can’t just feed it a few hours of audio and hope it figures out how to inflect questions or pause between list items — much of this stuff has to be spelled out for them. the end result, however, is highly efficient. “their goal is to make a small model for cheap [i.e. computationally] that pronounces things the same way every time. it’s this one perfect voice,” said petrochuk. “we took research like tacotron and pushed it even further — but we’re not trying to control speech and enforce this arbitrary structure on it.” “when you think about the human voice, what makes it natural, kind of, is the inconsistencies,” said hocking. and where better to find inconsistencies than in humans? the team worked with a handful of voice actors to record dozens of hours of audio to feed to the system. there’s no need to annotate the text with “speech markup language” to designate parts of sentences and so on, petrochuk said: “we discovered how to train off of raw audiobook data, without having to do anything on top of that.” so wellsaid’s model will often pronounce the same word differently, not because a carefully manicured manual model of language suggested it do so, but because the person whose vocal fingerprint it is imitating did so. and how does that work, exactly? that question seems to dip into wellsaid’s secret sauce. their model, like any deep learning system, is taking innumerable inputs into account and producing an output, but it is larger and more far-reaching than other voice synthesis systems. things like cadence and pronunciation aren’t specified by its overseers but extracted from the audio and modeled in real time. sounds a bit like magic, but that’s often the case when it comes to bleeding-edge ai research. it runs on a cpu in real time, not on a gpu cluster somewhere, so it can be done offline as well. this is a feat in itself, as many voice synthesis algorithms are quite resource-heavy. what matters is that the voice produced can speak any text in a very natural-sounding way. here’s the first bit of an article — alas, not one of mine, which would have employed more mellifluous circumlocutions — read by google’s wavenet, then by two of wellsaid’s voices. the latter two are definitely more natural sounding than the first. on some phrases the voices may be nearly indistinguishable from their originals, but in most cases i feel sure i could pick out the synthetic voice in a few words. that it’s even close, however, is an accomplishment. and i can certainly say that if i was going to have an article read to my by one of these voices, it would be wellsaid’s. naturally it can also be tweaked and iterated, or effects applied to further manipulate the sound, as with any voice performance. you didn’t think those interviews you hear on npr are unedited, did you? the goal at first is to find the creatives whose work would be improved or eased by adding this tool to their toolbox. “there are a lot of people who have this need,” explained hocking. “a video producer who doesn’t have the budget to hire a voice actor; someone with a large volume of content that has to be iterated on rapidly; if english is a second language, this opens up a lot of doors; and some people just don’t have a voice for radio.” it would be nice to be able to add voice with a click rather than just have block text and royalty-free music over a social ad (think the admen): i asked about the reception among voice actors, who of course are essentially being asked to train their own replacements. they said that the actors were actually positive about it, thinking of it as something like stock photography for voice; get a premade product for cheap, and if you like it, pay the creator for the real thing. although they didn’t want to prematurely lock themselves into future business models, they did acknowledge that revenue share with voice actors was a possibility. payment for virtual representations is something of a new and evolving field. a closed beta launches today, which you can sign up for at the company’s site. they’re going to be launching with five voices to start, with more voices and options to come as wellsaid’s place in the market becomes clear. part of that process will almost certainly be inclusion in tools used by the blind or otherwise disabled, as i have been hoping for years. sounds familiar and what comes after that? making synthetic versions of users’ voices, of course. no brainer! but the two founders cautioned that’s a ways off for several reasons, even though it’s very much a possibility. “right now we’re using about 20 hours of data per person, but we see a future where we can get it down to one or two hours while maintaining a premium lifelike quality to the voice,” said petrochuk. “and we can build off existing data sets, like where someone has a back catalog of content,” added hocking. the trouble is that the content may not be exactly right for training the deep learning model, which advanced as it is can no doubt be finicky. there are dials and knobs to tweak, of course, but they said that fine-tuning a voice is more a matter of adding corrective speech, perhaps having the voice actor reading a specific script that props up the sounds or cadences that need a boost. they compared it with directing such an actor rather than adjusting code. you don’t, after all, tell an actor to increase the pauses after commas by 8 percent or 15 milliseconds, whichever is longer. it’s more efficient to demonstrate for them: “say it like this.” even so, getting the quality just right with limited and imperfect training data is a challenge that will take some serious work if and when the team decides to take it on. but as some of you may have noticed, there are also some parallels to the unsavory world of “deepfakes.” download a dozen podcasts or speeches and you’ve got enough material to make a passable replica of someone’s voice, perhaps a public figure. this of course has a worrying synergy with the existing ability to fake video and other imagery. this is not news to hocking and petrochuk. if you work in ai, this kind of thing is sort of inevitable. “this is a super important question and we’ve considered it a lot,” said petrochuk. “we come from ai2, where the motto is ‘ai for the common good.’ that’s something we really subscribe to, and that differentiates us from our competitors who made barack obama voices before they even had an mvp [minimum viable product]. we’re going to watch closely to make sure this isn’t being used negatively, and we’re not launching with the ability to make a custom voice, because that would let anyone create a voice from anyone.” active monitoring is just about all anyone with a potentially troubling ai technology can be expected to do — though they are looking at mitigation techniques that could help identify synthetic voices. with the ongoing emphasis on multimedia presentation of content and advertising rather than written, wellsaid seems poised to make an early play in a growing market. as the product evolves and improves, it’s easy to picture it moving into new, more constrained spaces, like time-shifting apps (instant podcast with five voices to choose from!) and even taking over territory currently claimed by voice assistants. sounds good to me."
"amazon has confirmed it has retired physical stick-on dash buttons from sale — in favor of virtual alternatives that let prime members tap a digital button to reorder a staple product. it also points to its dash replenishment service — which offers an api for device makers wanting to build internet-connected appliances that can automatically reorder the products they need to function, be it cat food, batteries or washing power — as another reason why physical dash buttons, which launched back in 2015 (costing $5 a pop), are past their sell-by date. amazon says “hundreds” of iot devices capable of self-ordering on amazon have been launched globally to date by brands including beko, epson, illy, samsung and whirlpool, to name a few. so why press a physical button when a digital one will do? or, indeed, why not do away with the need to push a button all and just let your gadgets rack up your grocery bill all by themselves while you get on with the importance business of consuming all the stuff they’re ordering? you can see where amazon wants to get to with its “so customers don’t have to think at all about restocking” line. consumption that entirely removes the consumer’s decision-making process from the transactional loop is quite the capitalist wet dream. though the company does need to be careful about consumer protection rules as it seeks to excise friction from the buying process. the e-commerce behemoth also claims customers are “increasingly” using its alexa voice assistant to reorder staples, such as via the alexa shopping voice shopping app (amazon calls it “hands-free shopping”) that lets people inform the machine about a purchase intent and it will suggest items to buy based on their amazon order history. albeit, it offers no actual usage metrics for alexa shopping. so that’s meaningless pr. a less flashy but perhaps more popular option than “hands-free shopping,” which amazon also says has contributed to making physical dash buttons redundant, is its subscribe & save program. this “lets customers automatically receive their favorite items every month,” as amazon puts it. it offers an added incentive of discounts that kick in if the user signs up to buy five or more products per month. but the mainstay of the sales pitch is convenience with amazon touting time saved by subscribing to “essentials” — and time saved from compiling boring shopping lists once again means more time to consume the stuff being bought on amazon… in a statement about retiring physical dash buttons from global sale on february 28, amazon also confirmed it will continue to support existing dash owners — presumably until their buttons wear down to the bare circuit board from repeat use. “existing dash button customers can continue to use their dash button devices,” it writes. “we look forward to continuing support for our customers’ shopping needs, including growing our dash replenishment product line-up and expanding availability of virtual dash buttons.” so farewell then clunky dash buttons. another physical push-button bites the dust. though plastic-y dash buttons were quite unlike the classic iphone home button — always seeming temporary and experimental rather than slick and coolly reassuring. even so, the end of both buttons points to the need for tech businesses to tool up for the next wave of contextually savvy connected devices. more smarts, and more controllable smarts is key. amazon’s statement about “shifting focus” for dash does not mention potential legal risks around the buttons related to consumer rights challenges — but that’s another angle here. in january a court in germany ruled dash buttons breached local e-commerce rules, following a challenge by a regional consumer watchdog that raised concerns about t&cs that allow amazon to substitute a product of a higher price or even a different product entirely than what the consumer had originally selected. the watchdog argued consumers should be provided with more information about price and product before taking the order — and the judges agreed — though amazon said it would seek to appeal. while it’s not clear whether or not that legal challenge contributed to amazon’s decision to shutter dash, it’s clear that virtual dash buttons offer more opportunities for displaying additional information prior to a purchase than a screen-less physical dash button. they also are more easily adaptable to any tightening legal requirements across different markets. the demise of the physical dash was reported earlier by cnet."
"pandora today announced the launch of its own, in-app voice assistant that you can call up at any time by saying “hey pandora,” followed by a request to play the music or podcasts you want to hear. the feature will allow you to not only control music playback with commands to play a specific artist, album, radio or playlist, but will also be capable of delivering results customized to you when responding to vague commands or those related to activity or mood. for example, you’ll get personalized results for requests like “play something new,” “play more like this,” “play music for relaxing,” “play workout music,” “play something i like” and others. the company reports strong adoption of its service on voice-activated speakers, like amazon echo devices, where now millions of listeners launch pandora music by speaking — a trend that inspired the move to launch in-app voice control. “voice is just an expected new way that you engage with any app,” notes pandora chief product officer chris phillips. “on the mobile app, we’re doing more than just your typical request against the catalog… asking: ‘hey, pandora,’ to search and play or pause or skip,” he says. “what we’re doing that we think is pretty special is we’re taking that voice utterance of what someone asks for, and we’re applying our personalized recommendations to the response,” phillips explains. that means when you ask pandora to play you something new, the app will return a selection that won’t resemble everyone else’s music, but will rather be informed by your own listening habits and personal tastes. the way that result is returned may also vary — for some, it could be a playlist, for others an album and for others, it could be just a new song, a personalized soundtrack or a radio station. “play something new” isn’t the only command that will yield a personalized response, pandora says. it will also return personalized results for commands related to your mood or activity — like workout music, something to relax to, music for cooking and more. for podcasts, it can dig up episodes with a specific guest, play shows by title, or even deliver show recommendations, among other things. voice commands can be used in lieu of pressing buttons, too, in order to do things like add songs to a playlist or giving a song you like a thumbs up, for instance. the new feature, called “voice mode,” taps into pandora’s machine learning and data science capabilities, which is an active battleground between music services. spotify, for example, is well known for its deep personalization with its discover weekly and other custom playlists, like its daily mixes. but its own “voice mode” option is only available for its premium users, according to a faq on the company’s website. pandora, meanwhile, is planning to roll out voice mode to all users — both free and paid. for free users, the feature will work in conjunction with an existing ad product that allows users to opt in to watch a video in order to gain temporary access to pandora’s on-demand service. while this option is not live at launch, the plan is to allow any user to use the “hey pandora” command, then redirect free users with a request to play music on demand to instead play the opt-in ad first. pandora voice mode will launch today, january 15, to a percentage of the ios and android user base — around a million listeners. the company will track the speed, accuracy and performance of its results before rolling it out more broadly over the next couple of months. users with a google home device can also cast from their pandora app to their smart speaker, and a similar feature will arrive on alexa devices soon, the company believes. pandora works with siri shortcuts, too. that means you can now use voice to launch the app itself, then play a personalized selection of music without having to touch your phone at all. voice mode will be available in the pandora app via the search bar next to the magnifying glass."
"the 2019 edition of a popular annual survey shows usage of social media by americans is stalling while ownership of smart speakers and tablets has soared over the last year, as has consumer engagement with podcasts. the results are promising for amazon and spotify in particular. earlier today, edison research and triton digital presented their infinite dial report with findings from a phone survey of 1,500 americans (age 12+) during january and february. since 1998, the report has tracked the adoption of mobile devices, social media services, and online audio. here are my key takeaways from it: 1. social media: consistent with the trend from last year, the market for social media users appears to be saturated. the percent of americans who say they have ever used social media is 79%, up from 78% last year but down from the 80% peak in 2017. among facebook, instagram, pinterest, snapchat, linkedin, and twitter, only instagram saw an increase in the percent of the population who say they use it (39% compared to 36% in 2018). facebook lost roughly 15 million users since 2017 based on this survey data. while the majority of people age 55+ now say they use facebook, that doesn’t make up for the drop in usage among those age 12-34 from 79% in 2017 to 67% in 2018 to 62% now. pinterest, which recently filed to go public, also appears to be losing popularity among that key demographic. now only 31% of americans in the 12-34 age group say they use the social pinning platform, compared to 36% last year, and only 1% say pinterest is their most used social app (compared to 3% in 2015). in this context, potential competition from instagram looks especially threatening. 2. smart speakers: 23% of americans now own a smart speaker, with 16% of them owning an amazon alexa device (that’s more than twice the percent who own a google home device). just two years ago, only 7% reported owning a smart speaker. the percent of those owners who have 3 or more devices has more than doubled from 11% last year to 26% this year as well. many consumers are crossing a threshold from testing these speakers to making them a ubiquitous presence throughout their home. 3. tablets: while ownership of smartphones is flat, there was a 12% year-over-year increase in the population of tablet owners from 50% of the population to 56%. according to triton president john rosso’s commentary, amazon’s fire tablet led the pack with 23% year-over-year growth. 4. online audio: 24% of respondents said they used spotify and 12% said they used amazon music in the last month. that compares to 20% and 9%, respectively, last year and places amazon music on equal footing with apple music. 5. podcasts: 32% of americans are monthly podcast listeners compared to 26% in 2018, representing the largest year-over-year growth in that statistic since infinite dial began. the format saw a 33% surge in popularity among young people (age 12-24) from 30% listening monthly to 40% doing so. a full 22% of americans are weekly podcast listeners and those people consume an average of seven episodes per week. also, in a notable symbolic shift, the majority (51%) of americans now say they have listened to a podcast at least once. amazon’s gains: the explosion in smart speaker ownership is disproportionately benefiting amazon with its alexa devices and the same scenario is occurring in tablets with the amazon fire. the company is the most immediate winner in the growth of these markets. moreover, people who own a smart speaker are dramatically more likely to use amazon music as their primary music streaming service (16% vs. 9% for the general population of people who have used online audio). this could be a mere correlation that amazon music has an older demographic (according to this data, it does) and smart speakers are bought by an older demographic; on the other hand, it may suggest causation that people who buy smart speakers often adopt the default amazon music streaming service. if the latter is true to a substantial degree, it suggests amazon music’s momentum against apple music (and other streaming services) is likely to only pick up. spotify’s podcast push is working: spotify is making a big play into podcasting. its market share is growing substantially, it surpassed apple’s podcast app in popularity in several countries, and just announced a major commitment to the format that included acquiring anchor and gimlet. according to the infinite dial survey, the percent of spotify users aged 12-24 who listen to podcasts monthly jumped from 32% last year to 54% this year. that’s 69% year-over-year growth. this shows spotify’s users are buying into its new promotion of podcast content. it also lends credibility to the argument that spotify is expanding the market of podcast listeners, not just poaching users from other podcast apps. as i argued in my analysis about the entry of music streaming services and hollywood into podcasting, spotify has the ability to rapidly ingrain podcast listening among its 207 million monthly active users and to make premium (subscriber-only) podcasts mainstream by bundling them into a music subscription that 96 million people already pay for. you can review the the full infinite dial deck here."
"at mwc barcelona, google today made a few announcements around its assistant. a lot of these center around support for kaios, the operating system for low-end feature phones that google invested in last year, and additional language support. while kaios, which was born out of mozilla’s failed firefoxos project, may be for the very low end of low-end phones, google argues that it’s exactly these devices that can profit from have access to a voice-driven assistant, given that they often have smaller screens, too, that make typing a hassle. google is now bringing the assistant to these kaios devices for users in india, indonesia, mexico and brazil. in addition, it’s also bringing voice typing to kaios to help user enter text using their voice. with this, kaios users can simply speak their queries and use the assistant as a way to input all kinds of information. “if you look at the emerging markets, we’ve seen that the number of assistant users has multiplied by seven,” google’s behshad behzadi said. “the main reason for this is that for the new users which are coming to this technology for the first time, voice is really the easiest and most natural way for them to use their phones. it’s removing a technology barrier for these users.” with today’s launch, google is also bringing support for its bilingual assistant to more languages. this allows you to seamlessly switch between two languages. until now, this only worked for english, spanish, german, french, japanese and italian. today, the company is adding korean, hindi, swedish, norwegian, danish and dutch to this lineup. in addition, the assistant now speaks eight new indic languages: marathi, bengali, tamil, telugu, gujarati, kannada, malayalam and urdu. besides the new languages, google is also bringing actions — google’s version of what amazon calls skills in the alex ecosystem — to android go and kaios. developers can build these actions in 19 languages across 29 locales now. google also quietly launched a few other new assistant features today. you can now check in to your lufthansa, swiss or austrian air flights within europe using your voice, for example. the assistant on your phone can now also control the digital wellbeing settings like your wind-down time and ‘do not disturb’ mode (in english, german and french). and if you speak german or french, then multiple actions — which allow you to tell the assistant to perform more than one action at a time (“what’s the weather like in munich and bordeaux?”) — are now available to you, too. until now, this feature was only available in english. kaios, now with 85m feature phones shipped, doubles down with google, carrier deals and more"
"in august 2018, spotify became samsung’s go-to streaming music service provider following a strategic partnership between the two companies that initially focused on bringing spotify to samsung smart tvs and a deeper connection with samsung’s assistant technology, bixby. today, timed alongside the retail launch of samsung’s galaxy s10, the companies are expanding their partnership to make spotify a pre-installed application on a range of samsung devices, including the new galaxy s10, s10+, s10e and s10 5g, as well as the galaxy fold and some of samsung’s lower mid-range galaxy a devices. in addition, u.s. consumers buying the new galaxy s10 will qualify for six months of free spotify premium access if they’re new customers, spotify said. the two companies had not offered many more details about their partnership plans since the announcement last year, saying only that a lot of discussions were taking place as to what’s next. however, a move to pre-install spotify on samsung phones was likely under consideration from day one — especially after the 2016 failure of samsung’s own milk music streaming service, which meant it no longer had its own direct answer to apple music. at the time of milk music’s closure, samsung said it would shift to investing in a partner model for integrating the “best” music services onto its galaxy family of devices. picking spotify as a key strategic partner made sense, as it’s a clear frontrunner in the space and one that’s not operated by a tech giant like google’s youtube music/google play music, apple music or amazon music. (however, samsung and youtube also announced a joint deal today where samsung galaxy s10 owners get 4 free months of ad-free youtube and youtube music.) the spotify-samsung partnership not only means that spotify now gets deeper integration on devices and services, like bixby, it could potentially allow the two companies to work together on under the hood, cross-platform integrations, as well. this could benefit spotify’s ambitious podcasting plans, as listeners could pick up where they left off as they switch between devices. that wouldn’t have necessarily been possible without a device partnership like this. spotify says the expanded samsung partnership will see the music service pre-installed on “millions” of samsung devices worldwide, starting today, march 8, 2019. “we were very excited to be named samsung’s go-to music streaming service several months ago and today’s news will only ensure a more seamless spotify listening experience across devices for listeners around the world,” said sten garmark, vp of consumer products, spotify, in a statement. “this partnership makes it easy for samsung mobile users to access their favorite music and podcasts on spotify, wherever they are and however they choose to listen.”"
"this light makes the smart home even more accessible. installed as any other ceiling downlight, the juno ai downlight features amazon alexa through integrated jbl speakers. there’s a light in there, too. the idea is great: make the smart home invisible. instead of having an amazon echo sitting on a table, this device sits in a person’s ceiling doing the job of a normal light. but when called upon, it can play music, control devices or anything else possible with an echo. “this integration of technologies easily and affordably converts any house into a functional, seamless smart home,” says jeff spencer, acuity brands lighting vice president and general manager, residential, in a released statement. “being located in the ceiling creates a unique advantage enabling juno ai to deliver not only intelligence through simple voice commands, but also exceptional lighting and sound.” devices like this will continue to appear as amazon and google expand their reach by working with more developers and hardware makers. at this point, both companies are seemingly more interested in licensing their services than selling their own devices."
"when we first wrote about hooch, it offered a fun, straightforward deal — for $9.99 per month, you could claim one free drink per day from participating bars and restaurants. since then, the company launched hooch black, a pricier subscription that includes perks like hotel discounts and concierge service. but even then, co-founder and ceo lin dai was hinting at plans to use blockchain technology to create what he called “a decentralized model for consumer rewards.” now hooch is delivering on what dai promised, with a relaunched app that rewards users for their purchases. “we were super excited about the feedback and response [to hooch black] that we saw from our members,” dai said. “what we decided to do is just completely update the app with rewards for consumers across four different categories — travel, dining, entertainment and e-commerce.” he noted that while most loyalty programs reward you for using a specific card or for shopping with a specific company, hooch has partnered with more than 250,000 merchants (including marriott hotels, tao restaurants, starbucks, uber and amazon). the company can actually scan the purchases made on any linked debit or credit card, and you’ll be rewarded whenever you spend money with those partners. the rewards take the form of what hooch is calling tap rewards dollars — the exact reward will vary depending on the merchant, but the company says it could be as high as 10 percent of your spending. lin dai, ceo of hooch dai said tap dollars are actually a stablecoin pegged to the u.s. dollar, but he emphasized that you don’t need to understand the backend to use the rewards. for most users, tap dollars will simply be a digital currency they can redeem for hotel bookings, restaurants credits and gift cards. “security is our top concern,” dai added. the idea is to access your transaction history to verify your purchases (hooch makes money by driving purchases for merchants), but without storing or sharing identifying information. “when we capture the consumer purchase information, we actually don’t capture any of their names or credit card numbers … we don’t store any identity.” the program also comes with a big perk for enlisting your friends. there is an upfront reward of five tap dollars, but the real selling point is the fact that you’ll get 20 percent of their rewards — not just on their initial purchases, but for the entire time they use the app. if you like the hooch black plan, you’ll still be able to sign up and pay for it. but the company’s emphasis has shifted to the broader rewards program, which you can join for free. drink-a-day startup hooch adds a perk-filled premium membership plan"
"rakuten tv, the japanese e-commerce giant’s effort to take on netflix and amazon in the world of video streaming, has been a minor player when it comes to market share for online entertainment, with a mere 7 million users of its service. but today, it’s unveiling two key pieces of news that it hopes will help reverse that. the company is adding 30 new countries in europe where the service will operate, bringing the total across the region and japan to 42. and it has inked a deal with big names in connected tv entertainment systems — specifically samsung, lg, philips and hisense — to embed a dedicated “rakuten tv” button on their remotes. the two moves together underscore how rakuten may not have been among those riding the wave as video streaming has exploded in popularity — compare its 7 million users with the 139 million users netflix reported in its most recent earnings — but it does not seem ready to throw in the towel on it, either. “we are here to continue running the marathon,” jacinto roca, the ceo of rakuten tv, said in an interview this week. “this is another step for us to become a global player in this industry.” it’s about time that netflix and amazon had some competition in the over-the-top video market — that is, video entertainment delivered to consumers over their existing broadband connections to compete with costly cable or satellite packages — but if they are perhaps some of the most obvious competition, they’re not the only ones. apple, google, a number of content owners themselves and device makers all believe they have a shot at muscling in and becoming the go-to destination for consumers’ video entertainment needs. rakuten tv in some ways looks directly like the japanese e-commerce company’s answer to amazon’s video service: both have moved into the area as a natural extension of their e-commerce businesses, which sell consumer electronics and already have extensive operations around content — namely books and e-books, and both would have already built a lot of the infrastructure needed to run these services as a by-product of those e-commerce operations. and, alongside other rakuten-owned assets like viber and ebates, this is one more move by the company to diversify not just its revenues and services, but the ecosystem in which customers are interacting with its brand. but rakuten tv has taken a different approach in at least three important ways. the first of these is in how it prices the service. there are no monthly subscriptions, and people watch and pay for movies on an à la carte basis. roca said that this is unlikely to change anytime in the future.  “we think that the simplicity of our offer is one of the key value propositions for us, so we have no plans to introduce monthly bundles,” he said. he added that in the case of rakuten tv, the company has found that customers watch more than one movie per month, and when you look at the average prices of its films — promotions might come in (in the u.k.) at 99 pence for one film, but a top release like the crimes of grindlewald costs £13.99 to view — “that is definitely a healthy arpu for us,” he said. “the focus today is making sure that we have people enjoying at least one movie per month on our platform.” he notes that the economics are ironically trickier in bundles for popular providers where multiple views are happening under one price, which can impact the margins on the overall service. (something that has been argued with music streaming, too.) the second area where rakuten tv is trying to stand apart from others in the streaming video space is its decision not to create original content, or at least not on any scale. the company last year put out a film that it produced, hurricane, which roca described to me as an “experiment.” “we will do three or four more films this year, to start learning about production, but we have no big strategy behind this right now,” he said, noting that content providers have some regulatory requirements in europe to also contribute investment to grow the content-production industry locally in the face of over-domination from the u.s. “it’s more an experiment, with but no strategic initiative.” content efforts can run into the hundreds of millions or even billions in terms of investment, as they collectively have for rakuten tv’s competitors, and while there is clearly some glory and cred that comes with that, for a smaller player it may not be a tenable option, given the challenges of distribution. it also puts rakuten into a better bargaining position with other content rightsholders, who will not eye it as a rival for eyeballs who might also use their own might as a bargaining chip when agreeing on licensing. that brings us to the third area where rakuten is trying to be a bit different, and one excuse of roca’s for why the company has taken so long to expand to more countries: localization. he says that rakuten tv will stand out from the field by offering a wider and better selection of content for each local market, using data to see not just what locals like to watch on tv, but what were popular cinematic releases that rakuten should definitely try to get for those markets. this takes time, he said. i have to admit there is something to this: if you have ever traveled to various far-flung places and attempted to watch netflix or amazon prime video, you might notice that not only do you get a much more limited choice of titles, but they are nearly the same from country to country and put a heavy emphasis on the services’ original content — likely one other reason why they have created it in the first place, to populate their services without having to do lots of tricky licensing deals. in any case, rakuten is putting investment in another, more basic area first before it can start to double down more on original content. the company is not disclosing how much it had to pay the smart tv makers to create a button on their remotes, but said that it made the investment based on strong results on existing handsets from roku and hisense. “we’ve had buttons on those for a couple of years, and we can see that we are bringing in new users from those buttons,” roca said. “so after two years with those, we decided it was the right moment to invest and go into brands that have big market shares in europe.” he says this will give rakuten tv potentially access to buttons on tvs from providers that collectively have a 75 percent market share in the region. of course, getting people handsets with those rakuten buttons is predicated on consumers actually buying new tvs, so this is a bet that very much has yet to pay off. the investment in smart tv placement is notable also because at the same time, rakuten is not expanding its presence in any notable way on mobile. that also is down to data, roca said: today, some 60 percent of its content is consumed on smart tvs. the company also touts that it has the largest catalog of 4k hdr movies in europe and is about to start trialing 8k. looking forward, roca said that rakuten tv’s plan is to enter completely different markets now that it has largely covered europe. that will include, most likely, latin america, which has a cultural and linguistic synergy with spain, the home market of rakuten tv (the japanese giant spearheaded its tv strategy around its 2012 acquisition of wuaki.tv, founded by roca, which it eventually rebranded). and it is also looking at which markets it might target in asia. another rakuten acquisition, of viki, which provides crowdsourced subtitles for online videos, could play a key part of its strategy in asia, where viki has a large usage base."
"is it happening? is it not happening? after years of back and forth, it looks like the new tax on tech giants in france is about to become a law. big tech companies that generate significant revenue in france will be taxed on their revenue generated in france. economy minister bruno le maire has been lobbying for a new tax so that tech giants would stop optimizing their european corporate structure to lower their effective tax rate. originally, le maire wanted to convince other european countries to get on board. but you need a unanimous vote when it comes to tax reforms in europe. and le maire couldn’t convince everyone. le maire still wanted to do something. so here we are, with a new tax on tech companies that generate more than €750 million in revenue globally and €25 million in france. if you’re operating a marketplace (amazon’s marketplace, uber, airbnb…) or an advertising business (facebook, google, criteo…), you will have to pay 3 percent of your french revenue in taxes. the government says that it isn’t against american companies, as european and asian companies are also about to get taxed. it’s a weird taxation model as it is based on revenue and not profit. it’ll also require some work from the taxation administration, as french revenue means that it involves all transactions with somebody with a french mailing address or a french ip address. france expects to generate €400 million in revenue with this new tax in 2019. i’ve been talking about this new tax with people in the french tech ecosystem and they think it’s a publicity stunt more than anything else. the oecd has been working on a way to properly tax tech companies with a standardized set of rules. it could still take a couple of years, but it would be based on profit and it would clarify the situation across dozens of countries. it would replace today’s new tax. don’t get me wrong. taxing tech giants is important and tech companies have been fined for tax avoidance for too many years. but this feels a bit rushed. apple has finished paying $15 billion european fine amazon settles tax optimization dispute with french authorities google is preparing to pay a huge fine for tax noncompliance in france"
"continuing its quest to become the amazon web services for biomanufacturing, ginkgo bioworks has launched a new spinoff called motif ingredients with $90 million in funding to develop proteins that can serve as meat and dairy replacements. it’s the second spinout for ginkgo since late 2017 when the company partnered with bayer to launch joyn bio, a startup researching and developing bacteria that could improve crop yields. now, with motif, ginkgo is tackling the wild world of protein replacements for the food and beverage industry through the spinoff of motif ingredients. it’s a move that’s likely going to send shockwaves through several of the alternative meat and dairy companies that were using ginkgo as their manufacturing partner in their quest to reduce the demand for animal husbandry — a leading contributor to global warming — through the development of protein replacements. “to help feed the world and meet consumers’ evolving food preferences, traditional and complementary nutritional sources need to co-exist. as a global dairy nutrition company, we see plant- and fermentation-produced nutrition as complementary to animal protein, and in particular cows’ milk,” said judith swales, the chief operating officer, for the global consumer and foodservice business, of fonterra, an investor in ginkgo’s new spinout. to ensure the success of its new endeavor ginkgo has raised $90 million in financing from industry insiders like fonterra and the global food processing and trading firm louis dreyfus co., while also tapping the pool of deep-pocketed investors behind breakthrough energy ventures, the climate focused investment fund financed by a global gaggle of billionaires including marc benioff, jeff bezos, michael bloomberg, richard branson, bill gates, reid hoffman, john doerr, vinod khosla, jack ma, neil shen, masayoshi son, and meg whitman. leading ginkgo’s latest spinout is a longtime veteran of the food and beverage industry, jonathan mcintyre, the former head of research and development at another biotechnology startup focused on agriculture — indigo ag. mcintyre, who left indigo just two years after being named the company’s head of research and development, previously had stints at monsanto, nutrasweet, and pepsico (in both its beverage and snack divisions). “there’s an opportunity to produce proteins,” says mcintyre. “right now as population grows the protein supply is going to be challenged. motif gives the ability to create proteins and make products from low cost available genetic material.” photo: paylessimages/istock ginkgo, which will have a minority stake in the new company, will provide engineering and design work to motif and provide some initial research and development work on roughly six to nine product lines. that push, with the financing, and ginkgo’s backing as the manufacturer of new proteins for motif ingredients should put the company in a comfortable position to achieve mcintyre’s goals of bringing his company’s first products into the market within the next two years. all motif has to pay is cost plus slight overhead for the ginkgo ingredients. “we started putting motif together around february or march of 2018,” says jason kakoyiannis*, a business development employee at ginkgo and a director of motif, of the company’s plans. “the germination of the business had its inception earlier though, from interacting with companies in the food and beverage scene. when we talked to these companies the strong sense we got was if there had been a trusted provider of outsourced protein development they would have loved to work with us.” the demand from consumers for alternative sources of protein and dairy — that have the same flavor profiles as traditional dairy and meats — has reached an inflection point over the past few years. certainly venture capital interest into the industry has soared along with the appetite from traditional protein purveyors like danone, tyson foods, and others to take a bite out of the market. some industry insiders think it was danone’s 2016 acquisition of whitewave in a $12.5 billion deal that was the signal which brought venture investors and food giants alike flocking to startups that were developing meat and dairy substitutes. the success of companies like beyond meat and impossible foods has only served to prove that a growing market exists for these substitutes. at the same time, solving the problem of protein for a growing global population is critical if the world is going to reverse course on climate change. agriculture and animal husbandry are huge contributors to the climate crisis and ones for which no solution has made it to market. investors think cultured proteins — fermented in tanks like brewing beer — could be an answer. photograph: david parry/epa “innovative or disruptive solutions are key to responding to changing consumer demand and to addressing the challenge of feeding a growing world population sustainably,” said kristen eshak weldon, head of food innovation & downstream strategy at louis dreyfus company (ldc), a leading merchant and processor of agricultural goods. “in this sense, we are excited to partner with motif, convinced that its next-generation ingredients will play a vital role.” breakthrough energy ventures certainly thinks so. the investment firm has been busy placing bets across a number of different biologically based solutions to reduce the emissions associated with agriculture and cultivation. pivot bio is a startup competing with ginkgo’s own joyn bio to create nitrogen fixing techniques for agriculture. and earlier this month, the firm invested as part of a $33 million round for sustainable bioproducts, which is using a proprietary bacteria found in a remote corner of yellowstone national park to make its own protein substitute. for all of these companies, the goal is nothing less than providing a commercially viable technology to combat some of the causes of climate change in a way that’s appealing to the average consumer. “sustainability and accessible nutrition are among the biggest challenges facing the food industry today. consumers are demanding mindful food options, but there’s a reigning myth that healthy and plant-based foods must come at a higher price, or cannot taste or function like the animal-based foods they aim to replicate,” said mcintyre, in a statement. “biotechnology and fermentation is our answer, and motif will be key to propelling the next food revolution with affordable, sustainable and accessible ingredients that meet the standards of chefs, food developers, and visionary brands.” *an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified jason kakoyiannis as jason kelly, ginkgo’s co-founder."
"hackers have hijacked thousands of exposed chromecast streaming devices to warn users of the latest security flaw to affect the device. but other security researchers say that the bug — if left unfixed — could be used for more disruptive attacks. the culprits, known as hacker giraffe and j3ws3r, have become the latest person to figure out how to trick google’s media streamer into playing any youtube video they want — including videos that are custom-made. this time around, the hackers hijacked forced the affected chromecasts to display a pop-up notice that’s viewable on the connected tv, warning the user that their misconfigured router is exposing their chromecast and smart tv to hackers like themselves. not one to waste an opportunity, the hackers also asks that you subscribe to pewdiepie, an awful internet person with a popular youtube following. (he’s the same hacker who tricked thousands of exposed printers into printing support for pewdiepie.) the bug, dubbed casthack, exploits a weakness in both chromecast and the router it connects to. the two said that disabling universal plug and play (upnp) should fix the problem, but this has been disputed by experts. “we have received reports from users who have had an unauthorized video played on their tvs via a chromecast device,” a google spokesperson told techcrunch. “this is not an issue with chromecast specifically, but is rather the result of router settings that make smart devices, including chromecast, publicly reachable,” the spokesperson said. that’s true on one hand, but it doesn’t address the underlying issue — that the chromecast can be tricked into allowing an unauthenticated attacker the ability to hijack a media stream and display whatever they want. hacker giraffe sent this youtube video to thousands of exposed chromecast devices, warning that their streams could be easily hijacked. (screenshot: techcrunch) bishop fox, a security consultancy firm, first found a hijack bug in 2014, not long after the chromecast debuted. the researchers found that they could conduct a “deauth” attack that disconnects the chromecast from the wi-fi network it was connected to, causing it to revert back to its out-of-the-box state, waiting for a device to tell it where to connect and what to stream. that’s when it can be hijacked and forced to stream whatever the hijacker wants. all of this can be done in an instant — as they did — with a touch of a button on a custom-built handheld remote. two years later, u.k. cybersecurity firm pen test partners discovered that the chromecast was still vulnerable to “deauth” attacks, making it easy to play content on a neighbor’s chromecasts in just a few minutes. ken munro, who founded pen test partners, says there’s “no surprise that somebody else stumbled on to it,” given both bishop fix found it in 2014 and his company tested it in 2016. “in fairness, we never thought that the service would be exposed on the public internet, so that is a very valid finding of his, full credit to him for that,” munro told techcrunch. (google said in a follow-up email that it’s working to fix the deauth bug.) he said the way the attack is conducted is different, but the method of exploitation is the same. casthack can be exploited over the internet, while bishop fox and his “deauth” attacks can be carried out within range of the wi-fi network — yet, both attacks let the hacker control what’s displayed on the tv from the chromecast, he said. munro said google should have fixed its bug in 2014 when it first had the chance. “allowing control over a local network without authentication is a really silly idea on [google’s] part,” he said. “because users do silly things, like expose their tvs on the internet, and hackers find bugs in services that can be exploited.” but munro said that these kinds of attacks — although obnoxious and intrusive on the face of it — could be exploited to have far more malicious consequences. in a blog post wednesday, munro said it was easy to exploit other smart home devices — like an amazon echo — by hijacking a chromecast and forcing it to play commands that are loud enough to be picked up by its microphone. that’s happened before, when smart assistants get confused when they overhear words on the television or radio, and suddenly and without warning purchase items from amazon. (you can and should turn on a pin for ordering through amazon.) to name a few, munro said it’s possible to force a chromecast into loading a youtube video created by an attacker to trick an echo to: “alexa, order an ipad,” or, “alexa, turn off the house alarm,” or, “alexa, set an alarm every day at 3am.” amazon echos and other smart devices are widely considered to be secure, even if they’re prone to overhearing things they shouldn’t. often, the weakest link are humans. second to that, it’s the other devices around smart home assistants that pose the biggest risk, said munro in his blog post. that was demonstrated recently when canadian security researcher render man showed how using a sound transducer against a window can trick a nearby amazon echo into unlocking a network-connected smart lock on the front door of a house. “google needs to properly fix the chromecast deauth bug that allows casting of youtube traffic,” said munro. updated at 9pm et: with a new, clearer headline to better reflect the flaws over the years, and added additional comment from google. smart home tech makers don’t want to say if the feds come for your data"
"a report from bloomberg shares some of the details about the long-rumored video streaming service from apple. the company should unveil this service at a press conference in cupertino on march 25. while apple has been working on a ton of original content for its new streaming service, bloomberg says that most of it won’t be ready for the launch later this month. apple will probably share some teasers onstage, but the launch lineup will mostly feature third-party content. apple is probably talking with everyone, but many premium cable channels still have to decide about apple’s streaming service. hbo, showtime and starz have to decide by friday whether they want to be part of the launch. it’s unclear if apple is going to feature some or all content from those partners. many of them already have a streaming service on their own, and you can access their libraries from the tv app on your apple tv or ios device. apple could streamline the experience by letting you subscribe to various content bundles in its own streaming service. amazon already provides something similar with amazon prime video channels. netflix and hulu will likely remain independent services, as they compete directly with apple’s original content effort. when it comes to apple’s other announcement, the company should also unveil its apple news subscription on march 25. apple acquired texture last year and has been working on a digital magazine subscription for a while. unsurprisingly, it looks like apple news' magazine service is prepared to launch on macos too pic.twitter.com/df0oyjxvjf — steve troughton-smith (@stroughtonsmith) march 12, 2019 once again, details are still thin for this new service when it comes to pricing, availability outside of the u.s. and content. last month, the wsj reported that apple has been working with goldman sachs on a credit card that would integrate deeply with the apple wallet app. given that apple’s event is about services, let’s see if the company talks about this new product, as well."
"a chinese voice assistant has been rapidly gaining ground in recent months. dueros, baidu’s answer to amazon’s alexa, reached over 200 million devices, china’s top search engine announced on its weibo official account last friday. to put that number into context, more than 100 million devices pre-installed with alexa have been sold, amazon recently said. google just announced it expected assitant to be on 1 billion devices by the end of this month. voice interaction technology is part of baidu’s strategy to reposition itself from a heavy reliance on search businesses towards artificial intelligence. the grand plan took a hit when the world-renown scientist lu qi stepped down as baidu’s chief operating officer, though the segment appears to have scored healthy growth lately, with dueros more than doubling from a base of 90 million installs since last june. when it comes to how many devices actually use dueros regularly, the number is much less significant: 35 million machines a month at the time baidu’s general manager for smart home devices announced the figure last november. like alexa, which has made its way into both amazon-built echo speakers and oems, dueros also takes a platform play to power both baidu-built and third-party devices. interestingly, dueros has achieved all that with fewer capabilities and a narrower partnership network than its american counterpart. by the end of 2018, alexa could perform more than 56,000 skills. devices from over 4,500 brands can now be controlled with alexa, says amazon. by comparison, baidu’s voice assistant had 800 different skills, its chief architect zhong lei revealed at the company’s november event. it was compatible with 85 brands at the time. the number of alexa skills in the u.s. more than doubled in 2018 this may well imply that dueros’s allies include heavy-hitters with outsize user bases. baidu itself could be one as it owns one of china’s biggest navigation app, which is second to alibaba’s autonavi in terms of number of installs, according to data from iresearch. baidu said in october that at least 140 million people had activated the voice assistant of its maps service. furthermore, baidu speakers have managed to crack a previously duopolistic market. a report from canalys shows that baidu clocked in a skyrocketing 711 percent quarter-to-quarter growth to become china’s third-biggest vendor of smart speakers during q3 last year. top players alibaba and xiaomi, on the other hand, both had a sluggish season. while baidu deploys dueros to get home appliances talking, it has doubled down on smart vehicles with apollo. the system, which the company calls the android for autonomous driving, counted 130 oems, parts suppliers and other forms of partners as of last october. it’s attracted global automakers volvo and ford who want a foothold in china’s self-driving movement. outside china, apollo has looked to microsoft azure cloud as it hunts for international partnerships. baidu has yet to prove commercial success for its young ai segment, but its conversational data trove holds potential for a lucrative future. baidu became china’s top advertising business in part by harnessing what people search on its engine. down the road, its ai-focused incarnation could apply the same data-crunching process to what people say to their machines."
"jun-sheng li contributor jun-sheng (jun) li is an executive in residence at canvas ventures and was the former senior vice president of walmart's global e-commerce supply chain. as svp of walmart’s global e-commerce supply chain for five years (until 2018), i had a front-row seat to how brick-and-mortar retailers were responding to amazon’s dominance in e-commerce. most of us were alarmed. and who could blame us? today, amazon has nearly 50 percent of all e-commerce trade. the way i see it, if you are a brick-and-mortar retailer, you either embrace a digital strategy to become omnichannel or do nothing and become irrelevant. to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, let’s step back to understand how we got here. and importantly, start with what i believe is the single biggest challenge for retailers today. holy grail: become truly omnichannel omnichannel retailing has become the goal that every retailer is aiming for — but few know how to achieve. in a nutshell, omnichannel simply means providing customers a seamless, continuous experience wherever customers would like to shop — across any device or store location — with a unified brand experience. for example, i can buy a pair of shoes from nordstrom using my smartphone and choose to pick up my purchase at a store or have it delivered to my home. if i want to return the shoes for any reason, i can do so by mail or return them at a store. my interaction with nordstrom consistently flows from one channel to another. but from a brick-and-mortar retailer’s perspective, that’s easier said than done. a lot more moving parts they say the “devil’s in the details,” and i would add the “details are in the supply chain.” and today’s supply chain is more complex than ever — especially if you’re a traditional, brick-and-mortar retailer striving to transform into an omnichannel. to start, you have to get your head around doing things very differently. you will be: distributing products to millions of homes instead of hundreds of stores. managing millions of skus (stock keeping units) instead of thousands. shipping to homes in parcels (including last-mile delivery) instead of truckloads to stores. running fulfillment centers (fcs) in addition to distribution centers (dcs). fcs ship goods directly to customers. dcs ship goods to stores. want to be an omnichannel? be ready to add “fulfillment centers” to your existing mix of “distribution centers.” the level of complexity will increase by orders of magnitude. three key challenges to omnichannel excellence these are the top-three most intransigent challenges you will face in your omnichannel quest: organizational and management constraints. people can be resistant to change. many find it hard to think in new paradigms. different business units have different processes, kpis (key performance indicators) and incentives. sharing of assets across all channels can be difficult. for example, how should you allocate warehouse space and balance the availability of products (i.e. inventory) between online and in-store sales? process and systems challenges first you need to plan: you must aggregate demand forecasting and planning for both physical and online sales by channel. then figure out what you have: determine product assortment across all channels: dcs, fcs, your own stores and even third-party locations like a marketplace vendor. lastly, you need to know from where to ship your products. you must instantaneously track what was sold against a global inventory spread across myriad locations. continuous innovation a brick-and-mortar retailer will need to continually learn new processes and technologies that impact your supply chain. for example: learn new processes when integrating fcs into your supply chain network. this includes new ways to receive, sort, store, pick, pack, ship and house products in lockers or stores for drive-through and pick-ups. these processes are completely different from what is used at traditional dcs or stores. keep abreast of packaging technology, both the method of packing (optimizing how much you can fit into a package) and the materials (consider what’s best for long distance, the environment, costs and the protection of the product, especially if it involves home delivery of groceries with thermal foam or totes). meet the demands of home grocery shopping and “last-mile” deliveries. in addition to delivering goods in full truckloads from dcs to stores, you must learn how to operate so-called “milk runs” from stores to customer homes. when delivering groceries to a home, you must adhere to certain time slots and sometimes make “live deliveries” to ensure perishable goods are received promptly and safely. this entails a constantly refreshed and technologically modern tms (transportation management system).  amazon had a wide-open field going back to the headline of this article, how did amazon become the e-commerce behemoth that it is today with seemingly little resistance from traditional retailers? were the brick-and-mortar executives asleep at the wheel? to answer that question, some historical framing could help:  the four waves of e-commerce so what’s a retailer to do? i think we’re at the point of no return. the omnichannel train has left the station. what would i do if i ran a retail business today? first, i would accept the fact that customers now love to shop both online and offline, and they expect two-day shipping for certain products and near flawless execution. the bar has been set high by amazon. then i would create a game plan that leverages my existing physical assets like warehouses, distribution centers and stores to offer new services like ship-from-store or pickup-at-store. i would also build new fulfillment centers specifically to fulfill online orders and ship to customers’ homes. although amazon dominates e-commerce, there are multitudes of department stores and retail brands with successful digital platforms. i was on the walmart team from 2013 to 2018 when walmart invested heavily in their omnichannel strategy. on february 19, 2019, walmart announced their fy 2019 q4 results, which showed the company grew e-commerce sales by 43 percent year-over-year in its last quarter, blowing past estimates for the holiday season. of course, many factors go into an effective omnichannel strategy. the biggest factor, in my mind, is simply to gather the corporate will and get started."
"two years ago, aspect ratios were all the rage. these days, it’s 5g and foldable all the way down, making the xperia 1 a bit of a throwback. these days, the company’s getting even longer, with a 21:9 display on sony’s new flagship. the idea is to make things as cinematic as is possible for a 6.5-inch smartphone, keeping the dimensions closer to the way filmmakers shoot. the screen is a 4k hdr oled that leverages the master monitor color reproduction sony developed for films. it’s a marked change for sony, which largely relies on camera innovations to help stand out from the pack. of course, there’s a bit of that in here too. the handset is capable of shooting video in 4k hdr at 24fps in the 21:9 format. given that it’s not currently a particularly popular aspect ratio for handsets at this point, you can always switch to something a bit more common. as for content, sony says it’s working with a number of providers to customize things, including netflix, amazon prime and youtube on the video side and gameloft, 10 cent and fortnite developer epic for games. the handset will be available in late-spring. pricing is still tbd. sony also took the opportunity to launch a pair of mid-range phones, the xperia 10 and xperia 10 plus. both handsets sport the 21:9 aspect ratio on 6.0 and 6.5-inch handsets, respectively. those devices run $359 and $430. they’ll be arriving in the u.s. march 18."
"lenovo knows a good smart assistant when it sees one. the company was one of the first to team with google on a third-party smart display, and now it’s getting in on the ground floor for alexa tablets. the company just announced two devices — the smart tab m10 and p10. both are 10.1-inch tablets that are among the first non-amazon fire tablets to sport the smart assistant. the devices ship with the company’s new smart dock, which toggles the slates into show mode, so they can effectively double as echo shows while charging. the dock/stand has three-watt speakers and three built-in microphones listening for alexa commands. lenovo’s positioning this as a kind of travel echo show, which is an interesting take on the category. the dock itself isn’t small, but the whole setup is certainly more portable than attempting to slip a smart speaker in your bag. i’m not sure how much of a demand there is for such a thing, but i know at least one techcrunch staffer who goes through smart speaker withdrawals when he’s on the road, so maybe there’s something to be said for it, after all. as for the tablets themselves, the primary difference between the two is design language. the p10 is the slicker, thinner and lighter of the two models. it also sports more ram (4gb), more storage (up to 64gb) and a beefy 7,000mah battery. at $300, it’s also a full $100 more than the m10. both will be arriving this month."
"you might hear stories that techcrunch favors venture-backed companies, or will only write about startups that have raised from certain vcs. well, i can tell you that is totally untrue. in fact, it couldn’t be further from the truth. speaking for myself, i really enjoy talking to successful bootstrapped companies. raising money can be a validation, but it certainly isn’t a measure of success in itself… with more money comes increased responsibilities. that’s an unusual preamble, but it sets the scene for skill-lync, an india-based online education company that is currently part of the y combinator program in the u.s. the business is bootstrapped and developing a fascinating service that helps india’s thousands of engineering graduates to turn their book smarts into employable skills and jobs. skill-lync started out as a youtube channel to share engineering tips, but today it is an online training course for mechanical engineering candidates. it operates three different types of courses, ranging from one-off modules to full-time curriculums. with an estimated 1.5 million mechanic engineering graduates leaving india universities and colleges each year, competition for jobs is tough but equally, with many overseas markets seeking skilled talent, there are international opportunities but many students are unaware of how to pursue them. skill-lync seeks to match mechanical engineers with u.s-based masters degree courses and/or employers directly. that’s done through an online learning course that uses video content developed alongside industry companies — the goal is to help instill employable skills and experience to students. students watch videos independently but come together in groups on whatsapp to work on assignments. course teachers operate virtual ‘open hours’ on a friday to allow interaction with students, questions and more. the regular courses cost $250 per unit and cover specific areas related to mechanic engineering and its application in the workplace. last year, some 2,500 students took part in skill-lync courses and while the courses are demanding, with around a 22 percent completion rate, the results are impressive for those who cross the finishing line. so impressive, in fact, that skill-lync is launching a new and more comprehensive course that guarantees a job at the end of it or else participants get a full refund. the new course — which guarantees employment or a refund — lasts for eight months of 40 hours per week, with a part-time option of 20 hours per week over 15 months. it is priced at rs. 245,000 — around $3,500 — and open to qualified candidates based in india. “students learn in-depth technical concepts in developing a full-fledged hybrid electric vehicle,” co-founders suryanarayanan paneerselvam and sarangarajan iyengar — who studied in india before getting on masters degrees and later jobs in the u.s. — told techcrunch. “the course teaches students concepts such as battery performance management, electric & ic engine powertrain, strength analysis (finite element analysis), external aerodynamics & design.” the first cohort will open in april, enrollment applications are open until march 15. skill-lync founders suryanarayanan paneerselvam and sarangarajan iyengar (left and right) started with a youtube but now have a business that helps mechanical engineers developed employable skills to get hired paneerselvam and iyengar expect that the higher commitment requirement can boost their completion rate to 67%, that would be double what it is currently is for individual courses. the duo is exploring options to help students earn money during the course through crowd-sourced support. “we believe that education is like a product,” paneerselvam said in an interview. “in the same way that you buy a product from amazon but if it doesn’t work you can return it for a refund.” the company is also preparing to launch a similar program to u.s-based students in june, who currently account around 10 percent of monthly course enrollments. but rather than guaranteeing money back, that u.s-focused course will totally free upfront other than $700 to pay for software licenses for requisite mechanical engineering services. instead, skill-lync will make its money from graduates earning. “we will guarantee anyone who finishes our course a full-time job opportunity,” paneerselvam explained. “once they join a company, they will pay us 15 percent of their salary for two years. tuition will be capped at a maximum of $20,000. the student can also choose to pay $10,000 as a one time fee once they get a job after our course.” going forward, the ambitious company wants to apply its playbook to other industries beyond mechanical engineering. “we want to get into biotech and chemical engineering,” iyengar said. “we’ve basically created a playbook for mechanical engineering, now we need to apply it to other engineering disciplines.” that’ll mean hiring experts in those disciplines and continuing to work with industry leaders to develop course content. it’s a move that is also likely to boost female participation — 98 percent of current students are male — which is something that the skill-lync founders are keen to make progress on. more, widely, they believe that they could replace college-based training for skilled engineering in the future. “in the future, we can be a college ourselves as an online platform, where a student can say ‘hey, i don’t need 4 years of college, i’ll take this course and get a job,'” said paneerselvam. “we know the path for this but currently we are not focusing on it.” the more immediate goal is to scale the new courses. y combinator is well known for its impressive network that connects promising startups to vcs. skill-lync is aiming to take advantage of that to raise something in the region of $5 million to develop its service into this wider vision. “for what we are doing right now, we don’t need money,” paneerselvam explained. “but the goal is in the next two years to take this masters program and scale it to 30,000 students. we seriously believe that possible across different domains.” on the positive side, skill-lync has picked a good time to go after funding with a number of companies bringing digital learning to the fore. investors have never been more keen on exploring the potential to democratize knowledge via the internet in india. byju’s recently raised $550 million to globalize its courses, which are aimed at grades 4-12, and spent $120 million to acquire osmo, a startup that develops hardware to meld online and offline learning for kids. while u.s.-india company emeritus was the beneficiary of a $40 million series c and topper raised $35 million in december."
"what if, instead of sitting on your phone on the sofa ordering stuff from amazon, you could buy the same things locally from local stores that ultimately enliven and enrich your local neighborhood? what if by doing that, you wouldn’t be walking through deserted main streets, past boarded-up shops, dark alleys and graffiti? what if someone created a marketplace for independent businesses, local events and experiences that kept the money in the local economy rather than being siphoned off into global giants who don’t care about human-scale communities? that’s the idea behind pixie, a new take on the “shop-local app” startup model which, although it’s been tried before, has never quite managed to take off. perhaps pixie will have more luck? here’s how it works: the pixie app connects people to independent businesses through a curated marketplace, incentivizing them to pay through the app and get rewarded for being loyal customers. integrated into the app is pixie pay, a bespoke payment solution which keeps money in local hands. the startup has a fascinating background. whilst serving in the british special forces, pixie’s founder greg barden understood that his mission was also to ‘win hearts and minds’ with the local population. whether by buying bread from the local baker in a village in afghanistan, or coffee from the market in baghdad, he and his soldiers could tear down even the most hostile barriers. he also realized that when more money stayed inside these the local economies rather than being sucked away by organized crime or large scale, globalized businesses, the local economy might flourish and the risk of the societies there becoming yet again destabilized could potentially diminish. “whether it was stalls in the bazaars of baghdad or small boutiques on bath high-street, i realized independent shop owners are linchpins in their community. they add variety to the mundane and nurture community spirit. even local guardians need protecting sometimes, which is why we created pixie.” the threat to independent stores from globalization and digitization isn’t just happening in afghanistan. across the western world, ‘main street’ stores are closing at a prodigious rate. in the uk over 1,500 local stores closed in 2018. (and that was before brexit…) pixie has stress-tested its idea in mid-sized town in the uk, including bath, frome and sherbourne, completing transactions across 250 businesses, ranging from cafes to fashion boutiques, and spinning up 5,000 app users. it’s now going on the fund-raising trail, aiming to raise £500,000 in funding through its ‘equity for explorers’ campaign on crowdcube a uk-based crowd-equity platform. the total addressable market for independent business in the uk is estimated to be £31.5bn in gross transactional value. barden — who last year spoke about his startup life at the launch of the military tech non-profit techvets — says: “there might be thousands of independent businesses across the uk, but at the rate the high-street is disappearing they are severely under threat. pixie isn’t here to turn people away from the bigger players on the high-street, but create opportunities for enriching discovery. needless to say, in a world with increasing nationalism, brexit, trump and — dare i say it — amazon, we feel pixie has a huge part to play in countering the worst aspects of globalization.” pixie’s revenue comes from transaction fees taken when people use its ‘pixie pay’ payment mechanism. the payment system is designed to bypass visa/mastercard at the point of sale, whilst the loyalty scheme unites independent businesses under one umbrella, so the users can earn and spend their loyalty points (as money) across the entire pixie community. if a store using pixie is in australia, a person from bath could also use their points there. this keeps the money circulating inside local, independent stores, wherever they are on the planet. pixie distributes its own payment terminal that sits next to whatever the business has in place to take normal card payments (izettle etc). the cards are contactless but don’t utilise visa mastercard. it’s literally their own e-money system. think paypal where users can either add money to their balance by debit card or bank and/or link a debit card to pixie if they don’t have a balance. obviously this also creates it an alternative to competitors like izettle, square, sumup and worldpay, but this time specifically aimed at local independent stores, not huge national and international chains. the third element of pixie is its discovery marketplace that gives its community of explorers (users) the ability to discover local businesses across the pixie footprint of stores. i’ve seen several startups try and tackle this problem, but it may well be that pixie, under its charismatic leader, finally has a shot at cracking this idea around local markets."
"apple’s new streaming service is poised to launch this spring, according to the information, citing three unnamed sources. tucked away in a report about amazon’s plans to dial down its efforts with its subscription video offering, the information noted that apple has been telling entertainment partners to be ready for a mid-april launch for the streaming service. but the report also said the actual launch date could be within several weeks of that time frame. a spring launch date would fall in line with earlier reports, which said apple’s video streaming service would launch in the first half of 2019. apple ceo tim cook also vaguely confirmed its plans in this area, when speaking with cnbc earlier this month. he said that apple would announce “material” new additions to its line of service offerings this year. these could include the upcoming news and magazine subscription service, which is also rumored for a spring arrival, and possibly new services in the health space. apple has been gearing up for its streaming service for some time, acquiring rights and making deals for a number of tv shows and movies — it even just brokered its first movie deal at sundance 2019 on monday. however, apple’s original content may not be the only thing to watch on the new service. apple may include an amazon channels-like offering as a part of its video service, the new report said. this, too, has been claimed previously by both bloomberg and cnbc. this amazon channels-like model has been copied throughout the competitive streaming market because of the low overhead and the big cut amazon and roku take on subscription sales — around 30 percent, the information says. for example, roku this week launched its own video subscriptions in the roku channel; sling tv rolled out a selection of premium à la carte channels last year; and media center software maker plex aims to do the same in 2019. walmart had been rumored to be entering this market via vudu, its video marketplace that’s now its key focus for competing on streaming. even facebook is considering an amazon channels-like offering, the report said. apple’s decision to move forward with a spring — or possibly, even mid-april — launch date would see its service going head-to-head with disney+, the disney-owned netflix competitor that will be shown off to investors on april 11. but what’s still unclear is how apple will be marketing and selling its streaming offering — reports have varied on this front, claiming everything from a bundle with apple music and news to being entirely free."
"an atlas cargo plane flying on behalf of amazon air — amazon’s own freight delivery service that competes with fedex and ups, among others — has crashed outside houston, texas, killing three people on board. amazon and atlas both confirmed the accident with short statements. neither provided any details on the nature of the accident. “our thoughts and prayers are with the flight crew, their families and friends along with the entire team at atlas air during this terrible tragedy. we appreciate the first responders who worked urgently to provide support,” said dave clark, svp of worldwide operations at amazon. “this is to confirm that an atlas air 767 cargo aircraft flight no. 3591 operating from miami to houston has been involved in an accident this afternoon,” reads a statement from atlas. “we understand the aircraft went down near the city of anahuac, texas, in the trinity bay. we can confirm there were three people on board the aircraft. those people and their family members are our top priority at this time. atlas air is cooperating fully with the faa and ntsb. we will update as additional information becomes available.” the boeing 767 cargo jetliner lost contact on radio and radar around 12:45pm local time after crashing into trinity bay close to anahuac, a small city about 30 miles from houston. local news reported officials on the ground saying there is unlikely to be survivors. the aircraft, atlas air flight 3591, was flying from miami on behalf of amazon, according to flight tracking site flightradar24. many are reporting the crash as a “prime air” incident, but this isn’t completely accurate. originally, amazon air was branded “prime air”, and this appears to be the logo that still runs on many of these planes — but amazon rebranded the service in december 2017. amazon prime air now refers to the company’s efforts to build a drone delivery network. as we have noted, it is not yet clear what caused the crash. the federal aviation administration confirmed the accident in a statement, deferring the investigation to the national transportation safety board, which said in a tweet that it has dispatched investigators to the crash site. counting today’s plane, amazon has 40 aircraft operating under the amazon air brand, serving some 23 airports in the u.s. one looming question is how and if today’s incident will impact amazon’s bigger strategy with freight delivery. the company has been building its own network of cargo planes since 2015, a strategy that serves a couple of purposes. it gives amazon more control (both in terms of scheduling and costs) over air-based logistics for the transport of goods that it sells; and it gives amazon a shot at taking on some of the air shipping business that fedex and ups provide for other companies. amazon air has quietly but steadily grown over the years. amazon currently has plans to add another 10 aircraft during 2019 and 2020, leasing them from air transport services group, an atlas competitor. notably, amazon has stakes in both atlas and atsg as part of this bigger bet on taking on other larger cargo carriers with its own freight delivery service. amazon air expands with 10 more cargo aircraft, bringing fleet to 50 planes"
"the heated debate around amazon’s recently announced long island city “hq2” is showing no signs of cooling down. on monday morning, the retail, wholesale and department store union (rwdsu) hosted a briefing in which labor officials, economic development analysts, amazon employees and elected new york state and city representatives further underlined concerns around the hq2 process, the awarded incentives, and the potential impacts amazon’s presence would have on city workers and residents. while many of the arguments posed at the summit weren’t necessarily new, the wide variety of stakeholders that showed up to express concern looked to contextualize the far-reaching risks associated with the deal. the day began with representatives from new york union groups recounting amazon’s shaky history with employee working conditions and questioning how the city’s working standards will be impacted if the 50,000 promised jobs do actually show up. two current employees working in an existing amazon new york city warehouse in staten island provided poignant examples of improper factory conditions and promised employee benefits that never came to fruition. according to the workers, amazon has yet to follow through on shuttle services and ride-sharing services that were promised to ease worker commutes, forcing the workers to resort to overcrowded and unreliable public transportation. one of the workers detailed that with his now four-hour commute to get to and from work, coupled with his meaningfully long shifts, he’s been unable to see his daughter for weeks. various economic development groups and elected officials including, new york city comptroller scott stringer, city council speaker corey johnson, city council member jimmy van bramer, and new york state senator mike gianaris supported the labor arguments with spirited teardowns of the economic terms of the deal. like many critics of the hq2 process, the speakers’ expressed their beliefs that amazon knew where it wanted to bring its second quarters throughout the entirety of its auction process, given the talent pool and resources in the chosen locations, and that the entire undertaking was meant to squeeze out the best economic terms possible. and according to city council speaker johnson, new york city “got played”. comptroller stringer argued that amazon is taking advantage of new york’s relocation and employment assistance program (reap) and industrial and commercial abatement program (icap), which stringer described as outdated and in need of reform, to receive the majority of the $2 billion-plus in promised economic incentives that made it the fourth largest corporate incentive deal in us history. the speakers continued to argue that the unprecedented level of incentives will be nearly impossible to recoup and that new york will also face economic damages from lower sales tax revenue as improved amazon service in the city cannibalizes local brick & mortar retail. fears over how amazon’s presence will impact the future of new york were given more credibility with the presence of seattle city council members lisa herbold & teresa mosqueda, who had flown to new york from seattle to discuss lessons learned from having amazon’s headquarters in the city and to warn the city about the negative externalities that have come with it. herbold and mosqueda focused less on an outright rejection of the deal but instead emphasized that new york was in a position to negotiate for better terms focused on equality and corporate social responsibility, which could help the city avoid the socioeconomic turnover that has plagued seattle and could create a new standard for public-private partnerships. while the new york city council noted it was looking into legal avenues, the opposition seemed to have limited leverage to push back or meaningfully negotiate the deal. according to state officials, the most clear path to fight the deal would be through votes by the state legislature and through the state public authorities control board who has to unanimously approve the subsidy package. with the significant turnout seen at monday’s summit, which included several high-ranking state and city officials, it seems clear that we’re still in the early innings of what’s likely to be a long battle ahead to close the hq2 deal. in response to the summit, an amazon spokesperson offered the following statement: “amazon is engaging in a long-term listening and engagement process to better understand the community’s needs. we’re committed to being a great neighbor – and ensuring our new headquarters is a win for all new yorkers. amazon makes substantial positive contributions to the economy, the communities where we operate, and to the lives and careers of our employees. we have created more than 250,000 full-time, full benefit jobs across the u.s. that now have a minimum $15 an hour pay and we have invested more than $160 billion in the u.s. economy since 2011.” updated with statement from amazon."
"it might be strange to imagine now, but it was only a few years ago when the presence of netflix, hulu, and other streaming platforms at major award shows was considered disruptive. today’s golden globes showed how formidable streaming platforms have become, with netflix’s “roma” winning the awards for best foreign language film and best director, strong harbingers for success at next month’s academy awards (“roma” previously won the golden lion, the venice film festival’s highest honor). written and directed by alfonso cuarón, “roma” was one of the best reviewed films of 2018 and its award prospects prompted netflix to change its long-standing theatrical release model for original films. when netflix had previously agreed to release its films in theaters, it did so without granting the theaters an exclusive release window. instead, it insisted that its movies could only be released in theaters if they premiered on its streaming service at the same time. as a result, few theaters carried netflix films and the rule may have hurt some films’ chances of being nominated for major awards. for example, the cannes film festival implemented a rule last year that effectively barred netflix films from competing. roma’s prospects and its pedigree (cuarón won an oscar for directing “gravity”) gave netflix enough incentive to change its policies. along with “the ballad of buster scruggs,” directed by the coen brothers, and “bird box,” directed by susanne bier, “roma” was given an exclusive theatrical run in some markets, opening a few weeks before being released on netflix. cuarón was also nominated for a best screenplay-motion picture at the golden globes, but lost that award to “green book” writers peter farrelly, nick vallelonga, and brian currie. some shows that usually dominate the list of golden globe winners, including hbo’s “game of thrones” and netflix’s “the crown” weren’t eligible to compete this year, making room for other productions to shine. netflix had a total of 13 nominations (eight for tv series and five for films), amazon received nine nominations for tv series, and hulu earned two nominations for “the handmaid’s tale.” (variety is live-updating a full list of nominations and winners here).  other victories for streaming services included rachel brosnahan’s win for best performance by an actress in a television series–musical or comedy for amazon’s “the marvelous mrs. maisel,” while “a very english scandal’s” ben whishaw scored another acting win for amazon by landing the award for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series, limited series or motion picture made for television. the star of netflix’s “bodyguard” (originally produced for the bbc), richard madden, won best performance by an actor in a television series-drama for star richard madden."
"after days of demos and announcements and miles of walking, i’m confident in declaring holoride the best thing at this year’s ces. the designation of “the best thing at ces 2019” is my badging. this isn’t an official award handed out by a governing body. this is just me saying holoride is the best thing i’ve seen at the show. this year’s ces is fine, i guess. the main theme is connecting services around the smart home. there’s a huge range of devices that now support services from amazon, google and apple. ces 2019 also featured the launch of new silicon chipsets and self-driving platforms. but the thing that impressed me the most is from holoride, a startup from audi that wants to put vr in cars to entertain and reduce motion sickness. iron man needs help, rocket told me. and like that i was thrust into a space battle against thanos’ bad guys. there was an oculus on my head and my body was dipping and diving, shooting through space, while i was waving my hands around, blasting the enemy. it was straight out of disney world (partly because disney helped with the content). except i was in vegas, in the back of an audi suv hitting speeds of 90 mph on a track. after two laps around the track, i walked away fine. i didn’t feel sick at all, even though i’m the sort of person who can’t look at their phone in a car. matching the vr content to the vehicle’s movements is key to the holoride experience. in short, when the car moves, the content moves in the same way. this reduces motion sickness, and, from my demo, i can confirm it works — at least on me. the technology comes from a small startup recently spun out of audi in a play to put vr in every car. the founders have been working on the technology behind the in-car vr system for several years. the automaker holds a minority interest through subsidiary audi electronics venture, which helped develop the technology. audi will license the technology to holoride and the startup will use an open platform to allow any automaker as well as content developers to create whatever reality formats they desire. i’ve experienced countless vr experiences, and this was one of the best demos i’ve had. the use case is compelling too. not only does it provide entertainment, but it also solves motion sickness. it’s easy to imagine this in an ad-supported format in the back of an uber or while on a long-distance bus. it could work in planes too. it could improve long car rides with the kids. holoride is a longshot and there are countless questions around the content, consumer outreach and compatibility. in order for it to take off, the company needs to build an ecosystem complete with developers, auto makers and consumers. building amazing experiences is one thing; selling amazing experiences is even harder. i used vr in a car going 90 mph and didn’t get sick audi spins out holoride to put vr in every car"

"amazon just over a year ago launched its first in-home furniture brands, with private labels rivet and stone & beam. this past fall, it began experimenting with a new, more visual way to shop for furniture and other merchandise with its pinterest-like recommendation service scout. now, amazon is venturing further into home furnishings with the debut of amazon showroom, a visual design tool that allows you to place furniture into a virtual living room, customize the décor, then shop the look. the retailer didn’t formally announce the launch of amazon showroom, but a spokesperson confirmed it’s a recent test that’s now available on amazon.com and in the amazon mobile app. you can access it from the “accounts & lists” drop-down on the web; the home, garden & pets department on the web; or the home & kitchen department on the mobile app. currently, the new feature is focused on helping amazon shoppers put together a living room. in a virtual setting, you can make adjustments to the wall color and the flooring, then swap out each item in the space with one of your own choosing — including the sofa, coffee table, chair, end table, lamp, rug and even the art on the wall. to do so, click on the piece in question, then pick another from the right-side panel where a scrollable list of options are available, along with their prices. this selection can be filtered by a number of factors, as well, like price, style, color, material, brand and star rating. not surprisingly, amazon’s own home furnishing brands are heavily featured here. as you work on your project, you can save your room design to pull up later. and you can save more than one room design, if you’re trying to decide between different styles. when satisfied, an “add to cart” button lets you place all into your cart for checkout with just one click. amazon showroom — a name that’s almost a cruel reference to amazon’s ability to turn brick-and-mortar stores into showrooms for online shoppers — isn’t the retailer’s first attempt at helping shoppers visualize items in their home ahead of purchase. the company also launched an ar shopping feature in its app in 2017, which allows you to place a virtual item in your camera view to see how it goes in your own room. that can be useful if shopping for a single item, but less so when designing a complete room. home furnishings is still an emerging category for online retail, not only because they’re hard to visualize, but also because heavy items are expensive to ship. however, major retailers see the potential in this growing market. walmart, for example, launched a new home shopping site for furniture and décor last year, which features its own in-house brands and more visual, editorial-style imagery. it has also snapped up other home furnishing and décor retailers, including hayneedle and recently, art.com, and is building its own visual search. amazon confirmed the launch of showroom in a statement. the retailer wouldn’t say when the feature debuted, exactly, but a twitter account was tweeting links to a pre-production site earlier in december. amazon confirmed that amazon showroom was built entirely in-house. “amazon showroom is a new way for customers to visualize their home furnishing purchases when shopping online,” a spokesperson told techcrunch. “amazon showroom presents customers with a virtual living room, where they can customize the décor and furniture selection providing the ability to visually compare to scale representations of furniture items together in a room to determine how an item will fit with the style of a room and work with other complimentary pieces. the result is a photorealistic rendering of a room that answers the question: ‘how will this all look together?’,” they said. the feature is live for all customers on the web and in the amazon app. update, 1/4/19, 1:50 pm et with confirmation from amazon that showroom was built in-house."
"freshman congresswoman and meme queen alexandria ocasio-cortez is headed to netflix. the streaming service said this week that it has snapped up “knock down the house,” a sundance award-winning documentary profiling the campaigns of four female progressive candidates, including ocasio-cortez, in the 2018 midterm election. the documentary raised money via a kickstarter campaign last year and it grabbed the festival favorite award at the 2019 sundance film festival, beating 121 other contenders to land the highest number of audience votes. that acclaim and the rising star of ocasio-cortez looks to have made the picture a hot commodity. deadline reports that netflix is spending $10 million to secure the film, a price that — if true — would make it the most expensive sundance documentary deal to date. it apparently beat off competition from neon, focus, hulu and amazon to land the production, according to deadline. “knock down the house,” produced by new york’s jubilee films, profiles the campaigns of las vegas businesswoman amy vilela, saint louis nurse cori bush, coal miner’s daughter paula jean swearengin in west virginia and new york-based alexandria ocasio-cortez, who worked double shifts at restaurants to pay her family’s bills. none of the women had previous political experience, but they gained attention after taking on heavyweight incumbents because they believed that the american system needed to change. of the challengers, only ocasio-cortez won the vote and made it to washington. “it is a transcendent moment when skilled filmmakers are able to train their lens on a major transformation,” lisa nishimura, vp of original documentaries for netflix, said in a statement. “with intimacy and immediacy, [filmmakers] rachel lears and robin blotnik, bring viewers to the front lines of a movement, as four women find their voice, their power and their purpose, allowing all of us to witness the promise of true democracy in action.” this is not netflix’s first major foray into u.s. political programming. the company signed up former u.s. president barack obama and his wife michelle in a production deal announced last year, although the exact content that’ll come from that collaboration is not clear at this point. “they have their eyes on film and television, fiction and non-fiction. they want to do programming, storytelling that fits in with what they did during the presidency, obviously,” netflix chief content officer ted sarandos said last year, although he did rule out a focus on politics. obama was the first guest on david letterman’s netflix show and he indirectly features in the company’s catalog under “barry,” a drama that’s based on his life as a college student. all your meme are belong to aoc"
"french startup mirakl raised a $70 million funding round. bain capital is leading the round, with existing investors 83north, felix capital and elaia partners also participating. if you’ve bought a few products from a third-party seller on an e-commerce website that isn’t amazon or alibaba, chances are you’ve used mirakl in the past. the company has built a solution to manage the marketplace of your e-commerce platform. while mirakl doesn’t have a ton of customers, each customer is very valuable. the company has worked with some of the biggest names in e-commerce so that they could add a new revenue stream with a marketplace. examples include best buy in canada, walmart in mexico, office depot and darty. the startup also lets you create b2b marketplaces for bulk selling and other complicated transactions. sellers can set minimum and maximum quantities and customize their listings. in 2018, the startup managed to add 60 customers and launch 37 marketplaces — it doubled the gross merchandise volume compared to 2017. and it’s true that marketplaces are attractive. you can greatly increase your sales without any physical infrastructure investment as third-party sellers handle logistics. behind the scene, mirakl has developed connectors that work with multiple e-commerce platforms. after setting up mirakl, your third-party sellers will also get their own on-boarding back end. and mirakl continuously helps you when it comes to maintaining a certain level of quality and handling orders. more recently, mirakl has developed a catalog manager so that you can more easily manage product listings. it lets you get product information, merge product listings and moderate your platform in general. any e-commerce website can use it, not just websites that operate a mirakl marketplace. the company has also launched a services marketplace so you can upsell your customers with extended warranties and insurance products from third-party companies before they check out. mirakl works with global b2b platforms as well as retail websites that usually operate in a country or a handful of countries. thirty percent of retail clients are french, 30 percent are american and 40 percent are from the rest of the world. the startup charges an upfront fee as well as a monthly subscription that varies according to the success of your marketplace. with today’s funding round, the company plans to do more of the same, at a bigger scale. mirakl will expand the team, expand to new countries and improve its product offering."
"conventional wisdom would suggest that in 2019, the public cloud dominates and enterprise data centers are becoming an anachronism of a bygone era, but new data from synergy research finds that the enterprise data center market had a growth spurt last year. in fact, synergy reported that overall spending in enterprise infrastructure, which includes elements like servers, switches and routers and network security; grew 13 percent last year and represents a $125 billion business — not too shabby for a market that is supposedly on its deathbed. overall these numbers showed that market is still growing, although certainly not nearly as fast the public cloud. synergy was kind enough to provide a separate report on the cloud market, which grew 32 percent last year to $250 billion annually. as synergy analyst john dinsdale, pointed out, the private data center is not the only buyer here. a good percentage of sales is likely going to the public cloud, who are building data centers at a rapid rate these days. “in terms of applications and levels of usage, i’d characterize it more like there being a ton of growth in the overall market, but cloud is sucking up most of the growth, while enterprise or on-prem is relatively flat,” dinsdale told techcrunch.     perhaps the surprising data nugget in the report is that cisco remains the dominant vendor in this market with 23 percent share over the last four quarters. this, even as it tries to pivot to being more of a software and services vendor, spending billions on companies such as appdynamics, jasper technologies and duo security in recent years. yet data still shows that it still dominating in the traditional hardware sector. cisco snaps up appdynamics for $3.7b right before its ipo cisco remains the top vendor in the category in spite of losing a couple of percentage points in marketshare over the last year, primarily due to the fact they don’t do great in the server part of the market, which happens to be the biggest overall slice. the next vendor, hpe, is far back at just 11 percent across the six segments. while these numbers show that companies are continuing to invest in new hardware, the growth is probably not sustainable long term. at aws re:invent in november, aws president andy jassy pointed out that a vast majority of data remains in private data centers, but that we can expect that to begin to move more briskly to the public cloud over the next five years. and web scale companies like amazon often don’t buy hardware off the shelf, opting to develop custom tools they can understand and configure at a highly granular level. jassy said that outside the us, companies are one to three years behind this trend, depending on the market, so the shift is still going on, as the much bigger growth in the public cloud numbers indicates. aws wants to rule the world"
"nyc and boston were handed huge setbacks this week when amazon and ge decided to bail on their commitments to build headquarters in the respective cities on the same day. but it’s worth pointing out that while these large tech organizations were pulling out, google was expanding in both locations. yesterday, upon hearing about amazon’s decision to scrap its hq2 plans in long island city, new york city mayor de blasio had this to say: “instead of working with the community, amazon threw away that opportunity. we have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. if amazon can’t recognize what that’s worth, its competitors will.” one of them already has. google had already announced a billion-dollar expansion in hudson square at the end of last year. google is spending $1 billion to build a massive new campus in new york in fact, the company is pouring billions into nyc real estate, with plans to double its 7,000-person workforce over the next 10 years. as techcrunch’s jon russell reported, “our investment in new york is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in u.s. facilities, offices and jobs. in fact, we’re growing faster outside the bay area than within it, and this year opened new offices and data centers in locations like detroit, boulder, los angeles, tennessee and alabama, wrote google cfo ruth porat.” just this week, as ge was making its announcement, google was announcing a major expansion in cambridge, the city across the river from boston that is home to harvard and mit. kendall square is also home to offices from facebook, microsoft, ibm, akamai, digitalocean and a plethora of startups. google will be moving into a brand new building that currently is home to the mit coop bookstore. it plans to grab 365,000 square feet of the new building when it’s completed, and, as in nyc, will be adding hundreds of new jobs to the 1,500 already in place. brian cusack, google cambridge site lead points out the company began operations in cambridge back in 2003 and has been working on search, android, cloud, youtube, google play, research, ads and more. “this new space will provide room for future growth and further cements our commitment to the cambridge community. we’re proud to call this city home and will continue to support its vibrant nonprofit and growing business community,” he said in a statement. as we learned this week, big company commitments can vanish just as quickly as they are announced, but for now at least, it appears that google is serious about its commitment to new york and boston and will be expanding office space and employment to the tune of thousands of jobs over the next decade. boston and ny share high-tech losses as ge and amazon bail on same day"
"french startup blade, the company behind shadow, is launching a new set-top box to access its cloud gaming service — the shadow ghost. i’ve been playing with the device for a couple of weeks and here’s my review. the shadow ghost is a tiny little box that doesn’t do much. the true magic happens in a data center near your home. when you sign up to shadow, you don’t even have to get a box. you can simply subscribe to the service without any hardware device and use the company’s apps instead. shadow is a cloud computing service for gamers. for $35 per month, you can access a gaming pc in a data center and interact with this computer. right now, shadow gives you eight threads on an intel xeon 2620 processor, an nvidia quadro p5000 gpu that performs more or less as well as an nvidia geforce gtx 1080, 12gb of ram and 256gb of storage. you can optionally get more storage with an extra subscription. it’s a full windows 10 instance and you can do whatever you want with it. most subscribers now access shadow using one of the company’s apps on windows, macos or linux. you also can connect to your virtual machine from your ios or android phone or tablet. and now, you can buy the shadow ghost if you want to use the service on a tv or without a computer. i first used shadow during the early days of the service back in early 2017. my first experience of the service felt like magic. thanks to my high-speed fiber connection, i could play demanding games on a laptop. the best part was that the laptop fan would remain silent. but it wasn’t perfect. nvidia driver updates failed sometimes. or your virtual machine would become completely unaccessible without some help from the customer support team. in other words, the concept was great, but the service wasn’t there yet. things have changed quite drastically after years of iteration on the apps, the streaming engine, the infrastructure and even the gpus in the data centers. blade co-founder and ceo emmanuel freund told me that the service has been working fine for just a few months. it’s no surprise that those technical improvements have led to less churn, more referrals and more subscriptions. in july 2018, the startup had 20,000 subscribers. now there are 65,000 subscribers. there’s even more demand, but the company has had a hard time keeping up with new machines in data centers. shadow is currently available in france, the u.k., germany, belgium, luxembourg, switzerland and parts of the u.s. the company simply can’t accept customers from anywhere in the world because they need to live near a data center with shadow servers. playing with the shadow ghost the original shadow box was a bit clunky. you could hear the fan, you had to rely on dongles if you wanted to pair a bluetooth device or connect to a wi-fi network and there was no hdmi port — only displayport. internally, blade has been debating whether the company needs another box. in 2017, it was too hard to explain the product without some sort of physical device — you can replace a pc tower with a tiny box. but now that gamers understand the benefits of cloud gaming, there’s no reason to force you to buy a box. and yet, the shadow ghost can be a useful little device in some cases. for instance, while the company has released an android tv app and is testing a new app for the apple tv, your current tv setup might not be compatible with shadow. or maybe you primarily use a laptop and you want to create a desktop pc setup with a display, a keyboard, a mouse and a shadow ghost. everything has been improved. it is now a fanless device that consumes less than 5w when it’s on. it has an ethernet port, two usb 3.0 ports, two usb 2.0 ports, an audio jack and a single hdmi port. bluetooth and wi-fi have finally been integrated in the device. when you boot up the device, you get a menu to connect to a wi-fi network or control your bluetooth devices. you also can change some streaming settings, like in the app launcher. once you press the start button, the video stream starts and it feels like you’re using a windows computer. with steam’s big picture mode, you get a convenient setup for couch gaming. i had no issue playing demanding games, such as hitman 2. it works perfectly fine with a wi-fi connection and a bluetooth controller. using the shadow ghost feels just like using the shadow app on a computer. so it’s hard to say whether you need the shadow ghost or not. it depends on your setup at home and how you plan to use the service. last summer, blade planned to manufacture 5,000 units. but now that the user base has grown significantly, that first batch could disappear in no time. it is available starting today for $140. a gold rush cloud gaming is a hot space right now. while some companies have been experimenting with this concept for a while (nvidia, sony), it feels like everyone is working on a new service of some sort. maybe the next xbox is going to be about streaming a game from a data center. maybe amazon will offer a game library in the cloud as part of your amazon prime subscription. emmanuel freund believes that it could be an opportunity for shadow. everybody is going to talk about cloud gaming if apple and google announce new services. but the startup has years of experiences in the space and has tried hard to compensate when it comes to latency and internet speeds. it’s going to be harder to compete on content though. game publishers and console manufacturers could start releasing exclusive titles on their cloud gaming services. that’s why blade is thinking about new gaming experiences and exclusive content that would make shadow more than a technical service.

"this weekend, the trump administration shed more light on the “american a.i. initiative,” a plan the president is set to sign today, in hopes of helping keep the u.s. at the forefront of innovation. the executive order highlights, in its own words, “bold, decisive actions” for maintaining american’s role in developing the artificial intelligence set to touch every aspect of modern life. such initiatives are both welcome and needed, but, as the new york times and others have noted, the plan lacks some key details on how it will accomplish this. the list of omissions includes, perhaps most notably, any new funding to help accomplish any of this. setting aside money for things like r&d is a key aspect in assuring that this sort of thing is more than simply lip service for those concerned the country is at risk of falling behind. the move comes in the wake of several initiatives by other countries, most notably china’s 2017 ai initiative, which set aside billions to maintain its technological foothold. the plan, while vague, does get some things right. better educating the american workforce is a key part of bracing for the seismic changes such technology will bring. the initiative is a decent first step, but the government is going to have to invest more in order to build its technology natively, as companies like google, amazon and microsoft gain increasing public pushback for contracted jobs with the state."
"google, as well as many other companies, has long relied on wikipedia for its content. now, google and google.org are giving back. google.org president jacquelline fuller today announced a $2 million contribution to the wikimedia endowment. an additional $1.1 million donation went to the wikimedia foundation, courtesy of a campaign where google employees decided where to direct google’s donation dollars. the wikimedia foundation is the nonprofit organization behind wikipedia, while the endowment is the fund. “google and wikimedia each play a unique role in an internet that works for and reflects the diversity of its users,” the wikimedia foundation wrote in a blog post. “we look forward to continuing our work with google in close collaboration with our communities around the world.” in addition to the donation, google and wikipedia are expanding project tiger, an initiative to expand the content on wikipedia into additional languages. the pilot program has already increased the amount of locally relevant content in 12 indic languages. with the expansion, the goal is to include 10 more languages. “while efforts to empower editors will help them continue to add more information and knowledge to the web, we also aim to support the long-term health of the wikimedia projects so they are available for generations to come,” fuller wrote in a blog post. in march, google’s youtube decided to try to combat conspiracy videos with information sourced from wikipedia. at the time, wikimedia executive director katherine maher noted it’d be nice if the corporations that use wikipedia would give back. “we want people all over the world to use, share, add to, and remix wikipedia,” maher said at the time. “at the same time, we encourage companies who use wikimedia’s content to give back in the spirit of sustainability.” google has made contributions to wikimedia before — to the sum of more than $7.5 million in total. in 2010, for example, google gave a $2 million grant to the wikimedia foundation. but this is the first time google has donated to the wikimedia endowment, which supports wikimedia’s long-term success. it’s worth noting that google is not the only corporation that has given back to the wikimedia foundation. late last year, amazon, acknowledging how its alexa voice assistants rely heavily on information from wikipedia, donated $1 million to the wikimedia endowment."
"amazon’s recent investments in nyc educational initiatives will continue, despite the company pulling its hq2 plans for the area. but the company isn’t stopping there. today, amazon announced it will bring computer science courses to more than 1,000 high schools in all 50 states and the district of columbia. the classes, which are funded through amazon’s future engineer program, will reach tens of thousands of students nationwide. the future engineer program’s goal is to bring computer science courses to more than 100,000 underprivileged kids in 2,000 low-income high schools across the u.s. it also awards 100 students per year with four-year $10,000 scholarships and offers internships at amazon. the u.s. high schools will offer the intro to computer science and ap computer science classes through the curriculum provider edhesive, says amazon. the funding will provide the lessons, tutorials, professional development for teachers, a fully sequenced and paced digital curriculum for students and live online support for both students and teachers alike. all students in the courses also receive a membership to aws educate, which gives them free computing power in the aws cloud for their class projects and other content to learn about cloud computing. while amazon obviously has a vested interest in ensuring the next generation of engineers are learning its own technologies, including aws, investments like this help to level the playing field some by offering more students the opportunity to study computer science — which can lead to their ability to get into higher-paying jobs down the road, including those outside of amazon. the amazon future engineer program itself is part of amazon’s larger $50 million investment in computer science and stem education. amazon notes that there will be 1.4 million computer science jobs available by 2020, according to the bureau of labor statistics, but only 400,000 computer science grads with the skills needed to apply for them. computer science is also the fastest-growing stem profession, but only 8 percent of stem grads are earning a computer science degree. and only a small fraction of those are from underprivileged background, amazon says. “we want to ensure that every child, especially those from underprivileged communities, has an opportunity to study computer science,” said jeff wilke, ceo worldwide consumer, amazon, in a statement. “we are excited more than 1,000 schools will now provide these courses, and look forward to adding 1,000 more schools over the coming months.”"

"tv provider dish is more tightly integrating its hopper line of receivers with google assistant by integrating the smart assistant directly into its set-top boxes. the company was already working with google on a voice-controlled experience, having announced a year ago at ces that it would allow customers to control their dish tv experience using google assistant. however, in that case, dish customers had to first pair their hopper devices with an existing google assistant device in their home. this new development, announced today at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, is integrating the google assistant technology directly into the hopper hardware itself. that means dish subscribers will be able to use their dish voice remote to talk to google assistant in order to control their dish tv. they can also search for tv content by channel, title, actor or genre. dish tv viewers will be able to do other things with google assistant, too — like check the weather, get news updates, display photos and control their other connected devices around the home.the new feature, the company hopes, will make dish’s tv service more compelling in a day and age where many consumers are cutting the cord with pay tv and turning to streaming media devices like apple tv, fire tv, android tv and roku — all of which now have their own voice control and voice search capabilities. dish isn’t only working with google for voice control. in fact, it was one of the first to leverage amazon alexa for hands-free voice control of its hopper and wally receivers back in 2017. however, the alexa integration was limited to pairing the dish receiver with alexa through an alexa skill."
"you’d be forgiven for not knowing amazon has operated in china for more than a decade, but perhaps not for much longer. the company is reportedly in talks to merge its china-based import business with local peer kaola, the cross-border shopping platform run by chinese internet behemoth netease, caijing reported (link in chinese) on tuesday. the deal, which netease initiated and will occur through a stock swap, had been signed at the end of 2018 but negotiations had been difficult, sources told caijing. the timing of the marriage is interesting as amazon recently snagged a deal with western union to better serve unbanked shoppers across asia (which did not include mainland china). amazon also connects chinese sellers to consumers worldwide, and just last week, worldfirst, a london-based payments firm that relies heavily on working with amazon small and medium-sized merchants, a direct rival to amazon. according to caijing, the netease merger won’t affect amazon’s export-led unit. netease kaola declined to comment on the matter. [update: amazon also declined to comment.] amazon, western union debut paycode to sell goods in emerging markets and let shoppers pay in cash amazon entered china in 2004 after it bought out local book-selling business joyo for $75 million. in 2014, it started offering an overseas shopping service to capture chinese consumers’ growing appetite for imported goods. since then the titan has devised various marketing gimmicks — including its annual black friday campaign — to lure shoppers, but the business was never able to establish a commanding position in china, where big guns like alibaba and jd.com dominate. according to research firm iresearch, amazon held less than 1 percent of the chinese commerce market in 2016. within the arena of imports, amazon china claimed about 6 percent share by the second quarter of 2018, while alibaba’s tmall global took the lead at 29 percent, per data from research company analysys. netease kaola and jd.com trailed behind at 22.6 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively. despite a weak presence in china, amazon’s massive global reach could be a coveted asset for its local rivals. “netease needs to procure more inventory and it’s hard because they don’t do marketing as well as alibaba overseas,” ivy shen, vice president with shenzhen-based cross-border e-commerce startup azoya, told techcrunch. “kaola is also opening more offline stores so it might need more capital to expand, and amazon can provide that capital. the cross-border market isn’t big enough for amazon, but offline retail could be,” added shen. netease is best-known as china’s second-largest game publisher after tencent, but its success dates back to the pc-era where it ran a popular news portal and email business. the hangzhou-based company has over the years been re-inventing itself, leaping into a broad range of ventures, including music streaming, a segment that rivals tencent’s qq music; comics, which it sold to bilibili, an anime streaming business backed by tencent and alibaba; and e-commerce, a unit that has driven much of its growth recently and contributed about 27 percent of its overall revenues during the latest quarter."
"if you’re like me, you let out a heavy sigh every month or so when you reach out and unexpectedly find an empty bag of coffee. bottomless, one of the 200-plus startups in y combinator’s latest batch, has a solution for us caffeine addicts. for a $36 annual membership fee, a cost which co-founder michael mayer says isn’t set in stone, plus $11.29 per order depending on the blend, bottomless will automatically restock your coffee supply before you run out. how? the startup sends its members an internet-connected scale free of charge, which members place under their bag of coffee grounds. tracking the weight of the bag, bottomless’ scales determine when customers are low on grounds and ensure a new bag of previously selected freshly roasted coffee is on their doorstep before they run out. voilà, no more coffee-less mornings. founded by seattle-based husband and wife duo mayer and liana herrera in 2016, bottomless began as a passion project for mayer, a former developer at nike.com. herrera kept working as a systems implementations specialist until bottomless secured enough customers to justify the pair working on the project full-time. that was in 2018; months later, after their second attempt at applying, they were admitted into the y combinator accelerator program. bottomless’ smart scale bottomless today counts around 400 customers and has inked distribution deals with four barrel and philz coffee, among other roasters. including the $150,000 investment yc provides each of its startups, bottomless previously raised a pre-seed round from san francisco and seattle-area angel investors. before relocating to san francisco for yc, the bottomless founders were working feverishly out of their seattle home. “this whole time we’ve been 3d-printing prototypes out of our apartment and soldering them together out of our apartment,” mayer told techcrunch. “we kind of turned our place into this new manufacturing facility. there’s dust everywhere and it’s crazy. but we made 150 units ourselves by hand-soldering and lots of burned fingers.” the long-term goal is to automate the restocking process of several household items, like pet food, soap and shampoo. their challenge will be getting customers to keep multiple smart scales in their homes as opposed to just asking their digital assistant to order them some coffee or soap on amazon . amazon recently announced it was doing away with its stick-on dash buttons, iot devices capable of self-ordering on amazon. the devices launched in 2015 before google homes and amazon alexas hit the mainstream. so why keep a smart scale in your kitchen as opposed to just asking a digital assistant to replenish your supply? mayer says it’s coffee quality that keeps it competitive. “some of our most enthusiastic customers live out in like deep suburbs far away from city centers, but they really love fresh coffee,” mayer said. “and there’s no way to get fresh coffee if you live 20 or 30 minutes from a city center, right?” “or you might think in a city like san francisco or seattle, you can get freshly roasted coffee pretty easily because there are restaurants all over the place, right?” he added. “that’s certainly true, but it does take a little bit of extra thought to remember to grab it on the right day when you’re running low.” mayer and herrera don’t consider themselves coffee experts, despite now running what is essentially a direct-to-consumer coffee marketplace out of seattle, the coffee capital. “i’m originally from portland and portlanders know a lot about coffee,” mayer said. “i never really considered myself to be a coffee aficionado or a coffee snob in my head, but i guess compared to like the average american from anywhere in the country, i would be just a regular coffee drinker in portland. all i really knew about coffee going into this was that it’s better fresh. that’s it.” bottomless is currently accepting customers in beta. the team will pitch to investors at yc demo days next week."
"after launching apparently successful pilot runs in san francisco and new york, ups announced today plans to expand its in-building delivery service to 10 additional u.s. cities. in mid-2019, the parcel service will be adding atlanta, chicago, los angeles, houston, dallas, washington, d.c., philadelphia, boston, miami and seattle. ups’s program was launched last summer, utilizing smart locks designed by new york-based startup, latch. the initial roll out was a clear attempt by ups to take on amazon’s own efforts in the space. key by amazon started as an in-house delivery service partnership with kwikset, which has since expanded to included cars, businesses and garages. ups service is designed to let delivery people enter into common areas, rather than individual apartments, so they can leave packages in lobbies and foyers when residents are out. latch currently has a sign up form on its site for those interested in taking part in the program. the move is another key win for latch, which has been carving out a name for itself in the crowded smart lock space, through deals with retailers like jet and a recent $70 million raise."

"google assistant is following amazon alexa into vehicles. one of the first products to offer the capability is from anker — just like as one of the first in-vehicle alexa products. called the roav bolt, the device plugs into a 12-volt power port and lets the driver access google assistant through the “ok google” command. once connected to the in-vehicle system through bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable, the product will let drivers play audio, enable navigation, read text, make calls and more. the roav bolt also has two usb ports for recharging devices. i tried the roav viva a year ago and found the system clunky to configure and a pain to use. also, at the time, alexa lacked features that made it compelling to use in a vehicle and the third-party device lacked some functionality, like support for spotify. this time around with google assistant, it’s likely the roav bolt offers enough features to make it more worthwhile for more people. this seems like an easy way to get the power of google into a car. the roav bolt will be available for purchase in february for $49.99."
"flipkart co-founder binny bansal’s next act is aimed at helping the next generation of startup founders in india. bansal already etched his name into india’s startup history after u.s. retail giant walmart paid $16 billion to take a majority stake in flipkart’s e-commerce business to expand its rivalry with amazon. things turned sour, however, when he resigned months after the deal’s completion due to an investigation into “serious personal misconduct.” in 2019, 37-year-old bansal is focused on his newest endeavor, xto10x technologies, a startup consultancy that he founded with former colleague saikiran krishnamurthy. the goal is to help startup founders on a larger scale than the executive could ever do on his own. “person to person, i can help 10 startups, but the ambition is to help 10,000 early and mid-stage entrepreneurs, not 10,” bansal told bloomberg in an interview. bansal, who started flipkart in 2007 with sachin bansal (no relation) and still retains a four percent share, told bloomberg that india-based founders are bereft of quality consultancy and software services to handle growth and company building. “today, software is built for large enterprises and not small startups,” he told the publication. “think of it as solving for startups what amazon web services has done for computing, helping enterprises go from zero to a thousand servers overnight with no hassle.” “instead of making a thousand mistakes, if we can help other startups make a hundred or even a few hundred, that would be worth it,” bansal added. bansal served as flipkart’s ceo from 2007 to 2016 before becoming ceo of the flipkart group. he declined to go into specifics of the complaint against him at flipkart — which reports suggest came about from a consensual relationship with a female employee — and, of the breakdown of his relationship with sachin bansal, he said he’s moved on to new things. it isn’t just xto10x technologies that is keeping him busy. bansal is involved in investment firm 021 capital, where he is the lead backer following a $50 million injection. neither role at the two companies involves day-to-day operations, bloomberg reported, but, still, bansal is seeding his money and experience to shape the indian startup ecosystem."
"target this morning announced target+, a new initiative designed to expand the assortment on target.com with merchandise from third-party sellers. but unlike with walmart and amazon’s marketplaces, target is taking a more curated approach as to how sellers will be added to its program. the retailer says it’s starting with “thoughtfully selected” additions in areas like home, toys, electronics and sporting goods. while any seller can apply to join amazon or walmart’s marketplace, there’s no such process for joining target+. instead, target explains that each partner is “carefully selected” and then invited into the program — a move it hopes will help keep quality high. at launch, guests will be able to discover an expanded array of running shoes, outdoor décor, patio accessories, a bigger selection of stem learning toys, new musical instruments and baseball gear from both national and specialty sellers, says target. some of the current sellers include: svsports, mizuno, kaplan early learning company, serenity health & home décor and music123. over time, more products and sellers will be added, as target learns more about guest needs. offering only a curated selection means target+ won’t face the same struggles as other retailers when it comes to policing their third-party marketplaces for offensive content — like the racist merchandise found on amazon, for instance; the toilet seat covers featuring holy text; politically charged and controversial apparel; and other items. because these marketplaces are so large, offensive or just generally questionable or odd merchandise repeatedly surfaces, resulting in bad pr for the marketplace’s host, like amazon, walmart or ebay. target will avoid this issue by way of its curation, but it will come at the expense of having a larger third-party assortment. target+ merchandise will also be integrated into the site within the appropriate categories, so the items can be discovered through both browsing and search. there’s no way to just search for “target+” items. in addition, shoppers will have the same perks when buying from third parties as they do when buying from target’s own assortment, including 5 percent off when using their target redcard, free shipping and in-store returns. before target+, a portion of target’s assortment was shipped directly from third-party vendors, but guests were purchasing the items from target. with target+, products are purchased and shipped from the third-party vendors. “guests look to target for great products. with target +, we aim to give them easy access to even more great products by partnering with best-in-class specialty and national brands that will help guests save and get more done in just one stop to target.com,” said rick gomez, target’s chief marketing officer and digital officer, in a statement. the launch of target+ follows walmart’s recent announcement that it would expand its two-day shipping program to the millions of products offered by its own marketplace sellers, to better compete with fulfillment by amazon, which allows sellers to make their items available on prime. and, like target, walmart aims to leverage its brick-and-mortar stores for third-party merchandise returns. both moves put amazon at more of a disadvantage, as its brick-and-mortar footprint is limited to its whole foods stores, and various bookstores and other shops in urban metros. walmart, on the other hand, has 140 million weekly in-store customers, and says 90 percent of americans live within 10 miles of a walmart store. target, meanwhile, has 1,850 retail stores in the u.s. compared with roughly 475 whole foods stores in the u.s., and more than 4,700 walmart locations in the u.s. (excluding sam’s club)."
"ces crowds can be tough — especially toward the end of the week. you’re physically and emotionally drained, and you’re pretty sure you’ve seen everything the consumer electronics world has to offer. and then something comes along to knock your socks off. square off was one such product, impressing the crowd at our meetup and walking away the winner of our hardware pitch-off. the company’s first product looks like your run of the mill wooden chess board. and that’s part of the charm. turn it on with the single button, and the system goes to work, tapping into chess ai software built by stockfish and moving opposing pieces accordingly with an electromagnet attached to a robotic arm hidden under the board. it’s an overused word in this space, but the effect is downright magical. it’s like playing chess against a ghost — and who hasn’t wanted to do that at some point? players can challenge the board using 20 different difficulty levels or can play against opponents remotely, via chess.com. bhavya gohil, the co-founder and ceo of square off creator infivention, told techcrunch that the product started life as a college project aimed at creating a chess board for people with visual impairment. after a trip to maker faire rome, however, its inventors recognized that the product had the potential for broader appeal. one kickstarter and another indiegogo campaign later, the company had raised in excess of $600,000 for the project. after a year learning the manufacturing ropes in china, the company began shipping retail products in march of last year, launching a website the following month. in october, the product landed on amazon, tripling sales for the holiday. all told, the company has sold 9,000 units — not bad for a chess startup charging $369 a pop. a majority of those (80 percent) have been sold in the u.s., with the remainder being sold in europe. in november, the company scored a seed round of $1.1 million. infivention is planning version 2.0 for a mid-2020 launch. that one will be more versatile, covering additional classic table-top games like checkers and backgammon. that version will be even more versatile when it’s opened up to table-top game developers looking to build their own titles into the platform via the app."
"amazon’s formidable presence in the world of retail stems partly from the fact that it’s just not a commerce giant, it’s also a tech company — building solutions and platforms in-house that make its processes, from figuring out what to sell, to how much to have on hand and how best to distribute it, more efficient and smarter than those of its competition. now, one of the startups that is building retail technology to help those that are not amazon compete better with it, has raised a significant round of funding to meet that challenge. relex — a company out of finland that focuses on retail planning solutions by helping both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce companies make better forecasts of how products will sell using ai and machine learning, and in turn giving those retailers guidance on how and what should be stocked for purchasing — is today announcing that it has raised $200 million from tcv. the vc giant — which has backed iconic companies like facebook, airbnb, netflix, spotify and splunk — last week announced a new $3 billion fund, and this is the first investment out of it that is being made public. relex is not disclosing its valuation, but from what i understand it’s a minority stake, which would put it at between $400 million and $500 million. the company has been around for a few years but has largely been very capital-efficient, raising only between $20 million and $30 million before this from summit partners, with much of that sum still in the bank. that lack of song and dance around vc funding also helped keep the company relatively under the radar, even while it has quietly grown to work with customers like supermarkets albertsons in the u.s., morrisons in the u.k. and a host of others. business today is mostly in north america and europe, with the u.s. growing the fastest, ceo mikko kärkkäinen — who co-founded the company with johanna småros and michael falck — said in an interview. while the company has already been growing at a steady clip — kärkkäinen said sales have been expanding by 50 percent each year for a while now — the plan now will be to accelerate that. relex competes with management systems from sap, jda and oracle, but kärkkäinen said that these are largely “legacy” solutions, in that they do not take advantage of advances in areas like machine learning and cloud computing — both of which form the core of what relex uses — to crunch more data more intelligently. “most retailers are not tech companies, and relex is a clear leader among a lot of legacy players,” said tcv general partner john doran, who led the deal. significantly, that’s an approach that the elephant in the room pioneered and has used to great effect, becoming one of the biggest companies in the world. “amazon has driven quite a lot of change in the industry,” kärkkäinen said (he’s very typically finnish and understated). “but we like to see ourselves as an antidote to amazon.” brick-and-mortar stores are an obvious target for a company like relex, given that shelf space and real estate are costs that these kinds of retailers have to grapple with more than online sellers. but in fact kärkkäinen said that e-commerce companies (given that’s also where amazon primarily operates too) have been an equal target and customer base. “for these, we might be the only solution they have purchased that has not been developed in-house.” the funding will be used in two ways. first, to give the company’s sales a boost, especially in the u.s., where business is growing the fastest at the moment. and second, to develop more services on its current platform. for example, the focus up to now has been on-demand forecasting, kärkkäinen said, and how that effects prices and supply, but it would like to expand its coverage also to labor optimisation alongside that; in other words, how best to staff a business according to forecasts and demands. of course, while amazon is the big competition for all retailers, they potentially also exist as a partner. the company regularly productizes its own in-house services, and it will be interesting to see how and if that translates to amazon emerging as a competitor to relex down the line."

"three cities, three dead urban unicorn renewal projects. in just the past few days, we’ve had foxconn renege on wisconsin, amazon renege on nyc and ge renege on boston. each followed the anna karenina principle that every unhappy economic development deal is unhappy in its own way: for foxconn, it was trade tariffs and slowing iphone sales; for amazon, it was populist protests plus the usual nyc corruption; for ge, it was the reality of looking at a mirror and finding that you’re staring at a dumpster fire. yet, there are eerie similarities, other than the fact that i have practically lived next door to every single one of these projects (if you call wisconsin next door to the better-looking state of minnesota). you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. in each case, there was the perfect alchemy of the modern urban unicorn renewal plan. a well-known but sordid tech company paints a picture of revolutionizing a city’s economic base. they splash huge numbers on the board, or at least a coveted status symbol. seeing their legacies secured, politicians latch on to these projects, negotiating with alacrity and without due process because — wow — the company with suicide nets or the company where employees pee in bottles (undercover!) is coming to town. i get it. and look, if these projects panned out, they would indeed be great for their home cities. as i wrote about amazon hq2 a few weeks ago: these spillover effects are at the heart of agglomeration economies. with amazon’s arrival, more software engineers will locate to nyc. they will start companies, join other tech firms and expand the vitality of the community. as edward glaeser argues convincingly in his book the triumph of the city, density of talent matters enormously for the success of the city. amazon thickens the market for tech talent, and that is a huge win for both nyc and dc. yet, these projects rarely work out, and behind this all is the plague of silicon everywhere. as i wrote four years ago: there are many commentators who argue that there is a bubble in silicon valley today. they may or may not be right, but there is certainly a bubble in places named after the preeminent global tech ecosystem. silicon border. silicon hills. silicon steppe. silicon prairie. silicon roundabout. silicon gulf. silicon avenue. silicon canal. silicon alley. silicon beach. silicon forest. philadelphia has a groaner of a region with philicon valley (whoever invented this should be banished from marketing for five years or forced to market path). and so we got “wisconn valley,” which actually is a brilliant fusion of foxconn, silicon and wisconsin that now has its very own government homepage. ge was going to restart boston’s tech scene, except the 800 jobs in its headquarters office were predominantly accountants and lawyers, which of course is where the real innovation of any company takes place. these silicon dreams need to be crushed, beaten, stamped out and destroyed. so should these mega-project economic development deals, which always seem to go through a cycle from euphoria to lassitude. in their wake, tech leaders should be encouraging a culture of bottoms-up economic development. mayors should partner with local startups to encourage the growth of small companies and then coordinate pathways to help them succeed. economic development money should turn into seed capital, boot camp credits, university research transfer grants and a whole lot more options for small-scale — human-scale — interventions. the unicorn urban renewal project is dead, but it always has been. welcome to the extra crunch daily image via flickr by prayitno used under

resilience startups, the disappearing form d filing, softbank’s debt obsession, the internet’s transformation into a nation state and why techcrunch’s parent company is … well, i shouldn’t say that, lest i kick that damn hornet’s nest again. this newsletter is about context, big ideas and arguments. it’s also about touching on any of the 35-odd spaces that i seem to cover in a given day, so it’s basically professional adhd in written format. i write when i am in that liminal space between curiosity and anger, that “why??” which follows “what!!!” i’m joined on this project by arman tabatabai, our intrepid research consultant from new york. he’s always willing to learn a completely new subject because i had a dream last night (monday morning at 8am: “so what do you know about geoengineering?”), and for that he’s amazing and this newsletter couldn’t go on without him. patreon ec-1 and the challenge of private companies we debuted extra crunch this week with the launch of patreon’s ec-1. i was inspired by the s-1 that companies file with the sec when going public and thought: “why don’t we do that, but for private companies.” a couple of hundred hours later, and that’s basically what we got with this first edition. with patreon, techcrunch’s media columnist eric peckham wrote a bonanza of analysis on the company’s founding story, product, business, thesis and competition, and he even threw in a reading guide so you can read everyone else’s coverage of the company. there are pretty generous pours of these articles in front of the paywall too, so do share them with colleagues. the hope is that these projects can spark the imagination, give ideas around strategies and tactics that might work in a startup context and, of course, help evaluate the future of the company we are holding under the microscope. we have three other companies in the hopper right now coming up in this series. have ones you want to see covered? think there could be an interesting deep dive we are missing? hit reply and tell me — right now — or send me an email at danny@techcrunch.com. obsessions this is an open agenda that i use to track what the hell i am writing about on a regular basis. we are going to be talking india here, focused around the book “billionaire raj” by james crabtree. we have a lot to catch up on in the china world when the ec launch craziness dies down. plus, we are covering the next factory of the world by irene yuan sun. societal resilience and geoengineering are still top-of-mind. some more on metrics design and quantification. thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york. you’re reading the extra crunch daily.

"once upon a time, people had to wait for the super bowl to watch the ads. those dark days are over. now you can have companies sell you products on-demand, any time, day or night. amazon has already debuted its latest alexa ad, and now microsoft’s getting in on the action — and this one’s a bit of a tear-jerker. the software giant’s super bowl spot highlights some of the work it’s done to increase the accessibility of its products. front and center is the xbox adaptive controller, a $100 ad-on that makes the console more accessible to gamers with a range of different needs. the spot features a number of different children (and their parents) who are better able to enjoy gaming using the device.  the adaptive controller was created with input from a number of different groups, including the ablegamers charity, the cerebral palsy foundation, specialeffect and warfighter engaged, and tested with help from various users. on top of its base functionality with two large pads, it also works with a number of different control inputs, which can be plugged into the rear of the product."
"rackspace, the hosted private cloud vendor, let go around 200 workers or 3 percent of its worldwide workforce of 6,600 employees this week. the company says that it’s part of a recalibration where it is trying to find workers who are better suited to their current business approach. a rackspace spokesperson told techcrunch that it is “a stable and profitable company.” in fact, it hired 1,500 employees in 2018 and currently has 200 job openings. “we continue to invest in our business based on market opportunity and our customers’ needs – we take actions on an ongoing basis in some areas where we are over-invested and hire in areas where we are under invested,” a company spokesperson explained. the company, which went public in 2008 and private again for $4.3 billion in 2016, has struggled in a cloud market dominated by giants like amazon, microsoft and google, but according to synergy research, a firm that keeps close watch on the cloud market, it is one of the top three companies in the hosted private cloud category. it’s worth noting that the top company in this category is ibm, and rackspace could be a good target for big blue if it wanted to use its checkbook to get a boost in market share. ibm is in third or fourth place in the cloud infrastructure market, depending on whose numbers you look at, but it could move the needle a bit by buying a company like rackspace. neither company is suggesting this, however, and ibm bought red hat at the end of last year for $34 billion, making it less likely it will be in a spending mood this year. for now the layoffs appear to be a company tweaking its workforce to meet current market conditions, but whatever the reason, it’s never a happy day when people lose their jobs. rackspace to go private after $4.3b acquisition by private equity firm apollo"
"as schools continue to look for new ways to cut costs while at the same time reboot their curriculum to better tap new innovations and improved understandings of how children learn, e-learning startups are attracting attention, both from educators and the vcs that fund them to fuel growth. in the latest development, newsela — which has created a platform that packages together different third-party content like primary-source documents, news articles and more to help teachers and students learn about a particular subject, more or less as a replacement for more traditional textbooks — has announced that it has raised $50 million in a series c round of funding led by tcv. the new york-based startup said that it plans to use the money to get more penetration within the schools where it is already being used, as well as continue expanding the subject areas that it covers. the company — which currently focuses primarily on k-12 but does cover other learning environments like english-as-a-second-language courses and adult education — covers mostly social sciences, science and english, but also some math. it currently has more than 20 million students and 1.8 million teachers using its the platform, and says that it has usage already in some 90 percent of all schools in the us. the startup is not talking valuation, but as a rough guide, prior to this, newsela had raised about $38 million and was valued at about $82 million in its previous round, according to pitchbook, with some notable backers already on its cap table, including the chan zuckerberg initiative and kleiner perkins, as well as education-focused funds like owl ventures, reach capital and new schools venture fund. it’s a long way to come for a company that was founded, matthew gross (ceo) and dan cogan-drew (the chief product officer), two educators who cut their teeth working in more traditional environments, including via teach for america. newsela first got its start, as you might guess from the name, aggregating interesting news articles that could be used to supplement learning plans around particular subjects, with a specific focus on “ela” — english and language arts. it was after a year in beta that it started to see that there was potential to expand outside of that focus and into adjacent areas. “we’ve outgrown our name,” gross said. the company, founded in 2012, was born out of the idea that computers — used not just for learning coding, but for doing research and communications — have become a cornerstone of how children get information today in the classroom. broadband penetration in schools is now at over 90 percent (compared to 30 percent when newsela first started). and with many schools in the us already equipping each student with a dedicated laptop, that presented an opportunity to rethink how they could be used to harness a wider and more fluid set of materials than what students might be able to get out of a traditional textbook. the material shift in learning comes at a time when we are tapping the internet as the first port of call for all our information outside the classroom. we carry a library in our pockets, and those in a classroom can use their screens to view the us constitution, a specific work of art, the sequence of battles in the civil war and writings from people at the time, modern takes on what a financial crisis in the past might have indicated, or new scientific discoveries. “we can see an unprecedented opportunity to rethink content,” gross said. “textbooks are being pushed aside, and even where they are still being used, many are no longer making textbooks core curricular purchases.” and the shift to interactive also means that other things can now also be measured. “educators are looking for more engagement in their learning outcomes,” he added. indeed, that has had a big knock-on effect already in the textbook publishing world. just last month, pearson sold its entire k-12 textbook division to a pe firm, nexus capital management, in a fire sale: for $25 million plus $225 million in the form of a vendor note due in the next three to five years, with the understanding that nexus may also sell it (in which case pearson would get a cut). pearson said that it will be focusing its education publishing efforts now on digital. gross estimated to me that the textbook market, however, is a $10 billion business annually in terms of collective budgets that are allocated for buying them, which represents a big market for it — and others looking to replace textbooks, including the publishers themselves — to tackle. the format that newsela follows is flexible depending on what is needed by the customer (the school): it provides a set of materials that are constructed around learning a particular subject. but it doesn’t create the coursework around that: this is left to teachers, departments, schools and districts to build. sometimes a district will provide newsela with a more targeted request of what it would like to see covered, and newsela will build a collection to those parameters, gross told me. that is one area it wants to grow. what newsela does behind the scenes is work with more than 100 different sources that have inked licensing agreements with the startup. the licenses allow newsela to republish content on its own platform, and also rewrite content into five levels that are adaptive to age, reading ability and so on. it’s work that would be very time-consuming, and potentially expensive (or even cost-prohibitive), for individual teachers, schools and districts to do on their own. working with a team of editors, newsela gives educators the assurance that there has been some vetting done to provide accurate and complete sets of materials. “it’s a wild world when they search in a google box,” gross said of the challenges to be able to predict a consistent level of quality in results and resources when people sometimes turn to the internet to build similar bundles of content on their own. all of this comes at a price. there is a free tier of newsela that provides the ability to browse and assign content; create classes and give students access to that content, alongside quizzes and activities. two further paid tiers provide a number of extra features. one, teacher-focused, covers monitoring reading activity and quiz scores, assignment planning, annotations, writing prompts, and more teaching resources. the second aimed at schools and districts adds admin visibility, teacher training, live support, and more customised learning plans. in both paid tiers, newsela does not publicly disclose pricing.  the expansiveness of the platform, and future potential of where it can go, are two reasons why tcv — which has backed the likes of capella education, open english and varsity tutors in the education sector, but also very huge consumer internet startups like airbnb, facebook, linkedin and netflix — was interested in backing newsela. “at tcv we focus on finding transformative edtech companies, and newsela has proven to be a tool that boosts learning outcomes,” said woody marshall, general partner at tcv, in a statement. “our investment will help extend the platform and make it more accessible and even more valuable to students, teachers, and administrators. we are especially excited by the great engagement and feedback that newsela already has with their users.” marshall is joining the board with this round. newsela is far from being the only edtech startup that has tapped money from the vc world to grow. in the k-12 sector alone, others have included byju’s in india, which is now valued at over $4 billion (and just this week appears to have started to raise more money from tencent and general atlantic); classdojo; age of learning; vipkid, and kahoot to expand their businesses amid a surge of interest from students, parents and teachers. at newsela, meanwhile, gross said the startup is hiring and has grown staff 50 percent in the last year, and expects to grow as much again this year. “we might have attracted more interest if we had raised $100 million instead of $50 million,” he said in a comment about what seems to turn people’s heads in the tech world these days, “but we happen to be a very capital efficient business, and we heeded a warning i got early on not to raise more than what you really need. we’re proud of being a fiscally sound business that is also mission driven, and making an impact.” that doesn’t rule out raising more for m&a, he added, or indeed fielding inbound interest themselves: the company has already been approached by interested parties, although he declined to say who. but when you consider that education publishers are all looking for their next move to serve the classroom of the future; and tech companies like google, amazon, apple and microsoft have all made huge plays to court the education sector, the longer-term picture is a bright one for newsela."
"amazon has hired disney svp kyle laughlin to head its alexa gadgets division, techcrunch has learned. laughlin spent eight years at disney, most recently as the svp and general manager of games, apps and connected experience at the entertainment giant’s consumer products and interactive media division. according to his linkedin profile, the role found laughlin overseeing apps, connected hardware and games for disney and lucasfilm. the gig also involved ai, iot and ar/vr. also, lots of muppets. amazon has since confirmed the hire. a spokesperson for the company told techcrunch, “i can confirm that kyle laughlin has joined amazon as director, alexa gadgets. we’re very excited to have him.” the gig appears to revolve around the newly defined “alexa gadget” category, which the company describes as “fun and delightful accessories that pair to compatible echo devices via bluetooth.” doesn’t seem like much of a stretch after eight years at disney. examples of current alexa gadgets include the echo wall clock and gemmy industries’ connected big mouth billy bass and dancing plush animatronics. in a few short years, the echo has transformed from smart speaker to a category-defining, industry-driving project. alexa has become a huge business for amazon and left everyone else struggling to catch up. alexa gadgets is a big push from amazon to grow the smart assistant’s ecosystem beyond the smart speaker, through a wide range of connected devices."
"as comcast continues to hone its ambitions to be the hub around which our many connected devices and services revolve in your home, and intel continues to build smaller, faster and more efficient chips, the two are announcing a key deal to give comcast an edge over the likes of amazon, google and the field of other home broadband providers. today at ces — alongside new 9th generation chips, a new integrated, a hybrid “3d” chip in a new project called lakefield, and its ice lake 10nm chips —  intel said it would collaborate with comcast on devices and services to enable super-fast broadband speeds of 10 gigabits per second (a new priority for intel) for its xfinity broadband service, as well as in-home wifi 6, aka 802.11ax, the newest, faster wifi standard that requires less energy to work, and sits as an alternative to 5g for iot connectivity. in an interview earlier today, tony werner, the president of technology, product and “xperience” at comcast cable, said this latest partnership — the two have worked on technologies and projects before — will see intel providing comcast with tech for its xfi advanced gateways to work with 8th generation intel core processors for pcs and other devices, which were launched in august last year. (financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed at this time, the companies said.) the tech will come by way of intel’s puma system on a chip — yes, the same one that saw a lot of controversy because of a bug that let malicious hackers massively slow down the performance of a modem running 5th, 6th and 7th generations of the chip (a firmware update ultimately fixed the flaw). the first devices that will be able to work with the faster speeds are expected to be rolled out in 2019, while comcast expects its first 10 gig and wifi 6 services will come in 2020 — just in time for the olympics, which both companies happen to sponsor. (to be specific, that’s service availability: it’s not clear how long it will take for consumers to want the faster speeds. comcast rolled out 1 gigabit xfinity broadband in 2016 and werner said the service now extends across 58 million people, but he declined to say how many of those are actually using the service.) the opportunity that comcast and intel are hoping to connect with has to do with how we use the internet today, and how that is expected to develop in the years ahead. many individuals and homes already have multiple connected devices beyond a phone and computer — that includes any number of “smart home” devices that you can control or monitor by way of an app as well as smart watches and more. according to estimates from cisco, that figure is expected to balloon by 2022 to 13.4 connected devices on average per person. then there is what we’re doing with those devices: video and streaming are the name of the game today, and as speeds have started to get faster and more reliable, and devices have gotten better, people have come to expect more of these services, such as faster performance, better and more immersive video, and the ability to upload video (of yourself!) as much as to be able to stream down content. “look at the rise of gaming and e-sports, where players want to create content and stream with friends as much as play,” said gregory bryant, intel svp and gm of the client computing group in an interview. “those are the usage models and applications that need low latency and are becoming more mainstream.” he also pointed out that another big strain on home networks is the fact that multiple people may be doing multiple things simultaneously: it’s no longer about the family crowded around one tv set in the living room. “it’s about personal broadcasting,” he said. other content that would become more user-friendly with the faster network speeds includes 4k video, “volumetric” 3d video and other immersive content.  comcast has an obvious competitive drive to create faster and more efficient networks — consumers now have multiple choices for how to connect up their homes, not just in terms of who provides the hub, but also who provides the content that runs on the hub, who provides the connectivity to the hub, and even what kind of connectivity you might choose to use, including 5g or something else. but the deal is an important one for intel, too. bryant said that while intel works with a number of carrier partners to provide tech for their broadband gateways, this work with comcast is the largest and most extensive example of that. at a time when intel faces competition on a number of fronts from the likes of amd, nvidia and many others, securing a deal with a major carrier with equally major ambitions remains a lucrative way of not just generating revenues but also showing off what you are capable of doing for future customers."
"facebook’s gang that couldn’t shoot straight advertising department has made another blunder, this time by pulling elizabeth warren campaign ads touting the senator’s proposal to break up big tech. the offending ads were pulled, according to politico, over their use of the facebook brand in their copy. meanwhile, other ads that the senator’s presidential campaign had run which addressed the plan to unwind various acquisitions by facebook, amazon and alphabet (the parent company of google) were not removed from facebook. indeed, the removal appears to be short-lived, but has given the warren campaign ammunition for their argument and numerous headlines, tweets and retweets. curious why i think fb has too much power? let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether fb has too much power. thanks for restoring my posts. but i want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor. #breakupbigtech https://t.co/ups6dozoxn — elizabeth warren (@ewarren) march 11, 2019 “we removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo,” a facebook spokesperson told buzzfeed’s ryan mac. “in the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.” facebook confirms it took down elizabeth warren's ads about facebook, but is in the process of restoring them. fb spox: ""we removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo. in the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.” — ryan mac (@rmac18) march 11, 2019 that’s a good move for the facebook public relations team, especially since the ads reportedly didn’t include facebook’s logo. but the damage has already been done. it provides fodder to warren’s argument that big tech has too much power and control over the way information is disseminated — especially on its own platforms. this incident may be a tempest in a teapot, but it will calcify positions on the left and the right about the self-interest of big technology and these companies’ ability to regulate content on their own platforms to the detriment of free speech — even in advertising."
"sites like amazon and ebay have made it very compelling for consumers to buy online rather than in stores, in part because prices are very competitive and in many cases cheaper than what buyers might find in traditional retailers. but in the u.k., it turns out that some of those low prices are in part due to sellers dodging taxes, so now the government is cracking down. the u.k.’s tax authority has “red-flagged” 4,600 online merchants, from a total of 7,000 investigations, in the last two years that have been evading sales taxes on goods sold in the u.k. on major marketplace sites like amazon and ebay. many of those online stores have been shut down and deleted as a result, while those now selling to u.k. buyers legitimately are giving the u.k.’s tax coffers a £205 million ($255 million) boost. the numbers are the latest milestones in a long-term, ongoing operation by hm revenue and customs (hmrc). the authority has been working in conjunction with seven online marketplaces — amazon, ebay, fruugo.com, wolf & badger, etsy, asos and flubit — which last year signed on to cooperate in the investigation to identify merchants evading taxes by providing records of sales and other data obtained by the hmrc itself (we asked and it did not elaborate on what the latter entails). the hmrc has estimated that between £1 billion and £1.5 billion ($1.3-1.9 billion) in collections were lost in a single year (2017) by companies failing to pay sales taxes on goods, with between £600 million and £900 million of that coming from overseas sellers. the hmrc defines overseas sellers as a merchant that sells goods “in the uk to uk consumers and don’t have a business establishment in the uk.” merchants based outside the eu that sell goods to u.k. consumers and then import them to the u.k. are also overseas sellers. the joint and several liability (jsl) notices — as the red flag notices are officially called — have been around since 2016, part of a wider remit both to identify tax loss and also weed out those who might be tricking the system to the detriment of u.k. businesses. “delivering a fair and level playing field for businesses is a top priority for this government,” said financial secretary to the treasury, mel stride mp, in a statement. “these figures show that hmrc, working closely with the major online marketplaces, is making real headway tackling this serious and damaging evasion.” but the agreements signed earlier this year with marketplaces like amazon to help identify violating online sellers has given the program a boost: now, if a seller’s account does not get removed after it has been red-flagged, the marketplaces themselves become liable for any future sales taxes that the sellers incur. (it does not appear that they are liable for past taxes, though.) the hmrc said that another consequence of the operation has been a boost in vat (value-added tax, or sales tax) registrations by overseas companies. between 2017 and the end of 2018, there were 58,000 vat registration applications, compared to only 1,650 between 2015 and 2016."
"netease, china’s second-biggest online games publisher with a growing ecommerce segment, is laying off a significant number of its employees, adding to a list of chinese tech giants that have shed staff following the lunar new year. a netease employee who was recently let go confirmed with techcrunch that the company had fired a large number of people spanning multiple departments, including ecommerce, education, agriculture (yes, founder and executive officer ding lei has a thing for organic farming) and public relations, although downsizing at yanxuan, its ecommerce brand that sells private-label goods online and offline, had started before the lunar new year holiday. multiple chinese media outlets covered the layoff on wednesday. according to a report from caijing magazine, yanxuan fired 30-40 percent of its staff; the agricultural brand weiyang got a 50 percent cut; the education unit downsized from 300 to 200 employees; and 40 percent of netease’s public relations staff was gone. a spokesperson from netease evaded techcrunch’s questions about the layoff but said the company is “indeed undergoing a structural optimization to narrow its focus.” the goal, according to the person, is to “boost innovation and organizational efficiency so netease can fully play to its own strengths and adapt to market competition in the longer term.” netease ceo ding lei pictured picking longjing tea leaves in hangzhou. photo: netease yanxuan via weibo oddly, ecommerce and education appear to be some of netease’s brighter spots. the company singled them out alongside music streaming during its latest earnings call as the three sectors that saw “strong profit growth potential” and “will be the focus of [the company’s] next phase of strategic growth.” the staff cuts, then, may represent an urgency to tighten the purse strings for even netease’s rosiest businesses. the shakeup fits into market speculation about company staff cuts to save costs as china copes with a weakening domestic economy. jd.com, a rival to alibaba, is firing 10 percent of its senior management to cut costs, caixin reported last week. ride-hailing giant didi chuxing plans to let go 15 percent of its staff this year as part of a reorganization to boost internal efficiency, though it’s adding new members to focus on more promising segments. china’s didi is laying off 15% of its staff alibaba took an unexpected turn, announcing last week that it will continue to hire new talent in 2019. “we are poised to provide more resources to our platforms to help businesses navigate current environment and create more job opportunities overall,” the firm said in a statement. 2018 was a tough year for china’s games companies of all sorts. the industry took a hit after regulators froze all licensing approvals to go through a reshuffle, dragging down stock prices of big players like tencent and netease. these companies continue to feel the chill even after approvals resumed, as the newly minted regulatory body imposes stricter checks on games, slowing down the application process altogether and delaying companies’ plans to monetize lucrative new titles. that bleak domestic outlook compelled netease to take what ding dubs a “two-legged” approach to game publishing, with one foot set in china and the other extending abroad. tencent, too, has been finding new channels for its games through regional partners like sea’s garena in southeast asia. netease started in 1997 and earned its name by making pc games and providing email services in the early years of the chinese internet. more recently the company has intended to diversify its business by incubating projects across the board. it has so far enjoyed growth in segments like music streaming and ecommerce (which is reportedly swallowing up amazon china’s import-led service) while stepping back from others such as comics publishing, an asset it is selling to youth-focused video streaming site bilibili."
"a watchlist of risky individuals and corporate entities owned by dow jones has been exposed, after a company with access to the database left it on a server without a password. bob diachenko, an independent security researcher, found the amazon web services-hosted elasticsearch database exposing more than 2.4 million records of individuals or business entities. the data, since secured, is the financial giant’s watchlist database, which companies use as part of their risk and compliance efforts. other financial companies, like thomson reuters, have their own databases of high-risk clients, politically exposed persons and terrorists — but have also been exposed over the years through separate security lapses. a 2010-dated brochure billed the dow jones watchlist as allowing customers to “easily and accurately identify high-risk clients with detailed, up-to-date profiles” on any individual or company in the database. at the time, the database had 650,000 entries, the brochure said. that includes current and former politicians, individuals or companies under sanctions or convicted of high-profile financial crimes such as fraud, or anyone with links to terrorism. many of those on the list include “special interest persons,” according to the records in the exposed database seen by techcrunch. diachenko, who wrote up his findings, said the database was “indexed, tagged and searchable.” from a 2010-dated brochure of dow jones’ watchlist, which at the time had 650,000 names of individuals and entities. the exposed database had 2.4 million records. (screenshot: techcrunch) the data is all collected from public sources, such as news articles and government filings. many of the individual records were sourced from dow jones’ factiva news archive, which ingests data from many news sources — including the dow jones-owned the wall street journal. but the very inclusion of a person or company’s name, or the reason why a name exists in the database, is proprietary and closely guarded. many financial institutions and government agencies use the database to approve or deny financing, or even in the shuttering of bank accounts, the bbc previously reported. others have reported that it can take little or weak evidence to land someone on the watchlists. the records we saw vary wildly, but can include names, addresses, cities and their location, whether they are deceased or not and, in some cases, photographs. diachenko also found dates of birth and genders. each profile had extensive notes collected from factiva and other sources. one name found at random was badruddin haqqani, a commander in the haqqani guerilla insurgent network in afghanistan affiliated with the taliban. in 2012, the u.s. treasury imposed sanctions on haqqani and others for their involvement in financing terrorism. he was killed in a u.s. drone strike in pakistan months later. the database record on haqqani, who was categorized under “sanctions list” and terror,” included (and condensed for clarity): dow jones notes: killed in pakistan's north waziristan tribal area on 21-aug-2012. office of foreign assets control (ofac) notes: eye color brown; hair color brown; individual's primary language pashto; operational commander of the haqqani network eu notes: additional information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the sanctions committee: badruddin haqqani is the operational commander for the haqqani network, a taliban-affiliated group of militants that operates from north waziristan agency in the federally administered tribal areas of pakistan. the haqqani network has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in afghanistan, responsible for many high-profile attacks. the haqqani network's leadership consists of the three eldest sons of its founder jalaluddin haqqani, who joined mullah mohammed omar's taliban regime in the mid-1990s. badruddin is the son of jalaluddin and brother to nasiruddin haqqani and sirajuddin haqqani, as well as nephew of khalil ahmed haqqani. badruddin helps lead taliban associated insurgents and foreign fighters in attacks against targets in south- eastern afghanistan. badruddin sits on the miram shah shura of the taliban, which has authority over haqqani network activities. badruddin is also believed to be in charge of kidnappings for the haqqani network. he has been responsible for the kidnapping of numerous afghans and foreign nationals in the afghanistan-pakistan border region. un notes: other information: operational commander of the haqqani network and member of the taliban shura in miram shah. has helped lead attacks against targets in southeastern afghanistan. son of jalaluddin haqqani (ti.h.40.01.). brother of sirajuddin jallaloudine haqqani (ti.h.144.07.) and nasiruddin haqqani (ti.h.146.10.). nephew of khalil ahmed haqqani (ti.h.150.11.). reportedly deceased in late august 2012. federal financial monitoring services notes: entities and individuals against whom there is evidence of involvement in terrorism. dow jones spokesperson sophie bent said: “this dataset is part of our risk and compliance feed product, which is entirely derived from publicly available sources.” the spokepserson said an “authorized third party” was to blame for the exposure, but did not name the alleged company or provide evidence for the claim. we asked dow jones specific questions, such as who the source of the data leak was and if the exposure would be reported to u.s. regulators and european data protection authorities, but the company would not comment on the record. two years ago, dow jones admitted a similar cloud storage misconfiguration exposed the names and contact information of 2.2 million customers, including subscribers of the wall street journal. the company described the event as an “error.” got a tip? you can send tips securely over signal and whatsapp to +1 646-755–8849. you can also send pgp email with the fingerprint: 4d0e 92f2 e36a ec51 daae 5d97 cb8c 15fa eb6c eea5. massive mortgage and loan data leak gets worse as original documents also exposed"
"china’s new tech force pinduoduo is continuing its race to upend the e-commerce space, even at the expense of its finances. the three-year-old startup earmarked some big wins from the 2018 fiscal year, but losses were even greater, dragging its shares down 17 percent on wednesday after the firm released its latest earnings results. the shanghai-based company is famous for offering cheap group deals; it’s able to keep prices down by sourcing directly from manufacturers and farmers, cutting out middleman costs. in 2018, the company saw its gross merchandise value, referring to total sales regardless of whether the items were actually sold, delivered or returned, jump 234 percent to 471.6 billion yuan ($68.6 billion). fourth-quarter annual active buyers increased 71 percent to 418.5 million, during which monthly active users nearly doubled, to 272.6 million. these figures should have industry pioneers alibaba and jd sweating. in the 12 months ended december 31, jd fell behind pinduoduo with a smaller aau base of 305 million. alibaba still held a lead over its peers with 636 million aaus, though its year-over-year growth was a milder 23 percent. but pinduoduo also saw heavy financial strain in the past year as it drifted away from becoming profitable. operating loss soared to 10.8 billion yuan ($1.57 billion), compared to just under 600 million yuan in the year-earlier period. fourth-quarter operating loss widened a staggering 116 times to 2.64 billion yuan ($384 million), up from 22 million yuan a year ago. chinese e-commerce challenger pinduoduo is raising over $1 billion more pinduoduo is presenting a stark contrast to consistently profitable alibaba, which generates the bulk of its income from charging advertising fees on its marketplaces. this light-asset approach grants alibaba wider profit margins than its arch-foe jd, which controls most of the supply chain like amazon and makes money from direct sales. pinduoduo seeks out a path similar to alibaba’s and monetizes through marketing services, but its latest financial results showed that mounting costs have tempered a supposedly lucrative model. where did the e-commerce challenger spend its money? pinduoduo’s total operating expenses from 2018 stood at 21 billion yuan ($3 billion), of which 13.4 billion yuan went to sales and marketing expenses such as tv commercials and discounts for users. administration alongside research and development made up the remaining costs. pinduoduo’s spending spree recalls the path of another up-and-coming chinese tech startup, qutoutiao . like pinduoduo, qutoutiao has embarked on a cash-intensive journey by burning billions of dollars to acquire users. the scheme worked, and qutoutiao, which runs a popular news app and a growing e-book service, is effectively challenging bytedance (tiktok’s parent company) in smaller chinese cities, where many veteran tech giants lack dominance. offering ultra-cheap items is a smart bet for pinduoduo to lock in price-intensive consumers in unpenetrated, smaller cities, but it’s way too soon to know whether this kind of expensive growth will hold out long-term. china’s qutoutiao is burning millions of dollars to take on tiktok parent"
"mark zuckerberg says it might be right for facebook to let people pay to not see ads, but that it would feel wrong to charge users for extra privacy controls. that’s just one of the fascinating philosophical views the ceo shared during the first of his public talks he’s promised as part of his 2019 personal challenge. talking to harvard law and computer science professor jonathan zittrain on the campus of the university he dropped out of, zuckerberg managed to escape the 100-minute conversation with just a few gaffes. at one point he said “we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations”. zittrain swiftly reminded him that’s exactly what facebook portal is, and zuckerberg tried to deflect by saying portal’s recordings would be encrypted. later zuckerberg mentioned “the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see” which is pretty sad and derisive assessment of the personal photos and status updates people share. and when he suggested crowdsourced fact-checking, zittrain chimed in that this could become an avenue for “astroturfing” where mobs of users provide purposefully biased information to promote their interests, like a political group’s supporting voting that their opponents’ facts are lies. while sometimes avoiding hard stances on questions, zuckerberg was otherwise relatively logical and coherent. policy and cooperating with governments the ceo touched on his borderline content policy that quietly demotes posts that come close to breaking its policy against nudity, hate speech etc that otherwise are the most sensational and get the most distribution but don’t make people feel good. zuckerberg noted some progress here, saying “a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that.” this aligns with zuckerberg contemplating facebook’s role as a “data fiduciary” where rather than necessarily giving in to users’ urges or prioritizing its short-term share price, the company tries to do what’s in the best long-term interest of its communities. “there’s a hard balance here which is — i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want” he said. essentially, people might tap on clickbait even if it doesn’t make them feel good. on working with governments, zuckerberg explained how incentives weren’t always aligned, like when law enforcement is monitoring someone accidentally dropping clues about their crimes and collaborators. the government and society might benefit from that continued surveillance but facebook might want to immediately suspend the account if it found out. “but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, ‘hey, this is where we’re at'”, implying facebook might purposefully allow that person to keep incriminating themselves to assist the authorities. but disagreements between governments can flare up, zuckerberg notes that “we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted.” that’s likely a reference to the 2016 arrest of facebook’s vp for latin amercia diego dzodan over whatsapp’s encryption preventing the company from providing evidence for a drug case. decentralizing facebook the tradeoffs of encryption and decentralization were a central theme. he discussed how while many people fear how encryption could mask illegal or offensive activity, facebook doesn’t have to peek at someone’s actual content to determine they’re violating policy. “one of the — i guess, somewhat surprising to me — findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content” zuckerberg said. with facebook rapidly building out a blockchain team to potentially launch a cryptocurrency for fee-less payments or an identity layer for decentralized applications, zittrain asked about the potential for letting users control which other apps they give their profile information to without facebook as an intermediary. san jose, ca – may 01: facebook ceo mark zuckerberg (photo by justin sullivan/getty images) zuckerberg stressed that at facebook’s scale, moving to a less efficient distributed architecture would be extremely “computationally intense” though it might eventually be possible. instead, he said “one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed.” this might be attractive to developers who would know facebook couldn’t cut them off from the users. the problem is that if a developer was abusing users, zuckerberg fears that “in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution?” no “pay for privacy” but perhaps most novel and urgent were zuckerberg’s comments on the secondary questions raised by where facebook should let people pay to remove ads. “you start getting into a principle question which is ‘are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people?’ and my answer to that is a hard no.” facebook has promised to always operate free version so everyone can have a voice. yet some including myself have suggested that a premium ad-free subscription to facebook could help ween it off maximizing data collection and engagement, though it might break facebook’s revenue machine by pulling the most affluent and desired users out of the ad targeting pool. “what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle” zuckerberg expands. “it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong.” back in may, zuckerberg announced facebook would build a clear history button in 2018 that deletes all the web browsing data the social network has collected about you, but that data’s deep integration into the company’s systems has delayed the launch. research suggests users don’t want the inconvenience of getting logged out of all their facebook connected services, though, they’d like to hide certain data from the company. “clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay.” of all the apologies, promises, and predictions zuckerberg has made recently, this pledge might instill the most confidence. while some might think of zuckerberg as a data tyrant out to absorb and exploit as much of our personal info as possible, there are at least lines he’s not willing to cross. facebook could try to charge you for privacy, but it won’t. and given facebook’s dominance in social networking and messaging plus zuckerberg’s voting control of the company, a greedier man could make the internet much worse. — transcript – mark zuckerberg at harvard / first personal challenge 2019 jonathan zittrain: very good. so, thank you, mark, for coming to talk to me and to our students from the techtopia program and from my “internet and society” course at harvard law school. we’re really pleased to have a chance to talk about any number of issues and we should just dive right in. so, privacy, autonomy, and information fiduciaries. mark zuckerberg: all right! jonathan zittrain: love to talk about that. mark zuckerberg: yeah! i read your piece in the new york times. jonathan zittrain: the one with the headline that said, “mark zuckerberg can fix this mess”? mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: although that was last year. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: that’s true! are you suggesting it’s all fixed? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no. no. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: okay, good. so– jonathan zittrain: i’m suggesting that i’m curious whether you still think that we can fix this mess? jonathan zittrain: ah! <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i hope– <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “hope springs eternal”– mark zuckerberg: yeah, there you go. jonathan zittrain: –is my motto. so, all right, let me give a quick characterization of this idea that the coinage and the scaffolding for it is from my colleague, jack balkin, at yale. and the two of us have been developing it out further. there are a standard number of privacy questions with which you might have some familiarity, having to do with people conveying information that they know they’re conveying or they’re not so sure they are, but “mouse droppings” as we used to call them when they run in the rafters of the internet and leave traces. and then the standard way of talking about that is you want to make sure that that stuff doesn’t go where you don’t want it to go. and we call that “informational privacy”. we don’t want people to know stuff that we want maybe our friends only to know. and on a place like facebook, you’re supposed to be able to tweak your settings and say, “give them to this and not to that.” but there’s also ways in which stuff that we share with consent could still sort of be used against us and it feels like, “well, you consented,” may not end the discussion. and the analogy that my colleague jack brought to bear was one of a doctor and a patient or a lawyer and a client or– sometimes in america, but not always– a financial advisor and a client that says that those professionals have certain expertise, they get trusted with all sorts of sensitive information from their clients and patients and, so, they have an extra duty to act in the interests of those clients even if their own interests conflict. and, so, maybe just one quick hypo to get us started. i wrote a piece in 2014, that maybe you read, that was a hypothetical about elections in which it said, “just hypothetically, imagine that facebook had a view about which candidate should win and they reminded people likely to vote for the favored candidate that it was election day,” and to others they simply sent a cat photo. would that be wrong? and i find– i have no idea if it’s illegal; it does seem wrong to me and it might be that the fiduciary approach captures what makes it wrong. mark zuckerberg: all right. so, i think we could probably spend the whole next hour just talking about that! <laughter> mark zuckerberg: so, i read your op-ed and i also read balkin’s blogpost on information fiduciaries. and i’ve had a conversation with him, too. jonathan zittrain: great. mark zuckerberg: and the– at first blush, kind of reading through this, my reaction is there’s a lot here that makes sense. right? the idea of us having a fiduciary relationship with the people who use our services is kind of intuitively– it’s how we think about how we’re building what we’re building. so, reading through this, it’s like, all right, you know, a lot of people seem to have this mistaken notion that when we’re putting together news feed and doing ranking that we have a team of people who are focused on maximizing the time that people spend, but that’s not the goal that we give them. we tell people on the team, “produce the service–” that we think is going to be the highest quality that– we try to ground it in kind of getting people to come in and tell us, right, of the content that we could potentially show what is going to be– they tell us what they want to see, then we build models that kind of– that can predict that, and build that service. jonathan zittrain: and, by the way, was that always the case or– mark zuckerberg: no. jonathan zittrain: –was that a place you got to through some course adjustments? mark zuckerberg: through course adjustments. i mean, you start off using simpler signals like what people are clicking on in feed, but then you pretty quickly learn, “hey, that gets you to local optimum,” right? where if you’re focusing on what people click on and predicting what people click on, then you select for click bait. right? so, pretty quickly you realize from real feedback, from real people, that’s not actually what people want. you’re not going to build the best service by doing that. so, you bring in people and actually have these panels of– we call it “getting to ground truth”– of you show people all the candidates for what can be shown to them and you have people say, “what’s the most meaningful thing that i wish that this system were showing us? so, all this is kind of a way of saying that our own self image of ourselves and what we’re doing is that we’re acting as fiduciaries and trying to build the best services for people. where i think that this ends up getting interesting is then the question of who gets to decide in the legal sense or the policy sense of what’s in people’s best interest? right? so, we come in every day and think, “hey, we’re building a service where we’re ranking newsfeed trying to show people the most relevant content with an assumption that’s backed by data; that, in general, people want us to show them the most relevant content. but, at some level, you could ask the question which is “who gets to decide that ranking newsfeed or showing relevant ads?” or any of the other things that we choose to work on are actually in people’s interest. and we’re doing the best that we can to try to build the services [ph?] that we think are the best. at the end of the day, a lot of this is grounded in “people choose to use it.” right? because, clearly, they’re getting some value from it. but then there are all these questions like you say about, you have– about where people can effectively give consent and not. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: so, i think that there’s a lot of interesting questions in this to unpack about how you’d implement a model like that. but, at a high level i think, you know, one of the things that i think about in terms of we’re running this big company; it’s important in society that people trust the institutions of society. clearly, i think we’re in a position now where people rightly have a lot of questions about big internet companies, facebook in particular, and i do think getting to a point there there’s the right regulation and rules in place just provides a kind of societal guardrail framework where people can have confidence that, okay, these companies are operating within a framework that we’ve all agreed. that’s better than them just doing whatever they want. and i think that that would give people confidence. so, figuring out what that framework is, i think, is a really important thing. and i’m sure we’ll talk about that as it relates– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –to a lot of the content areas today. but getting to that question of how do you– “who determines what’s in people’s best interest, if not people themselves?”jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –is a really interesting question. jonathan zittrain: yes, so, we should surely talk about that. so, on our agenda is the “who decides?” question. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: other agenda items include– just as you say, the fiduciary framework sounds nice to you– doctors, patients, facebook users. and i hear you saying that’s pretty much where you’re wanting to end up anyway. there are some interesting questions about what people want, versus what they want to want. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: people will say “on january 1st, what i want–” new year’s resolution– “is a gym membership.” and then on january 2nd, they don’t want to go to the gym. they want to want to go to the gym, but they never quite make it. and then, of course, a business model of pay for the whole year ahead of time and they know you’ll never turn up develops around that. and i guess a specific area to delve into for a moment on that might be on the advertising side of things, maybe the dichotomy between personalization and does it ever going into exploitation? now, there might be stuff– i know facebook, for example, bans payday loans as best it can. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that’s just a substantive area that it’s like, “all right, we don’t want to do that.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: but when we think about good personalization so that facebook knows i have a dog and not a cat, and a targeter can then offer me dog food and not cat food. how about, if not now, a future day in which an advertising platform can offer to an ad targeter some sense of “i just lost my pet, i’m really upset, i’m ready to make some snap decisions that i might regret later, but when i make them–“ mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: “–i’m going to make them.” so, this is the perfect time to tee up mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –a cubic zirconia or whatever the thing is that– . mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that seems to me a fiduciary approach would say, ideally– how we get there i don’t know, but ideally we wouldn’t permit that kind of approach to somebody using the information we’ve gleaned from them to know they’re in a tough spot– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and then to exploit them. but i don’t know. i don’t know how you would think about something like that. could you write an algorithm to detect something like that? mark zuckerberg: well, i think one of the key principles is that we’re trying to run this company for the long term. and i think that people think that a lot of things that– if you were just trying to optimize the profits for next quarter or something like that, you might want to do things that people might like in the near term, but over the long term will come to resent. but if you actually care about building a community and achieving this mission and building the company for the long term, i think you’re just much more aligned than people often think companies are. and it gets back to the idea before, where i think our self image is largely acting as– in this kind of fiduciary relationship as you’re saying– and across– we could probably go through a lot of different examples. i mean, we don’t want to show people content that they’re going to click on and engage with, but then feel like they wasted their time afterwards. where we don’t want to show them things that they’re going to make a decision based off of that and then regret later. i mean, there’s a hard balance here which is– i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want. so, i think there’s a question between when something is exploitative versus when something is real, but isn’t what you would say that you want. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s a really hard thing to get at. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but on a lot of these cases my experience of running the company is that you start off building a system, you have relatively unsophisticated signals to start, and you build up increasingly complex models over time that try to take into account more of what people care about. and there are all these examples that we can go through. i think probably newsfeed and ads are probably the two most complex ranking examples– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –that we have. but it’s– like we were talking about a second ago, when we started off with the systems, i mean, just start with newsfeeds– but you could do this on ads, too– you know, the most naïve signals, right, are what people click on or what people “like”. but then you just very quickly realize that that doesn’t– it approximates something, but it’s a very crude approximation of the ground truth of what people actually care about. so, what you really want to get to is as much as possible getting real people to look at the real candidates for content and tell you in a multi-dimensional way what matters to them and try to build systems that model that. and then you want to be kind of conservative on preventing downside. so, your example of the payday loans– and when we’ve talked about this in the past, your– you’ve put the question to me of “how do you know when a payday loan is going to be exploitative?” right? “if you’re targeting someone who is in a bad situation?” and our answer is, “well, we don’t really know when it’s going to be exploitative, but we think that the whole category potentially has a massive risk of that, so we just ban it– jonathan zittrain: right. which makes it an easy case. mark zuckerberg: yes. and i think that the harder cases are when there’s significant upside and significant downside and you want to weigh both of them. so, i mean, for example, once we started putting together a really big effort on preventing election interference, one of the initial ideas that came up was “why don’t we just ban all ads that relate to anything that is political?” and they you pretty quickly get into, all right, well, what’s a political ad? the classic legal definition is things that are around elections and candidates, but that’s not actually what russia and other folks were primarily doing. right? it’s– you know, a lot of the issues that we’ve seen are around issue ads, right, and basically sewing division on what are social issues. so, all right, i don’t think you’re going to get in the way of people’s speech and ability to promote and do advocacy on issues that they care about. so, then the question is “all right, well, so, then what’s the right balance?” of how do you make sure that you’re providing the right level of controls, that people who aren’t supposed to be participating in these debates aren’t or that at least you’re providing the right transparency. but i think we’ve veered a little bit from the original questionjonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –but the– but, yeah. so, let’s get back to where you were jonathan zittrain: well, here’s– and this is a way of maybe moving it forward, which is: a platform as complete as facebook is these days offers lots of opportunities to shape what people see and possibly to help them with those nudges, that it’s time to go to the gym or to avoid them from falling into the depredations of the payday loan. and it is a question of so long as the platform to do it, does it now have an ethical obligation to do it, to help people achieve the good life? mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and i worry that it is too great a burden for any company to bear to have to figure out, say, if not the perfect, the most reasonable newsfeed for every one of the– how many? two and a half billion active users? something like that. mark zuckerberg: yeah. on that order. jonathan zittrain: all the time and there might be some ways that start a little bit to get into the engineering of the thing that would say, “okay, with all hindsight, are there ways to architect this so that the stakes aren’t as high, aren’t as focused on just, “gosh, is facebook doing this right?” it’s as if there was only one newspaper in the whole world or one or two, and it’s like, “well, then what the new york times chooses to put on it’s home page, if it were the only newspaper, would have outsize importance.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: so, just as a technical matter, a number of the students in this room had a chance to hear from tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, and he has a new idea for something called “solid”. i don’t know if you’ve heard of solid. it’s a protocol more than it is a product. so, there’s no car to move off the lot today. but its idea is allowing people to have the data that they generate as they motor around the web end up in their own kind of data locker. now, for somebody like tim, it might mean literally in a locker under his desk and he could wake up in the middle of the night and see where his data is. for others, it might mean iraq somewhere, guarded perhaps by a fiduciary who’s looking out for them, the way that we put money in a bank and then we can sleep at night knowing the bankers are– this is maybe not the best analogy in 2019, but watching. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’ll get there. jonathan zittrain: we’ll get there. but solid says if you did that, people would then– or their helpful proxies– be able to say, “all right, facebook is coming along. it wants the following data from me and including that data that it has generated about me as i use it, but stored back in my locker and it kind of has to come back to my well to draw water each time. and that way if i want to switch to schmacebook or something, it’s still in my well and i can just immediately grant permission to schmacebook to see it and i don’t have to do a kind of data slurp and then re-upload it. it’s a fully distributed way of thinking about data. and i’m curious from an engineering perspective does this seem doable with something of the size and the number of spinning wheels that facebook has and does it seem like a mark zuckerberg: yeah– jonathan zittrain: –and i’m curious your reaction to an idea like that. mark zuckerberg: so, i think it’s quite interesting. certainly, the level of computation that facebook is doing and all the services that we’re building is really intense to do in a distributed way. i mean, i think as a basic model i think we’re building out the data center capacity over the next five years and our plan for what we think we need to do that we think is on the order of all of what aws and google cloud are doing for supporting all of their customers. so, okay, so, this is like a relatively computationally intense thing. over time you assume you’ll get more compute. so, decentralized things which are less efficient computationally will be harder– sorry, they’re harder to do computation on, but eventually maybe you have the compute resources to do that. i think the more interesting questions there are not feasibility in the near term, but are the philosophical questions of the goodness of a system like that. so, one question if you want to– so, we can get into decentralization, one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed. jonathan zittrain: “do you want to login with your facebook account?” is the status quo mark zuckerberg: basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice of whether to login to different places and you’re not going through an intermediary, which is kind of like what you’re suggesting here– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –in a sense. okay, now, there’s a lot of things that i think would be quite attractive about that. you know, for developers one of the things that is really troubling about working with our system, or google’s system for that matter, or having your services through apple’s app store, is that you don’t want to have an intermediary between serving your– the people who are using your service and you, right, where someone can just say, “hey, we as a developer have to follow your policy and if we don’t, then you can cut off access to the people we’re serving.” that’s kind of a difficult and troubling position to be in. i think developers– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: –you’re referring to a recent incident. mark zuckerberg: no, well, i was– well, sure<laughter> mark zuckerberg: but i think it underscores the– i think every developer probably feels this: people are using any app store but also login with facebook, with google; any of these services, you want a direct relationship with the people you serve. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: now, okay, but let’s look at the flip side. so, what we saw in the last couple of years with cambridge analytica, was basically an example where people chose to take data that they– some of it was their data, some of it was data that they had seen from their friends, right? because if you want to do things like making it so alternative services can build a competing newsfeed, then you need to be able to make it so that people can bring the data that they see you [ph?] within the system. okay, theybasically, people chose to give their data to a developer who’s affiliated with cambridge university, which is a really respected institution, and then that developer turned around and sold the data to the firm cambridge analytica, which is in violation of our policies. so, we cut off the developers’ access. and, of course, in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution? in some ways it’s a lot easier to regulate and hold accountable large companies like facebook or google, because they’re more visible, they’re more transparent than the long tail of services that people would chose to then go interact with directly. so, i think that this is a really interesting social question. to some degree i think this idea of going in the direction of blockchain authentication is less gated on the technology and capacity to do that. i think if you were doing fully decentralized facebook, that would take massive computation, but i’m sure we could do fully decentralized authentication if we wanted to. i think the real question is do you really want that? jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: right? and i think you’d have more cases where, yes, people would be able to not have an intermediary, but you’d also have more cases of abuse and the recourse would be much harder. jonathan zittrain: yes. what i hear you saying is people as they go about their business online are generating data about themselves that’s quite valuable, if not to themselves, to others who might interact with them. and the more they are empowered, possibly through a distributed system, to decide where that data goes, with whom they want to share it, the more they could be exposed to exploitation. this is a genuine dilemma– mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –because i’m a huge fan of decentralization. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: but i also see the problem. and maybe one answer is there’s some data that’s just so toxic there’s no vessel we should put it in; it might eat a whole through it or something, metaphorically speaking. but, then again, innocuous data can so quickly be assembled into something scary. so, i don’t know if the next election– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: yeah. [ph?] i mean, i think in general we’re talking about the large-scale of data being assembled into meaning something different from what the individual data points mean. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that’s the whole challenge here. but i philosophically agree with you thati mean, i want to think about the– like, i do think about the work that we’re doing as a decentralizing force in the world, right? a lot of the reason why i think people of my generation got into technology is because we believe that technology gives individuals power and isn’t massively centralizing. now you’ve built a bunch of big companies in the process, but i think what has largely happened is that individuals today have more voice, more ability to affiliate with who they want, and stay connected with people, ability to form communities in ways that they couldn’t before, and i think that’s massively empowering to individuals and that’s philosophically kind of the side that i tend to be on. so, that’s why i’m thinking about going back to decentralized or blockchain authentication. that’s why i’m kind of bouncing around how could you potentially make this work, because from my orientation is to try to go in that direction. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: an example where i think we’re generally a lot closer to going in that direction is encryption. i mean, this is, like, one of the really big debates today is basically what are the boundaries on where you would want a messaging service to be encrypted. and there are all these benefits from a privacy and security perspective, but, on the other hand, if what we’re trying to do– one of the big issues that we’re grappling with content governance and where is the line between free expression and, i suppose, privacy on one side, but safety on the other as people do really bad things, right, some of the time. and i think people rightfully have an expectation of us that we’re going to do everything we can to stop terrorists from recruiting people or people from exploiting children or doing different things. and moving in the direction of making these systems more encrypted certainly reduces some of the signals that we would have access to be able to do some of that really important work. but here we are, right, we’re sitting in this position where we’re running whatsapp, which is the largest end-to-end encrypting service in the world; we’re running messenger, which is another one of the largest messaging systems in the world where encryption is an option, but it isn’t the default. i don’t think long term it really makes sense to be running different systems with very different policies on this. i think this is sort of a philosophical question where you want to figure out where you want to be on it. and, so, my question for you– now, i’ll talk about how i’m thinking about this– is all right, if you were in my position and you got to flip a switch is probably too glib, because there’s a lot of work that goes into this, and go in one direction for both of those services, who would you think about that? jonathan zittrain: well, the question you’re putting on the table, which is a hard one is “is it okay,” and let’s just take the simple case, “for two people to communicate with each other in a way that makes it difficult for any third party to casually listen in?” is that okay? and i think that the way we normally answer that question is kind of a form of what you might call status quo-ism, which is not satisfying. it’s whatever has been the case is— mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –whatever has been the case is what should stay the case. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and, so, for whatsapp, it’s like right now whatsapp, as i understand it, you could correct me if i’m wrong, is pretty hard to get into if– mark zuckerberg: it’s fully end-to-end encrypted. jonathan zittrain: right. so, if facebook gets handed a subpoena or a warrant or something from name-your-favorite-country– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and you’re just like, “thank you for playing. we have nothing to–” <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted. jonathan zittrain: yes. and then, on the other hand, and this is not as clean as it could be in theory, but messenger is sometimes encrypted, sometimes not. if it doesn’t happen to have been encrypted by the users, then that subpoena could work and, more than that, there could start to be some automated systems either on facebook’s own initiative or under pressure from governments in the general case, not a specific warrant, to say, “hey, if the following phrases appear, if there’s some telltale that says, “this is somebody going after a kid for exploitation,” it should be forwarded up. if that’s already happening and we can produce x-number of people who have been identified and a number of crimes averted that way, who wants to be the person to be like, “lock it down!” like, “we don’t want any more of that!” but i guess, to put myself now to your question, when i look out over years rather than just weeks or months, the ability to casually peek at any conversation going on between two people or among a small group of people or even to have a machine do it for you, so, you can just set your alert list, you know, crudely speaking, and get stuff back, that– it’s always trite to call something orwellian, but it makes orwell look like a piker. i mean, it seems like a classic case where you– the next sentence would be “what could possible go wrong?” jonathan zittrain: and we can fill that in! and it does mean, though, i think that we have to confront the fact that if we choose to allow that kind of communication, then there’s going to be crimes unsolved that could’ve been solved. there’s going to be crimes not prevented that could have been prevented. and the only thing that kind of blunts it a little is it is not really all or nothing. the modern surveillance states of note in the world, have a lot of arrows in their quivers. and just being able to darken you door and demand surveillance of a certain kind, that might be a first thing they would go to, but they’ve got a plan b, and plan c, and a plan d. and i guess it really gets to what’s your threat model? if you think everybody is kind of a threat, think about the battles of copyright 15 years ago. everybody is a potential infringer. all they have to do is fire up napster, then you’re wanting some massive technical infrastructure to prevent the bad thing. if what you’re thinking is instead, they are a few really bad apples and they tend to– when they congregate online or otherwise with one another– tend to identify themselves and then we might have to send somebody near their house to listen with a cup at the window, metaphorically speaking. that’s a different threat model and [sic] might not need it. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: is that getting to an answer to your question? mark zuckerberg: yeah, and i think i generally agree. i mean, i’ve already said publically that my inclination is to move these services in the direction of being all encrypted, at least the private communication version. i basically think if you want to kind of talk in metaphors, messaging is like people’s living room, right? and i think we– you know, we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations. jonathan zittrain: even as we’re now– i mean, it is 2019, people are happily are putting cameras in their living rooms. mark zuckerberg: that’s their choice, but i guess they’re putting cameras in their living rooms, well, for a number of reasons, but– jonathan zittrain: and facebook has a camera that you can go into your living room- <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that is, i guess– jonathan zittrain: i just want to be clear. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: yeah, although that would be encrypted in this world. jonathan zittrain: encrypted between you and facebook! mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. i think– but it also– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: doesn’t it have like a little alexa functionality, too? mark zuckerberg: well, portal works over messenger. so, if we go towards encryption on messenger, then that’ll be fully encrypted, which i think, frankly, is probably what people want. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: the other model, beside the living room is the town square and that, i think, just has different social norms and different policies and norms that should be at play around that. but i do think that these things are very different. right? you’re not going to– you may end up in a world where the town square is a fully decentralized or fully encrypted thing, but it’s not clear what value there is in encrypting something that’s public content anyway, or very broad. jonathan zittrain: but, now, you were put to it pretty hard in that as i understand it there’s now a change to how whatsapp works, that there’s only five forwards permitted. mark zuckerberg: yeah, so, this is a really interesting point, right? so, when people talk about how encryption will darken some of the signals that we’ll be able to use, you know, both for potentially providing better services and for preventing harm. one of the– i guess, somewhat surprising to me, findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content. jonathan zittrain: so-called meta data. mark zuckerberg: sure. jonathan zittrain: “i don’t know what they’re saying, but here’s who’s they’re calling” kind of thing. mark zuckerberg: yeah, or just like they– this account doesn’t seem to really act like a person, right? and i guess as ai gets more advanced and you build these adversarial networks or generalized adversarial networks, you’ll get to a place where you have ai that can probably more effectively jonathan zittrain: go under mimic [ph?] cover. mimic act like another person– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: –for a while. mark zuckerberg: yeah. but, at the same time, you’ll be building up contrary ai on the other side, but is better at identifying ais that are doing that. but this has certainly been the most effective tactic across a lot of the areas where we’ve needed to focus to preventing harm. you know, the ability to identify fake accounts, which, like, a huge amount of the– under any category of issue that you’re talking about, a lot of the issues downstream come from fake accounts or people who are clearly acting in some malicious or not normal way. you can identify a lot of that without necessarily even looking at the content itself. and if you have to look at a piece of content, then in some cases, you’re already late, because the content exists and the activity has already happened. so, that’s one of the things that makes me feel like encryption for these messaging services is really the right direction to go, because you’re– it’s a very proprivacy and per security move to give people that control and assurance and i’m relatively confident that even though you are losing some tools to– on the finding harmful content side of the ledger, i don’t think at the end of the day that those are going to end up being the most important tools jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –for finding the most of the– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: but now connect it up quickly to the five forwards thing. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, sure. so, that gets down to if you’re not operating on a piece of content directly, you need to operate on patterns of behavior in the network. and what we, basically found was there weren’t that many good uses for people forwarding things more than five times except to basically spam or blast stuff off. it was being disproportionately abused. so, you end up thinking about different tactics when you’re not operating on content specifically; you end up thinking about patterns of usage more. jonathan zittrain: well, spam, i get and that– i’m always in favor of things that reduce spam. however, you could also say the second category was just to spread content. you could have the classic, i don’t know, like les mis, or paul revere’s ride, or arab spring-esque in the romanticized vision of it: “gosh, this is a way for people to do a tree,” and pass along a message that “you can’t stop the signal,” to use a joss whedon reference. you really want to get the word out. this would obviously stop that, too. mark zuckerberg: yeah, and then i think the question is you’re just weighing whether you want this private communication tool where the vast majority of the use and the reason why it was designed was the vast majority of just one-on-one; there’s a large amount of groups that people communicate into, but it’s a pretty small edge case of people operating this with, like– you have a lot of different groups and you’re trying to organize something and almost hack public content-type or public sharing- type utility into an encrypted space and, again, there i think you start getting into “is this the living room or is this the town square?” and when people start trying to use tools that are designed for one thing to get around what i think the social norms are for the town square, that’s when i think you probably start to have some issues. this is not– we’re not done addressing these issues. there’s a lot more to think through on this jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: –but that’s the general shape of the problem that at least i perceive from the work that we’re doing. jonathan zittrain: well, without any particular segue, let’s talk about fake news. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, insert your favorite segue here. there’s some choice or at least some decision that gets made to figure out what’s going to be next in my newsfeed when i scroll up a little more. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and in the last conversation bit, we were talking about how much we’re looking at content versus telltales and metadata, things that surround the content. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for knowing about what that next thing in the newsfeed should be, is it a valid desirable material consideration, do you think, for a platform like facebook to say is the thing we are about to present true, whatever true means? mark zuckerberg: well, yes, because, again, getting at trying to serve people, people tell us that they don’t want fake content. right. i mean, i don’t know anyone who wants fake content. i think the whole issue is, again, who gets to decide. right. so broadly speaking, i don’t know any individual who would sit there and say, “yes, please show me things that you know are false and that are fake.” people want good quality content and information. that said, i don’t really think that people want us to be deciding what is true for them and people disagree on what is true. and, like, truth is, i mean, there are different levels of when someone is telling a story, maybe the meta arc is talking about something that is true but the facts that were used in it are wrong in some nuanced way but, like, it speaks to some deeper experience. well, was that true or not? and do people want that disqualified from to them? i think different people are going to come to different places on this. now, so i’ve been very sensitive, which, on, like, we really want to make sure that we’re showing people high quality content and information. we know that people don’t want false information. so we’re building quite advanced systems to be able to– to make sure that we’re emphasizing and showing stuff that is going to be high quality. but the big question is where do you get the signal on what the quality is? so the kind of initial v.1 of this was working with third party fact checkers. right, i believe very strongly that people do not want facebook and that we should not be the arbiters of truth in deciding what is correct for everyone in the society. i think people already generally think that we have too much power in deciding what content is good. i tend to also be concerned about that and we should talk about some of the governance stuff that we’re working on separately to try to make it so that we can bring more independent oversight into that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but let’s put that in a box for now and just say that with those concerns in mind, i’m definitely not looking to try to take on a lot more in terms of also deciding in addition to enforcing all the content policies, also deciding what is true for everyone in the world. okay, so v.1 of that is we’re going to work with– jonathan zittrain: truth experts. mark zuckerberg: we’re working with fact checkers. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: and, and they’re experts and basically, there’s like a whole field of how you go and assess certain content. they’re accredited. people can disagree with the leaning of some of these organizations. jonathan zittrain: <laughter> who does accredited fact checkers? mark zuckerberg: <laughs> the poynter institute for journalism. jonathan zittrain: i should apply for my certification. mark zuckerberg: you may. jonathan zittrain: okay, good. mark zuckerberg: you’d probably get it, but you have to– you’d have to go through the process. mark zuckerberg: the issue there is there aren’t enough of them, right. so there’s a large content. there’s obviously a lot of information is shared every day and there just aren’t a lot of fact checkers. so then the question is okay, that is probably jonathan zittrain: but the portion– you’re saying the food is good, it’s just the portions are small. but the food is good. mark zuckerberg: i think in general, but so you build systems, which is what we’ve done especially leading up to elections where i think are some of the most fraught times around this where people really are aggressively trying to spread misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: you build systems that prioritize content that seems like it’s going viral because you want to reduce the prevalence of how widespread the stuff gets, so that way the fact checkers have tools to be able to, like, prioritize what they need to go– what they need to go look at. but it’s still getting to a relatively small percent of the content. so i think the real thing that we want to try to get to over time is more of a crowd sourced model where people, it’s not that people are trusting some sort, some basic set of experts who are accredited but are in some kid of lofty institution somewhere else. it’s like do you trust, yeah, like, if you get enough data points from within the community of people reasonably looking at something and assessing it over time, then the question is can you compound that together into something that is a strong enough signal that we can then use that? jonathan zittrain: kind of in the old school like a slash-dot moderating system mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: with only the worry that if the stakes get high enough, somebody wants to astroturf that. mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: i’d be– mark zuckerberg: there are a lot of questions here, which is why i’m not sitting here and announcing a new program. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: but what i’m saying is this is, like,– jonathan zittrain: yeah, mark zuckerberg: this is the general direction that i think we should be thinking about when we haveand i think that there’s a lot of questions and– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and we’d like to run some tests in this area to see whether this can help out. which would be upholding the principles which are that we want to stop– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: the spread of misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: knowing that no one wants misinformation. and the other principle, which is that we do not want to be arbiters of truth. jonathan zittrain: want to be the decider, yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that that’s the basic– those are the basic contours i think of that, of that problem. jonathan zittrain: so let me run an idea by you that you can process in real time and tell me the eight reasons i have not thought of why this is a terrible idea. and that would be people see something in their facebook feed. they’re about to share it out because it’s got a kind of outrage factor to it. i think of the classic story from two years ago in the denver guardian about “fbi agent suspected in hilary clinton email leak implicated in murder-suicide.” i have just uttered fake news. none of that was true if you clicked through the denver guardian. there was just that article. there is denver guardian. if you live in denver, you cannot subscribe. like, it is unambiguously fake. and it was shared more times than the most shared story during the election season of the boston globe. and so mark zuckerberg: so, and this is actually an example, by the way, of where trying to figure out fake accounts is a much simpler solution. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: than trying to down– jonathan zittrain: so if newspaper has one article– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: wait for ten more before you decide they’re a newspaper. mark zuckerberg: yeah. or, you know, i mean, it’s there are any number of systems that you could build to basically detect, “hey, this is–” jonathan zittrain: a potemkin. mark zuckerberg: this is a fraudulent thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and then you can take that down. and again, that ends up being a much less controversial decision because you’re doing it upstream based on the basis of inauthenticity. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: in a system where people are supposed to be their real and represent that they’re their real selves than downstream, trying to say, “hey, is this true or false?” jonathan zittrain: i made a mistake in giving you the easy case. mark zuckerberg: okay. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so i should have not used that example. mark zuckerberg: too simple. jonathan zittrain: you’re right and you knocked that one out of the park and, like, denver guardian, come up with more articles and be real and then come back and talk to us. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, here’s the harder case which is something that might be in an outlet that is, you know, viewed as legitimate, has a number of users, et cetera. so you can’t use the metadata as easily. imagine if somebody as they shared it out could say, “by the way, i want to follow this. i want to learn a little bit more about this.” they click a button that says that. and i also realized when i talked earlier to somebody at facebook on this that adding a new button to the homepage is, like, everybody’s first idea mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah. jonathan zittrain: and it’s– mark zuckerberg: but it’s a reasonable thought experiment, even though it would lead to a very bad ui. jonathan zittrain: fair enough. i understand this is already– mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughs> jonathan zittrain: in the land of fantasy. so they add the button. they say, “i want to follow up on this.” if enough people are clicking comparatively on the same thing to say, “i want to learn more about this. if anything else develops, let me know, facebook,” that, then, if i have my pneumatic tube, it then goes to a convened virtually panel of three librarians. we go to the librarians of the nation and the world at public and private libraries across the land who agree to participate in this program. maybe we set up a little foundation for it that’s endowed permanently and no long connected to whoever endowed it. and those librarians together discuss the piece and they come back with what they would tell a patron if somebody came up to them and said, “i’m about to cite this in my social studies paper. what do you think?” and librarians, like, live for questions like that. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm, yeah. jonathan zittrain: they’re like, “wow. let us tell you.” and they have a huge fiduciary notion of patron duty that says, “i may disapprove of you even studying this, whatever, but i’m here to serve you, the user.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: “and i just think you should know, this is why maybe it’s not such a good source.” and when they come up with that they can send it back and it gets pushed out to everybody who asks for follow-up– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and they can do with it as they will. and last piece of the puzzle, we have high school students who apprentice as librarian number three for credit. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and then they can get graded on how well they participated in this exercise which helps generate a new generation of librarian-themed people who are better off at reading things, so. mark zuckerberg: all right, well, i think you have a side goal here which i haven’t been thinking about on the librarian thing. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: which is the evil goal of promoting libraries. jonathan zittrain: well, it’s mark zuckerberg: no, but i mean, look, i think solving– preventing misinformation or spreading misinformation is hard enough without also trying to develop high school students in a direction. jonathan zittrain: ah. my colleague charlies foote– mark zuckerberg: so, that’s solving a problem with a problem. jonathan zittrain: all right. well, anyway, yes. mark zuckerberg: so i actually think i agree with most of what you have in there. it doesn’t need to be a button on the home page, it can be– i mean, it turns out that there’s so many people using these services that even if you get– even if you put something that looks like it’s not super prominent, like, behind the three dots on a given newsfeed story, you have the options, yeah, you’re not– not everyone is going tois going to like something. jonathan zittrain: if 1 out of 1000 do it, you still get 10,000 or 100,000 people, yeah. mark zuckerberg: you get pretty good signal. but i actually think you could do even better, which is, it’s not even clear that you need that signal. i think that that’s super helpful. i think really what matters is looking at stuff that’s getting a lot of distribution. so, you know, i think that there’s kind of this notion, and i’m going back to the encryption conversation, which is all right, if i say something that’s wrong to you in a one-on-one conversation, i mean, does that need to be fact checked? i mean, it’s, yeah, it would be good if you got the most accurate information. jonathan zittrain: i do have a personal librarian to accompany me for most conversations, yes. there you go. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: well, you are– jonathan zittrain: unusual. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. yes. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that’s the word i was looking for. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i’m not sure i believe you, but yes. mark zuckerberg: it’s– <laughs> but i think that there’s limited– i don’t think anyone would say that every message that goes back and forth in especially an encrypted messaging service should be jonathan zittrain: fact checked. mark zuckerberg: should be fact checked. jonathan zittrain: correct. mark zuckerberg: so i think the real question is all right, when something starts going viral or getting a lot of distribution, that’s when it becomes most socially important for it to be– have some level of validation or at least that we know where that the community in general thinks that this is a reasonable thing. so it’s actually, while it’s helpful to have the signal of whether people are flagging this as something that we should look at, i actually think increasingly you want to be designing systems that just prevent like alarming or sensational content from going viral in the first place. and making sure that that, that the stuff that is getting wide distribution is doing so because it’s high quality on whatever front you care about. so then, okay– jonathan zittrain: and that quality is still generally from poynter or some external party that mark zuckerberg: well, well quality has many dimensions. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but certainly accuracy is one dimension of it. you also, i mean, you pointed out i think in one of your questions, is this piece of content prone to incite outrage. if you don’t mind, i’ll get to your panel of three things in a second, but as a slight detour on this. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: one of the findings that has been quite interesting is, you know, there’s this question about whether social media in general increases, basically makes it so that sensationalist content gets the most distribution. and what we’ve found is that, all right, so we’re going to have rules, right, about what content is allowed. and what we found is that generally within whatever rules you set up, as content approaches the line of what is allowed, it often gets more distribution. so if you’ll have some rule on, you know, what– and take a completely different example and our nudity policies. right. it’s like, okay, you have to define what is unacceptable nudity in some way. as you get as close to that as possible it’s like, all right. like, this is maybe a photo of someone– jonathan zittrain: the skin to share ratio goes up until it gets banned at which point it goes to zero. mark zuckerberg: yes. okay. so that is a bad property of a system, right, that i think you want to generally address. or you don’t want to design a community where or systems for helping to build a community where things that get as close to the line as what is bad get the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so long as we have the premise, which in many cases is true, but i could probably try to think of some where it wouldn’t be true, that as you near the line, you are getting worse. mark zuckerberg: that’s a good point. that’s a good point. there’s– jonathan zittrain: you know, there might be humor that’s really edgy. mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: and that conveys a message that would be impossible to convey without the edginess, while not still– mark zuckerberg: that is– jonathan zittrain: but, i– mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so but then you get the question of what’s the cost benefit of allowing that. and obviously, where you can accurately separate what’s good and bad which you, like in the case of misinformation i’m not sure you could do it fully accurately, but you can try to build systems that approximate that, there’s certainly the issue, which is that, i mean, there is misinformation which leads to massive public harm, right. so if it’s misinformation that is also spreading hate and leading to genocide or public attacks or, it’s like, okay, we’re not going to allow that. right. that’s coming down. but then generally if you say something that’s wrong, we’re not going to try to block that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: we’re just going to try to not show it to people widely because people don’t want content that is wrong. so then the question is as something is approaching the line, how do you assess that? this is a general theme in a lot of the content governance and enforcement work that we’re doing, which is there’s one piece of this which is just making sure that we can as effectively as possible enforce the policies that exist. then there’s a whole other stream of work, which i called borderline content, which is basically this issue of as content approaches the line of being against the policies, how do you make sure that that isn’t the content that is somehow getting the most distribution? and a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that. jonathan zittrain: so this idea would be stuff that you’re kind of letting down easy without banning and letting down easy as it’s going to somehow have a coefficient of friction for sharing that goes up. it’s going to be harder– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for it to go viral. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and– mark zuckerberg: so it’s fascinating because it’s just against– like, you can take almost any category of policy that we have, so i used nudity a second ago. you know, gore and violent imagery. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: hate speech. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: any of these things. i mean, there’s, like, hate speech, there’s content that you would just say is mean or toxic, but that did not violate– but that you would not want to have a society that banned being able to say that thing. but it’s, but you don’t necessarily want that to be the content that is getting the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so here’s a classic transparency question around exactly that system you described. and when you described this, i think you did a post around this a few months ago. this was fascinating. you had graphs in the post depicting this, which was great. how would you feel about sharing back to the person who posted or possibly to everybody who encounters it its coefficient of friction? would that freak people out? would it be, like, all right, i– and in fact, they would then probably start conforming their posts, for better or worse,– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: to try to maximize the sharability. but that rating is already somewhere in there by design. would it be okay to surface it? mark zuckerberg: so, as a principle, i think that that would be good, but i don’t– the way that the systems are designed isn’t that you get a score of how inflammatory or sensationalist a piece of content is. the way that it basically works is you can build classifiers that identify specific types of things. right. so we’re going down the list of, like, all right, there’s 20 categories of harmful content that you’re trying to identify. you know, everything from terrorist propaganda on the one hand to self-harm issues to hate speech and election interference. and basically, each of these things while it uses a lot of the same underlying machine learning infrastructure, you’re doing specific work for each of them. so if you go back to the example on nudity for a second, you know, what you– you’re not necessarily scoring everything on a scale of not at all nude to nude. you[‘re basically enforcing specific policies. so, you know, you’re saying, “okay, if–” jonathan zittrain: so by machine learning it would just be give me an estimate of the odds by which if a human looked at it who was employed to enforce policy– mark zuckerberg: well, basically– jonathan zittrain: whether it violates the policy. mark zuckerberg: and you have a sense of, okay, this is– so what are the things that are adjacent to the policy, right? so you night say, okay, well, if the person is completely naked, that is something that you can definitely build a classifier to be able to identify with relatively high accuracy. but even if they’re not, you know, then the question is you kind of need to be able to qualitatively describe what are the things that are adjacent to that. so maybe the person is wearing a bathing suit and is in a sexually suggestive position. right. it’s not like any piece of content you’re going to score from not at all nude to nude. but you kind of have the cases for what you think are adjacent to the issues and, and again, you ground this and qualitatively, people, like, people might click on it, they might engage with it, but at the end, they don’t necessarily feel good about it. and you want to get at when you’re designing these systems not just what people do, but also you want to make sure we factor in, too, like is this the content that people say that they really want to be seeing? do they–? jonathan zittrain: the constitutional law, there’s a formal kind of definition that’s emerged for the word “prurient.” if something appeals to the prurient interest– mark zuckerberg: okay. jonathan zittrain: as part of a definition of obscenity, the famous miller test, which was not a beeroriented test. and part of a prurient interest is basically it excites me and yet it completely disgusts me. and it sounds like you’re actually converging to the supreme court’s vision of prurience with this. mark zuckerberg: maybe. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and it might be– don’t worry, i’m not trying to nail you down on that. but it’s very interesting that machine learning, which you invoked, is both really good, i gather, at something like this. it’s the kind of thing that’s like just have some people tell me with their expertise, does this come near to violating the policy or not and i’ll just through a spidey sense start to tell you whether it would. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm. jonathan zittrain: rather than being able to throw out exactly what the factors are. i know the person’s fully clothed, but it still is going to invoke that quality. so all of the benefits of machine learning and all of, of course, all the drawbacks where it classifies something and somebody’s like, “wait a minute. that was me doing a parody of blah, blah, blah.” that all comes to the fore. mark zuckerberg: yeah and i mean, when you ask people what they want to see in addition to looking at what they actually engage with, you do get a completely different sense of what people value and you can build systems that approximate that. but going back to your question, i think rather than giving people a score of the friction– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i think you can probably give people feedback of, “hey, this might make people uncomfortable in this way, in this specific way.” and this fits your– jonathan zittrain: it might affect how much it gets– how much it gets shared. mark zuckerberg: yeah. and this gets down to a different– there’s a different ai ethics question which i think is really important here, which is designing ai systems to be understandable by people jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: right and to some degree, you don’t just want it to spit out a score of how offensive or, like, where it scores on any given policy. you want it to be able to map to specific things that might be problematic. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s the way that we’re trying to design the systems overall. jonathan zittrain: yes. now we have something parked in the box we should take out, which is the external review stuff. but before we do, one other just transparency thing maybe to broach. it basically just occurred to me, i imagine it might be possible to issue me a score of how much i’ve earned for facebook this year. it could simply say, “this is how much we collected on the basis of you in particular being exposed to an ad.” <laughs> and i know sometimes people, i guess, might compete to get their numbers up. <laughs> but i’m just curious, would that be a figure? i’d kind of be curious to know, in part because it might even lay the groundwork of being like, “look, mark, i’ll double it. you can have double the money and then don’t show me any ads.” can we get a car off of that lot today? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: <laughs> okay, well, there’s a lot– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: there’s a lot in there. jonathan zittrain: it was a quick question. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> so there’s a question in what you’re saying which is so we built an ad-supported system. should we have an option for people to pay to not see ads. jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: i think is kind of what you’re saying. i mean, just as the basic primer from first principles on this. you know, we’re building this service. we want to give everyone a voice. we want everyone to be able to connect with who they care about. if you’re trying to build a service for everyone, jonathan zittrain: got to be free. that’s just <inaudible 01:04:45> mark zuckerberg: if you want them to use it, that’s just going to be the argument. yes, yes. jonathan zittrain: okay. all right. mark zuckerberg: so then, so this is a kind of a tried and true thing. there are a lot of companies over time that have been ad supported. in general what we find is that if people are going to see ads, they want them to be relevant. they don’t want them to be junk. right. so then within that you give people control over how their data is used to show them ads. but the vast majority of people say, like, show me the most relevant ads that you can because i get that i have to see ads. this is a free service. so now the question is, all right, so there’s a whole set of questions around that that we could get into, but but then jonathan zittrain: for which we did talk about enough to reopen it, the personalization exploitation. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: or even just philosophical question. right now, uber or lyft are not funded that way. we could apply this ad model to uber or lyft, “free rides. totally free. it’s just every fifth ride takes you to wendy’s and idles outside the drive through window.” <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “totally up to you what you want to do, but you’re going to sit here for a while,” and then you go on your way. i don’t know how– and status quo-ism would probably say people would have a problem with that, but it would give people rides that otherwise wouldn’t get rides. mark zuckerberg: i have not thought about that case in their– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: in their business, so, so– jonathan zittrain: well, that’s my patent, damn it, so don’t you steal it. mark zuckerberg: but certainly some services, i think tend themselves better towards being ad supported than others. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: okay and i think generally information-based ones tend to– jonathan zittrain: than my false imprisonment hypo, i’d– okay, fair enough. mark zuckerberg: i mean, that seems jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: there might be, you know, more– <laughs> more issues there. but okay, but go to the subscription thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: when people have questions about the ad model on facebook, i don’t think the questions are just about the ad model, i think they’re about both seeing ads and data use around ads. and the thing that i think, so when i think about this it’s, i don’t just think you want to let people pay to not see ads because i actually think then the question is the questions are around ads and data use and i don’t think people are going to be that psyched about not seeing ads but then not having different controls over how their data is used. okay, but now you start getting into a principle question which is are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people. and my answer to that is a hard no, right. so the prerequisite– jonathan zittrain: what’s an example of data use that isn’t ad-based, just so we know what we’re talking about? mark zuckerberg: that isn’t ad-based? jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: like what do you mean? jonathan zittrain: you were saying, i don’t want to see ads. but you’re saying that’s kind of just the wax on the car. what’s underneath is how the data gets used. mark zuckerberg: so, well, look– maybe– let me keep going with this explanation and then i think this’ll be clear. jonathan zittrain: yeah, sure. mark zuckerberg: so one of the things that we’ve been working on is this tool that we call clear history. and the basic idea is it is you can kind of analogize it to a web browser where you can clear your cookies. that’s kind of a normal thing. you know that when you clear your cookies you’re going to get logged out of a bunch of stuff. a bunch of stuff might get more annoying. jonathan zittrain: which is why my guess is, am i right, probably nobody clears their cookies. mark zuckerberg: i don’t know. jonathan zittrain: they might use incognito mode or something, but. mark zuckerberg: i think– i don’t know. how many of you guys clear your cookies every once in a while, right? jonathan zittrain: this is not a representative group, damn it. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. like, maybe once a year or something i’ll clear my cookies. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but no, it’s, i think– jonathan zittrain: happy new year. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, over some period of time, all right, but– jonathan zittrain: yeah, okay. mark zuckerberg: but not necessarily every day. but it’s important that people have that tool even though it might in a local sense make their experience worse. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: okay. so that kind of content of what different services, websites and apps send to facebook that, you know, we use to help measure the ads in effectiveness there, right, so things like, you know, if you’re an app developer and you’re trying to pay for ads to help grow your app, we want to only charge you when we actually, when something that we show leads to an install, not just whether someone sees the ad or clicks on it, but if they add– jonathan zittrain: that requires a whole infrastructure to, yeah. mark zuckerberg: okay, so then, yeah, so you build that out. it helps us show people more relevant ads. it can help show more relevant content. often a lot of these signals are super useful also on the security side for some of the other things that we’ve talked about, so that ends up being important. but fundamentally, you know, looking at the model today, it seems like you should have something like this ability to clear history. it turns out that it’s a much more complex technical project. i’d talked about this at our developer conference last year, about how i’d hoped that we’d roll it out by the end of 2018 and just, the plumbing goes so deep into all the different systems that it’s, that– but we’re still working on it and we’re going to do it. it’s just it’s taking a little bit longer. jonathan zittrain: so clear history basically means i am as if a newb, i just show mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: even though i’ve been using facebook for a while, it’s as if it knows nothing about me and it starts accreting again. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i’m just trying to think just as a plain old citizen, how would i make an informed judgment about how often to do that or when i should do it? what–? mark zuckerberg: well, hold on. let’s go to that in a second. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: but one thing, just to connect the dots on the last conversation. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. right. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay. right. that’s going to, if we’re going to give controls over data use, we’re going to do that for everyone in the community. so that’s the first thing that i think we need to go do. mark zuckerberg: so that’s, so that’s kind of– this is sort of the how we’re thinking about the projects and this is a really deep and big technical project but we’re committed to doing it because i think it’s that’s what it’s there for. [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: and i guess like an ad block or somebody could then write a little script for your browser that would just clear your history every time you visit or something. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, no, but the plan would also be to offer something that’s an ongoing thing. jonathan zittrain: i see. mark zuckerberg: in your browser, but i think the analogy here is you kind of have, in your browser you have the ability to clear your cookies. and then, like, in some other place you have under your, like, nuclear settings, like, don’t ever accept any cookies in my browser. and it’s like, all right, your browser’s not really going to work that well. jonathan zittrain: yeah. <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but, but you can do that if you want because you should have that control. i think that these are part and parcel, right. it’s i think a lot of people might go and clear their history on a periodic basis because they– or, or actually in the research that we’ve done on this as we’ve been developing it, the real thing that people have told us that they want is similar to cookie management, not necessarily wiping everything, because that ends in inconvenience of getting logged out of a bunch of things, but there are just certain services or apps that you don’t want that data to be connected to your facebook account. so having the ability on an ad hoc basis to go through and say, “hey, stop associating this thing,” is going to end up being a quite important thing that i think we want to try to deliver. so that’s, this is partially as we’re getting into this, it’s a more complex thing but i think it’s very valuable. and i think if any conversation around the– around subscriptions, i think you would want to start with giving people these, make sure that everyone has these kind of controls. so that’s, we’re kind of in the early phases of doing that. the philosophical downstream question of whether you also let people pay to not have ads, i don’t know. there were a bunch of questions around whether that’s actually a good thing, but i personally don’t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads. that all of the research that we have, it’s it may still end up being the right thing to offer that as a choice down the line, but all of the data that i’ve seen suggests that the vast, vast, vast majority of people want a free service and that the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: people like being able to get information from local businesses and things like that too, so. so there’s a lot of good there. jonathan zittrain: yeah. forty years ago it would have been the question of abc versus hbo and the answer turned out to be yes. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so you’re right. and people might have different things. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: there’s a little paradox lingering in there about if something’s so important and vital that we wouldn’t want to deprive anybody of access to it but therefore nobody gets it until we figured out how to remove it for everybody. mark zuckerberg: what we– [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: in other words, if i could buy my way out of ads and data collection it wouldn’t be fair to those who can’t and therefore we all subsist with it until the advances you’re talking about. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i guess what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle. it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong. so that to me is something that in any conversation about whether we’d evolve towards having a subscription service, i think you have to have these controls first and it’s a very deep thing. a technical problem to go do, but we’re– that’s why we’re working through that. jonathan zittrain: yes. so long as the privacy controls that we’re not able to buy our way into aren’t controls that people ought to have. you know, it’s just the kind of underlying question of is the system as it is that we can’t opt out of a fair system. and that’s of course, you know, you have to go into the details to figure out what you mean by it. but let’s in the remaining time we have left mark zuckerberg: how are we doing on time? jonathan zittrain: we’re good. we’re 76 minutes in. mark zuckerberg: all right, into– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’re going to get through maybe half the topics. jonathan zittrain: yeah, yeah, yeah. mark zuckerberg: and i’ll come back and do another one later. jonathan zittrain: i’m going to bring this in for a landing soon. on my agenda left includes such things as taking out of the box the independent review stuff, chat a little bit about that. i’d be curious, and this might be a nice thing, really, as we wrap up, which would be a sense of any vision you have for what would facebook look like in 10 or 15 years and how different would it be than the facebook of 10 years ago is compared to today. so that’s something i’d want to talk about. is there anything big on your list that you want to make sure we talk about? mark zuckerberg: those are good. those are good topics. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> fair enough. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> jonathan zittrain: so all right, the external review board. mark zuckerberg: yeah. so one of the big questions that i have just been thinking about is, you know, we make a lot of decisions around content enforcement and what stays up and what comes down. and having gone through this process over the last few years of working on the systems, one of the themes that i feel really strongly about is that we shouldn’t be making so many of these decisions ourselves. you know, one of the ways that i try to reason about this stuff is take myself out of the position of being ceo of the company, almost like a rawlsian perspective. if i was a different person, what would i want the ceo of the company to be able to do? and i would not want so many decisions about content to be concentrated with any individual. so– jonathan zittrain: it is weird to see big impactful, to use a terrible word, decisions about what a huge swath of humanity does or doesn’t see inevitably handled as, like, a customer service issue. it does feel like a mismatch, which is what i hear you saying. mark zuckerberg: so let’s, yeah, so i actually think the customer service analogy is a really interesting one. right. so when you email amazon, because they don’t, they make a mistake with your package, that’s customer support. right. i mean, they are trying to provide a service and generally, they can invest more in customer support and make people happier. we’re doing something completely different, right. when someone emails us with an issue or flags some content, they’re basically complaining about something that someone else in the community did. so it’s more like it’s almost more like a court system in that sense. doing more of that does not make people happy because in every one of those transactions one person ends up the winner and one is the loser. either you said that that content, that the content was fine, in which case the person complaining is upset, or you the someone’s content down, in which case the person is really upset because you’re now telling them that they don’t have the ability to express something that they feel is a valid thing that they should be able to express. so in some deep sense while some amount of what we do is customer support, people get locked out of their account, et cetera, you know, we now have, like, more than 30,000 people working on content review and safety review, doing the kind of judgments that, you know, it’s basically a lot of the stuff, we have machine learning systems that flag things that could be problematic in addition to people in the community flagging things, but making these assessments of whether the stuff is right or not. so one of the questions that i just think about, it’s like, okay, well, you have many people doing this. regardless of how much training they have, we’re going to make mistakes, right. so you want to start building in principles around, you know, what you would kind of think of as due process, right. so we’re building in an ability to have an appeal, right, which already is quite good in that we are able to overturn a bunch of mistakes that the first line people make in making these assessments. but at some level i think you also want a level of kind of independent appeal, right, where if, okay, let’s say, so the appeals go to maybe a higher level of facebook employee who is a little more trained in the nuances of the policies; but at some point, i think you also need an appeal to an independent groups, which is, like, is this policy fair? was this–? like is this piece of content really getting on the wrong side of the balance of free expression and safety? and i just don’t think at the end of the day that that’s something that you want centralized in a single company. so now the question is how do you design that system and that’s a real question, right, so that we don’t pretend to have the answers on this. what we’re basically working through is we have a draft proposal and we’re working with a lot of experts around the world to run a few pilots in the first half of this year that can hopefully we can codify into something that’s a longer term thing. but i just, i believe that this is just an incredibly important thing. as a person and if i take aside the role that i have as ceo of the company, i do not want the company being able to make all of those final decisions without a check and balance and accountability, so i want to use the position that i’m in to help build that kind of an institution. jonathan zittrain: yes. and when we talk about an appeal, then, it sounds like you could appeal two distinct things. one is this was the rule but it was applied wrong to me. this, in fact, was parody [ph?] so it shouldn’t be seen as near the line. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i want the independent body to look at that. the other would be the rule is wrong. the rule should change because– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and you’re thinking the independent body could weigh in on both of those? mark zuckerberg: yeah. over time, i would like the role of the independent oversight board to be able to expand to do additional things as well. i think the question is it’s hard enough to even set something up that’s going to codify the values that we have around expression and safety on a relatively defined topic. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so i think the question is if you kind of view this as an experiment in institution building where we’re trying to build this thing that is going to have real power tojonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i mean, like, i will not be able to make a decision that overturns what they say. which i think is good. i think also just it raises the stakes. you need to make sure we get this right, so. jonathan zittrain: it’s fascinating. it’s huge. i think the way you’re describing it, i wouldn’t want to understate– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: that this is not a usual way of doing business. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i think it– i think this is– i really care about getting this right. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but i think you want to start with something that’s relatively well-defined and then hopefully expand it to be able to cover more things over time. so in the beginning i think one question that could come up is my understanding, i mean, it’s always dangerous talking about legal precedence when i’m, this might be one of my first times at harvard law school. i did not spend a lot of time here<laughter> mark zuckerberg: when i was an undergrad. but, you know what i mean, the, if the supreme court overturns something, they don’t tell congress what the law should be, they just say there’s an issue here, right. and then basically there’s a process. all right. so if i’m getting that wrong<laughter> mark zuckerberg: all right. i shouldn’t have done that. jonathan zittrain: no, no. that’s quite honest. [ph?] mark zuckerberg: i knew that was dangerous. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: and that that was a mistake. jonathan zittrain: there are people who do agree with you. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. oh, so that’s an open question that that’s how it works. jonathan zittrain: it’s a highly debated question, yes. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: there’s the i’m just the umpire calling balls and strikes and in fact, the first type of question we brought up, which was, “hey, we get this is the standard. does it apply here?” lends itself a little more to, you know, you get three swings and if you miss them all, like, you can’t keep playing. the umpire can usher you away from the home plate. this is, i’m really digging deep into my knowledge now of baseball. there’s another thing about, like,– mark zuckerberg: that’s okay. i’m not the person who’s going to call you out on getting something wrong there. jonathan zittrain: i appreciate that. mark zuckerberg: that’s why i also need to have a librarian next to me at all times. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: very good. i wonder how much librarians tend to know about baseball. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: aww. jonathan zittrain: but we digress. ah, we’re going to get letters, mentions. mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: but whether or not the game is actually any good with a three strikes rule, maybe there should be two or four or whatever, starts to ask of the umpire more than just, you know, your best sense of how that play just went. both may be something. both are surely beyond standard customer service issues, so both could maybe be usefully externalized. what you’d ask the board to do in the category one kind of stuff maybe it’s true that, like, professional umpirage [ph?] could help us and there are people who are jurists who can do that worldwide. for the other, whether it’s the supreme jonathan zittrain: –court, or the so-called common law and state courts where often a state supreme court will be like, “henceforth, 50 feet needs to be the height of a baseball net,” and like, “if you don’t agree, legislature, we’ll hear from you, but until then it’s 50 feet.” they really do kind of get into the weeds. they derive maybe some legitimacy for decisions like that from being close to their communities, and it really regresses them to a question of: is facebook a global community, a community of 2.x billion people worldwide, transcending any national boundaries, and for which i think so far on these issues, it’s meant to be, “the rule is the rule,” it doesn’t really change in terms of service from one place to anotherversus how much do we think of it as somehow localized– whether or not localized through governmentbut where different local communities make their own judgments? mark zuckerberg: that is one of the big questions. i mean, right now we have community standards that are global. we follow local laws, as you say. but i think the idea is– i don’t think we want to end up in a place where we have very different norms in different places, but you want to have some sense of representation and making sure that the body that can deliberate on this has a good diversity of views. so these are a lot of the things that we’re trying to figure out, is like: well, how big is the body? when decisions are made, are they made by the whole body, or do you have panels of people that are smaller sets? if there are panels, how do you make sure that you’re not just getting a random sample that kind of skews in the values perspective towards one thing? so then there a bunch of mechanisms like, okay, maybe one panel that’s randomly constituted decides on whether the board will take up a question or one of the issues, but then a separate random panel of the group actually does the decisions, so that way you eliminate some risk that any given panel is going to be too ideologically skewed. so there’s a bunch of things that i think we need to think through and work through, but the goal on this is to, over time, have it grow into something that can provide greater accountability and oversight to potentially more of the hard questions that we face, but i think it’s so high-stakes that starting with something that’s relatively defined is going to be the right way to go in the beginning. so regardless of the fact that i was unaware of the controversy around the legal point that i made a second ago, i do think in our case it makes sense to start with not having this group say what the policies are going to be, but just have there be– have it be able to say, “hey, we think that you guys are on the wrong side on this, and maybe you should rethink where the policy is because we think you’re on the wrong side.” there’s one other thing that i think is worth calling out, which is in a typical kind of judicial analog, or at least here in the u.s., my understanding, is there’s the kind of appeal route to the independent board considering an issue, but i also think that we want to have an avenue where we as the company can also just raise hard issues that come up to the board without having– which i don’t actually know if there’s any mechanism for that. jonathan zittrain: it’s called an advisory opinion. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: but under u.s. federal law, it’s not allowed because of article iii case or controversy requirement, but state courts do it all the time. you’ll have a federal court sometimes say– because it’s a federal court but it’s deciding something under state law. it’ll be like, “i don’t know, ask florida.” and they’ll be like, “hey florida,” and then florida is just florida. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: sure. so i think that– jonathan zittrain: so you can do an advisory opinion. mark zuckerberg: –that’ll end up being an important part of this too. we’re never going to be able to get out of the business of making frontline judgments. we’ll have the ai systems flag content that they think is against policies or could be, and then we’ll have people– this set of 30 thousand people, which is growing– that is trained to basically understand what the policies are. we have to make the frontline decisions, because a lot of this stuff needs to get handled in a timely way, and a more deliberative process that’s thinking about the fairness and the policies overall should happen over a different timeframe than what is often relevant, which is the enforcement of the initial policy. but i do think overall for a lot of the biggest questions, i just want to build a more independent process. jonathan zittrain: well, as you say, it’s an area with fractal complexity in the best of ways, and it really is terra incognito, and it’d be exciting to see how it might be built out. i imagine there’s a number of law professors around the world, including some who come from civil rather than common law jurisdictions, who are like, “this is how it works over here,” from which you could draw. another lingering question would be– lawyers often have a bad reputation. i have no idea why. but they often are the glue for a system like this so that a judge does not have to be oracular or omniscient. there’s a process where the lawyer for one side does a ton of work and looks at prior decisions of this board and says, “well, this is what would be consistent,” and the other lawyer comes back, and then the judge just gets to decide between the two, rather than having to just know everything. there’s a huge tradeoff here for every appealed content decision, how much do we want to build it into a case, and you need experts to help the parties, versus they each just sort of come before solomon and say, “this kind of happened,” and– or judge judy maybe is a more contemporary reference. mark zuckerberg: somewhere between the two, yeah. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: yeah. so it’s a lot of stuff– and for me, i both find myself– i don’t know if this is the definition of prurient– both excited by it and somewhat terrified by it, but very much saying that it’s better than a status quo, which is where i think you and i are completely agreeing, and maybe a model for other firms out there. so that’s the last question in this area that pops to my mind, which is: what part of what you’re developing at facebook– a lot of which is really resource-intensive– is best thought of as a public good to be shared, including among basically competitors, versus, “that’s part of our comparative advantage and our secret sauce”? if you develop a particularly good algorithm that can really well detect fake news or spammers or bad actors– you’ve got the phds, you’ve got the processors– is that like, “in your face, schmitter [ph?],” or is like, “we should have somebody that– some body– that can help democratize that advance”? and it could be the same to be said for these content decisions. how do you think about that? mark zuckerberg: yeah, so certainly the threat-sharing and security work that you just referenced is a good area where there’s much better collaboration now than there was historically. i think that that’s just because everyone recognizes that it’s such a more important issue. and by the way, there’s much better collaboration with governments now too on this, and not just our own here in the u.s., and law enforcement, but around the world with election commissions and law enforcement, because there’s just a broad awareness that these are issues and that– jonathan zittrain: especially if you have state actors in the mix as the adversary. mark zuckerberg: yes. so that’s certainly an area where there’s much better collaboration now, and that’s good. there’s still issues. for example, if you’re law enforcement or intelligence and you have developed a– “source” is not the right word– but basically if you’ve identified someone as a source of signals that you can watch and learn about, then you may not want to come to us and tell us, “hey, we’ve identified that this state actor is doing this bad thing,” because then the natural thing that we’re going to want to do is make sure that they’re not on our system doing bad things, or that they’re not– either they’re not in the system at all or that we’re interfering with the bad things that they’re trying to do. so there’s some mismatch of incentives, but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, “hey, this is what we’re at.” so i just think having that kind of baseline where you build that up over time is helpful. and i think on security and safety is probably the biggest area of that kind of collaboration now, across all the different types of threats; not just election and democratic process type stuff, but any kind of safety issue. the other area where i tend to think about what we’re doing is– it should be open– is just technical infrastructure overall. i mean, that is probably a less controversial piece, but we open-source a lot of the basic stuff that runs our systems, and i think that that is a– that’s a contribution that i’m quite proud of that we do. we have sort of pioneered this way of thinking about how people connect, and the data model around that is more of a graph, and the idea of graph database and a lot of the infrastructure for being able to efficiently access that kind of content i think is broadly applicable beyond the context of a social network. when i was here as an undergrad, even though i wasn’t here for very long, i studied psychology and computer science, and to me– i mean, my grounding philosophy on this stuff is that basically people should be at the center of more of the technology that we build. i mean, one of the early things that i kind of recognized when i was a student was like– at the time, there were internet sites for finding almost anything you cared about, whether it’s books or music or news or information or businesses– but as people, we think about the world primarily in terms of other people, not in terms of other objects, not cutting things up in terms of content or commerce or politics or different things, but it’s like– the stuff should be organized around the connections that people have, where people are at the centerpiece of that, and one of the missions that i care about is over time just pushing more technology development in the tech industry overall to develop things with that mindset. i think– and this is a little bit of a tangentbut the way that our phones work today, and all computing systems, organized around apps and tasks is fundamentally not how people– how our brains work and how we approach the world. it’s not– so that’s one of the reasons why i’m just very excited longer-term about especially things like augmented reality, because it’ll give us a platform that i think actually is how we think about stuff. we’ll be able to bring the computational objects into the world but fundamentally we’ll be interacting as people around them. the whole thing won’t be organized around an app or a task; it’ll be organized around people, and that i think is a much more natural and human system for how our technology should be organized. so opensourcing all of that infrastructure– to do that, and enabling not just us but other companies to kind of get that mindset into more of their thinking and the technical underpinning of that, is just something that i care really deeply about. jonathan zittrain: well, this is nice, and this is bringing us in for our landing, because we’re talking about 10, 20, 30 years ahead. as a term of art, i understand augmented reality to mean, “i’ve got a visor”version 0.1 was google glass– something where i’m kind of out in the world but i’m literally online at the same time because there’s data coming at me in some– that’s what you’re talking about, correct? mark zuckerberg: yeah, although it really should be glasses like what you have. i think we’ll probablymaybe they’ll have to be a little bigger, but not too much bigger or else it would start to get weird. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: so i don’t think a visor is going to catch. i don’t think anyone is psyched about that feature. jonathan zittrain: and anything involving surgery starts to sound a little bad too. mark zuckerberg: no, no, we’re definitely focused on– <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: –on external things. although– jonathan zittrain: like, “don’t make news, don’t make news, don’t make news.” <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. although we have showed this demo of basically can someone type by thinking, and of course when you’re talking about brain-computer interfaces, there’s two dimensions of that work. there’s the external stuff, and there’s the internal stuff, and invasive, and yes, of course if you’re actually trying to build things that everyone is going to use, you’re going to want to focus on the noninvasive things. jonathan zittrain: yes. can you type by thinking? mark zuckerberg: you can. jonathan zittrain: it’s called a ouija board. no. but you’re subvocalizing enough or there’s enough of a read of– mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. so there’s actually a bunch of the research here– there’s a question of throughput and how quickly can you type and how many bits can you express efficiently, but the basic foundation for the research is someone– a bunch of folks who are doing this research showed a bunch of people images– i think it was animals– so, “here’s an elephant, here’s a giraffe”– while having kind of a net on their head, noninvasive, but shining light and therefore looking at the level of blood activity andjust blood flow and activity in the brain– trained a machine learning basically on what the pattern of that imagery looked like when the person was looking at different animals, then told the person to think about an animal, right? so think about– just pick one of the animals to think about, and can predict what the person was thinking about in broad strokes just based on matching the neural activity. so the question is, so you can use that to type. jonathan zittrain: fifth amendment implications are staggering. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: sorry. mark zuckerberg: well, yes. i mean, presumably this would be something that someone would choose to use a product. i’m not– yeah, yeah. i mean, yes, there’s of course all the other implications, but yeah, i think that this is going to be– that’s going to be an interesting thing down the line. jonathan zittrain: but basically your vision then for a future– mark zuckerberg: i don’t know how we got onto that. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: you can’t blame me. i think you brought this up. mark zuckerberg: i did, but of all the things that– i mean, this is exciting, but we haven’t even covered yet how we should talk about– tech regulation and all this stuff i figured we’d get into. i mean, we’ll be here for like six or seven hours. i don’t know how many days you want to spend here to talking about this, but– jonathan zittrain: “we’re here at the zuckerberg center and hostage crisis.” <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: “the building is surrounded.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. but i think a little bit on future tech and research is interesting too, so. jonathan zittrain: please. mark zuckerberg: yeah, we’re good. jonathan zittrain: oh, we did cover it, is what you’re saying. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: i mean, but going back to your question about what– if this is the last topic– what i’m excited about for the next 10 or 20 years– i do think over the long term, reshaping our computing platforms to be fundamentally more about people and how we process the world is a really fundamental thing. over the nearer term– so call it five years– i think the clear trend is towards more private communication. if you look at all of the different ways that people want to share and communicate across the internet– but we have a good sense of the cross-strength, everything from one-on-one messages to kind of broadcasting publicly– the thing that is growing the fastest is private communication. right? so between whatsapp and messenger, and instagram now, just the number of private messages– it’s about 100 billion a day through those systems alone, growing very quickly, growing much faster than the amount that people want to share or broadcast into a feed-type system. of the type of broadcast content that people are doing, the thing that is growing by far the fastest is stories. right? so ephemeral sharing of, “i’m going to put this out, but i want to have a timeframe after which the data goes away.” so i think that that just gives you a sense of where the hub of social activity is going. it also is how we think about the strategy of the company. i mean, people– when we talk about privacy, i think a lot of the questions are often about privacy policies and legal or policy-type things, and privacy as a thing not to be breached, and making sure that you’re within the balance of what is good. but i actually think that there’s a much more– there’s another element of this that’s really fundamental, which is that people want tools that give them new contexts to communicate, and that’s also fundamentally about giving people power through privacy, not just not violating privacy, right? so not violating privacy is a backstop, but actually– you can kind of think about all the success that facebook has had– this is kind of a counterintuitive thing– has been because we’ve given people new private or semi-private ways to communicate things that they wouldn’t have had before. so thinking about facebook as an innovator in privacy is certainly not the mainstream view, but going back to the very first thing that we did, making it so harvard students could communicate in a way that they had some confidence that their content and information would be shared with only people within that community, there was no way that people had to communicate stuff at that scale, but not have it either be completely public or with just a small set of people before. and people’s desire to be understood and express themselves and be able to communicate with all different kinds of groups is, in the experience that i’ve had, nearly unbounded, and if you can give people new ways to be able to communicate safely and express themselves, then that is something that people just have a deep thirst and desire for. so encryption is really important, because i mean, we take for granted in the u.s. that there’s good rule of law, and that the government isn’t too much in our business, but in a lot of places around the world, especially where whatsapp is the biggest, people can’t take that for granted. so having it so that you really have confidence that you’re sharing something one-on-one and it’s not– and it really is one-on-one, it’s not one-on-one and the government there– actually makes it so people can share things that they wouldn’t be comfortable otherwise doing it. that’s power that you’re giving people through building privacy innovations. stories i just think is another example of this, where there are a lot of things that people don’t want as part of the permanent record but want to express, and it’s not an accident that that is becoming the primary way that people want to share with all of their friends, not putting something in a feed that goes on their permanent record. there will always be a use for that too– people want to have a record and there’s a lot of value that you can build around that– you can have longer-term discussions– it’s harder to do that around stories. there’s different value for these things. but over the next five years, i think we’re going to see all of social networking kind of be reconstituted around this base of private communication, and that’s something that i’m just very excited about. i think that that’s– it’s going to unlock a lot of people’s ability to express themselves and communicate things that they haven’t had the tools to do before, and it’s going to be the foundation for building a lot of really important tools on top of that too. jonathan zittrain: that’s so interesting to me. i would not have predicted that direction for the next five years. i would have figured, “gosh, if you already know with whom you want to speak, there are so many tools to speak with them,” some of which are end-to-end, some of which aren’t, some of which are rollyourown and open-source, and there’s always a way to try to make that easier and better, but that feels a little bit to me like a kind of crowded space, not yet knowing of the innovations that might lie ahead and means of communicating with the people you already know you want to talk to. and for that, as you say, if that’s where it’s at, you’re right that encryption is going to be a big question, and otherwise technical design so that if the law comes knocking on the door, what would the company be in a position to say. this is the apple iphone cupertino– sorry, san bernardino case– and it also calls to mind will there be peer-to-peer implementations of the things you’re thinking about that might not even need the server at all, and it’s basically just an app that people use, and if it’s going to deliver an ad, it can still do that appside, and how much governments will abide it. they have not, for the most part, demanded technology mandates to reshape how the technology works. they’re just saying, “if you’ve got it”– in part you’ve got it because you want to serve ads– “we want it.” but if you don’t even have it, it’s been rare for the governments to say, “well, you’ve got to build your system to do it.” it did happen with the telephone system back in the day. calea, the communications assistance to law enforcement act, did have federal law in the united states saying, “if you’re in the business of building a phone network, at&t, you’ve got to make it so we can plug in as you go digital,” and we haven’t yet seen those mandates in the internet software side so much. so we can see that coming up again. but it’s so funny, because if you’d asked me, i would have figured it’s encountering people you haven’t met before and interacting with them, for which all of the stuff about air traffic control of what goes into your feed and how much your stuff gets shared– all of those issues start to rise to the fore, and it gets me thinking about, “i ought to be able to make a feed recipe that’s my recipe, and fills it according to facebook variables, but i get to say what the variables are.” but i could see that if you’re just thinking about people communicating with the people they already know and like, that is a very different realm. mark zuckerberg: it’s not necessarily– it’s not just the people that you already know. i do think– we’ve really focused on friends and family for the last 10 or 15 years, and i think a big part of what we’re going to focus on now is around building communities in different ways and all the utility that you can build on top of, once you have a network like this in place. so everything from how people can do commerce better to things like dating, which is– a lot of dating happens on our services, but we haven’t built any tools specifically for that. jonathan zittrain: i do remember the facebook joint experiment– “experiment” is such a terrible wordstudy, by which one could predict when two facebook members are going to declare themselves in a relationship, months ahead of the actual declaration. i was thinking some of the ancillary products were in-laws. mark zuckerberg: that was very early. yeah. so you’re right that a lot of this is going to be about utility that you can build on top of it, but a lot of these things are fundamentally private, right? so if you’re thinking about commerce, that people have a higher expectation for privacy, and the question is: is the right context for that going to be around an app like facebook, which is broad, or an app like instagram? i think part of it is– the discovery part of it, i think we’ll be very well served there– but then we’ll also transition to something that people want to be more private and secure. anyhow, we could probably go on for many hours on this, but maybe we should save this for the round 2 of this that we’ll do in the future. jonathan zittrain: indeed. so thanks so much for coming out, for talking at such length, for covering such a kaleidoscopic range of topics, and we look forward to the next time we see you. mark zuckerberg: yeah. thanks. jonathan

"massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate elizabeth warren made waves yesterday when she outlined her plan for breaking up big tech companies like amazon, google and facebook. now, the verge reports warren also wants to break up apple. this, of course, makes sense given that apple falls into the bucket of a platform utility with more than $25 billion in global annual revenues. specifically, warren believes apple should not be able to both run the apple app store and distribute apps in it. “it’s got to be one or the other,” warren told the verge. “either they run the platform or they play in the store. they don’t get to do both at the same time.” warren’s proposal includes passing legislation to designate companies that offer marketplaces, exchanges or platforms for connecting third-parties with annual global revenues of more than $25 billion as “platform utilities.” “these companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,” warren wrote on medium yesterday. “platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.” that would mean amazon, for example, would not be able to sell its amazon basics line of products on its marketplace. same goes for apple, under warren’s proposal. “if you run a platform where others come to sell, then you don’t get to sell your own items on the platform because you have two comparative advantages,” warren said. “one, you’ve sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you’ve made a decision about what you’re going to sell. and second, you have the capacity — because you run the platform — to prefer your product over anyone else’s product. it gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.” in a comment to techcrunch, a spokesperson for warren confirmed that apple is indeed covered by her policy. “they are above $25 billion in revenue and so they would have to structurally separate – choosing between, for example, running the app store or offering their own apps,” the spokesperson said. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook"
"if you like the idea of amazon’s echo spot — that is, a tiny voice-powered assistant on your nightstand, complete with a full-color display — but are more into google assistant than alexa, your options have thus far been a bit limited. you could put your phone on a dock, but that’s not quite the same. there’s google home hub, but it’s a bit big for a nightstand with limited space. with that in mind, lenovo is building smart clock — an $80 google assistant-powered device built for the bedside. it’s got a four-inch 480×800 touchscreen on the face, which can show stuff like the weather when it’s not acting as a clock. if you sync it up with your google calendar, it’ll also try to give you a heads up when you need to shift your normal alarm wake-up time. it’s got one small built-in speaker for tunes, and a rear usb port for charging other devices. they wrapped the whole thing in a soft grey fabric, which in addition to making it fit right in with any google home devices you might have, looks pretty dang snazzy for an $80 device. and with google assistant at the core, of course, it can handle everything you might otherwise use something like google home for — voice-powered automation, controlling your tv, etc. unlike the echo spot, lenovo’s clock has no built-in camera — which, given that it’s meant to live in the bedroom, is probably a fine decision. google says this one should ship sometime this spring."
"just imagine, a pair of noise-canceling headphones without a smart assistant on-board. what is this, 2017? thankfully, sony used its ces press conference today to announce that it’s finally addressing its well-received wh-1000xm3’s lack of alexa. the headphones will be getting amazon’s smart assistant via a firmware update at some point during the first quarter of this year. tapping a button will trigger alexa, who can perform a variety of different media playback tasks, like playing music, changing tracks, along with more standard smart assistant fare, including connected home device control. along with the wh-1000xm3, the firmware update will also work with their predecessor, the wh-1000xm2, as well as the wh-1000x in-ear model. it seems our long national nightmare of not having alexa on every single gadget is finally drawing to a close."
"roku this morning announced its devices will now be compatible with amazon’s alexa. through a new roku skill for alexa, roku owners will be able to control their devices in order to do things like launch a channel, play or pause a show, search for entertainment options and more. roku tv owners will additionally be able to control various functions related to their television, like adjusting the volume, turning on and off the tv, switching inputs and changing channels if there is an over-the-air antenna attached. the added support for amazon alexa will be available to devices running roku os 8.1 or higher, and will require that customers enable the new roku skill, which will link their account to amazon. roku has developed its own voice assistant designed specifically for its platform, which is available with a touch of a button on its voice remote as well as through optional accessories like its voice-powered wireless speakers, tabletop roku touch remote or tcl’s roku-branded smart soundbar. however, it hasn’t ignored the needs of those who have invested in other voice platforms. already, roku devices work with google assistant-powered devices, like google home and google home mini, through a similar voice app launched last fall. support for the dominant streaming media platform — amazon alexa — was bound to be next. emarketer said amazon took two-thirds of smart speaker sales last year, and cirp said echo has a 70 percent u.s. market share. the roku app will work with any alexa-enabled device, including the amazon echo, echo show, echo dot, echo spot and echo plus, as well as those powered by alexa from third parties, the company confirmed to techcrunch. once enabled, you’ll be able to say things like “alexa, pause roku,” or “alexa, open hulu on roku,” or “alexa, find comedies on roku,” and more. the key will be starting the command with “alexa,” as usual, then specify “roku” is where the action should take place (e.g. “on roku”). one change with the launch of voice support via alexa is that the commands are a bit more natural, in some cases. whereas google assistant required users to say “hey google, pause on roku,” the company today says the same command for alexa users is “alexa, pause roku.” that’s a lot easier to remember and say. however, most of the other commands are fairly consistent between the two platforms. “consumers often have multiple voice ecosystems in their homes,” said ilya asnis, senior vice president of roku os at roku, in a statement about the launch. “by allowing our customers to choose alexa, in addition to roku voice search and controls, and other popular voice assistants, we are strengthening the value roku offers as a neutral platform in home entertainment.”"
"more than 100 million devices with amazon’s alexa assistant pre-installed have been sold, the company said friday. the new metric, revealed by amazon devices svp dave limp in an interview with the verge, showcases just how quickly the company has crammed the voice assistant into disparate hardware devices and shoved them out the door. the company did not distinguish further how many of these items were amazon-built echo devices and how many were designed by third-party oems. the long list of new alexa devices amazon announced at its hardware event the company’s vision of encapsulating alexa in anything with a circuit board was evident at its september hardware event where it announced more than a dozen new devices, including a clock, a microwave and some redesigns of existing products like the echo. in the interview, limp shares that there are more than 150 alexa-integrated hardware devices on the market, most of which shipped in 2018. when it comes to the 100 million number, that metric seems impressive for a platform that still seems to have so much room left to mature, but it also shows how aggressive the company has had to be to keep up with google assistant and siri, which obviously have significant reach on android and ios, respectively. alexa seems to occupy a more exclusive smart home presence than google, which has managed to ship quite a few of its google home devices, especially the google home mini. google home mini was the best-selling smart speaker in q2 amazon’s low-cost echo dot similarly seems to be capturing the bulk of attention. the device was updated in september with a new design and a louder speaker. the company is also seeing success with hardware it hasn’t released yet; the company revealed that they’ve had more than 1 million people sign up for an invite to buy an alexa auto device ahead of its launch."
"glossier, known for its line of understated makeup products and a cult-following of millennial instagrammers, is getting colorful with the launch of its first spin-off brand, glossier play. the company — led by founder and chief executive officer emily weiss, who built the nearly $400 million business from a makeup blog called into the gloss — has raised a total of $92 million in venture capital funding from top-tier consumer investors forerunner ventures, index ventures and ivp. stitch fix founder katrina lake and forerunner founder and general partner kirsten green, are among the company’s board members. weiss introduced glossier in 2014 as a clean-skincare and natural beauty advocate. today, the direct-to-consumer business boasts a growing line of barely there makeup, designed to mimic weiss’s own subtle, au naturale vibe. the launch of glossier play, inspired by 1970s’ nostalgia, is its first foray into bright colors, glitter and, in the brand’s own words, “dialed-up extras.” glossier play’s initial line-up of “extras” includes colored eyeliners ($15), highlighters ($20), multi-purpose glitter gel ($14) and the “vinylic lip” ($16). customers can purchase “the playground,” a set that includes each of the new products, for $60. introducing glossier play! a brand of dialed-up beauty extras that make getting ready the best part about going out. four new makeup products at https://t.co/4pxdm67e2r pic.twitter.com/ulrrc9ycn3 — glossier (@glossier) march 4, 2019 the advertising campaign for the instagram -friendly line will be led by none other than instagram star donté colley, as well as pop musician troye sivan. the new line and future spin-offs will help glossier compete with beauty incumbents, estée lauder and l’oréal, for example, in a market estimated to be worth $750 billion by 2024. glossier, headquartered in new york, counts 200 employees, meager in comparison to its nearly 2 million — and growing — social media following. the company surpassed $100 million in annual revenue in 2018, it tells techcrunch, and acquired 1 million new customers. in total, glossier retails 29 products across skincare, makeup, body, and fragrance. the company won’t be introducing additional brands this year and clarified it is not a brand incubator. glossier ceo emily weiss on why the company won’t sell on amazon"
"kohler, the company established in 1873 and best known for its plumbing products, has shown little restraint in the connected home era. the company debuted a connected appliance platform called kohler konnect at ces 2018, and the push continues this year. feast your eyes on the kohler numi 2.0. this is an intelligent toilet that uses surround sound speakers and dynamic ambient lighting systems to hopefully immerse you in an environment so tranquil, so idyllic, that you actually forget you’re sitting on a toilet. the numi 2.0 also comes with personalized cleansing and dryer functions as well as a heated seat. plus, the numi 2.0 also provides a little company in the form of amazon’s alexa voice assistant. (if instagram isn’t enough.) this is also the first year that kohler is releasing an entire collection of products that work together on the konnect platform. the veil lighted bathroom collection includes a freestanding bath, lighted mirror, and lighted three-piece vanity alongside the numi toilet and an integrated lighting system, all powered by voice. with the complete collection, users can create various ‘moods’ within the app, which will then be automatically conveyed via audio and lighting within the bathrooms based on the users’ own parameters. the veil lighted bathroom collection also comes with support for both amazon alexa and google assistant. kohler is also pledging to actually release a few of the items it hyped at ces 2018, including smartfill technology on some of its bathtubs, and a voice-powered shower interface that allows customizable presets around sound, light, water and steam. still no word around pricing for these new smart bathroom products, but interested humans can check out the kohler website. (be forewarned: the website autoplays rather dramatic music.)"
"last week brought an extraordinary demonstration of the dangers of operating a surveillance state — especially a shabby one, as china’s apparently is. an unsecured database exposed millions of records of chinese muslims being tracked via facial recognition — an ugly trifecta of prejudice, bureaucracy and incompetence. the security lapse was discovered by victor gevers at the gdi foundation, a security organization working in the public’s interest. using the infamous but useful shodan search engine, he found a mongodb instance owned by the chinese company sensenets that stored an ever-increasing number of data points from a facial recognition system apparently at least partially operated by the chinese government. many of the targets of this system were uyghur muslims, an ethnic and religious minority in china that the country has persecuted in what it considers secrecy, isolating them in remote provinces in what amount to religious gulags. this database was no limited sting operation: some 2.5 million people had their locations and other data listed in it. gevers told me that data points included national id card number with issuance and expiry dates; sex; nationality; home address; dob; photo; employer; and known previously visited face detection locations. this data, gevers said, plainly “had been visited multiple times by visitors all over the globe. and also the database was ransacked somewhere in december by a known actor,” one known as warn, who has previously ransomed poorly configured mongodb instances. so it’s all out there now. a bad idea, poorly executed, with sad parallels courtesy: victor gevers/gdi.foundation first off, it is bad enough that the government is using facial recognition systems to target minorities and track their movements, especially considering the treatment many of these people have already received. the ethical failure on full display here is colossal, but unfortunately no more than we have come to expect from an increasingly authoritarian china. using technology as a tool to track and influence the populace is a proud bullet point on the country’s security agenda, but even allowing for the cultural differences that produce something like the social credit rating system, the wholesale surveillance of a minority group is beyond the pale. (and i say this in full knowledge of our own problematic methods in the u.s.) chinese police are using smart glasses to identify potential suspects but to do this thing so poorly is just embarrassing, and should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks a surveillance state can be well administrated — in congress, for example. we’ve seen security tech theater from china before, in the ineffectual and likely barely functioning ar displays for scanning nearby faces, but this is different — not a stunt but a major effort and correspondingly large failure. the duty of monitoring these citizens was obviously at least partially outsourced to sensenets (note this is different from sensetime, but many of the same arguments will apply to any major people-tracking tech firm), which in a way mirrors the current controversy in the u.s. regarding amazon’s rekognition and its use — though on a far, far smaller scale — by police departments. it is not possible for federal or state actors to spin up and support the tech and infrastructure involved in such a system on short notice; like so many other things, the actual execution falls to contractors. and as sensenets shows, these contractors can easily get it wrong, sometimes disastrously so. mongodb, it should be said, is not inherently difficult to secure; it’s just a matter of choosing the right settings in deployment (settings that are now but were not always the defaults). but for some reason people tend to forget to check those boxes when using the popular system; over and over we’ve seen poorly configured instances being accessible to the public, exposing hundreds of thousands of accounts. this latest one must surely be the largest and most damaging, however. shodan safari, where hackers heckle the worst devices put on the internet gevers pointed out that the server was also highly vulnerable to mysql exploits among other things, and was of course globally visible on shodan. “so this was a disaster waiting to happen,” he said. in fact it was a disaster waiting to happen twice; the company re-exposed the database a few days after securing it, after i wrote this story but before i published: dear operators of sensenets.it's a good thing you starting update that crappy windows server 2012 (which is pirated btw). but you switched off the firewall exposing your mongodb and mysql server again. 🤗 pic.twitter.com/waelsctdqq — victor gevers (@0xdude) february 17, 2019 living in a glass house the truth is, though, that any such centralized database of sensitive information is a disaster waiting to happen, for pretty much everyone involved. a facial recognition database full of carefully organized demographic data and personal movements is a hell of a juicy target, and as the sensetimes instance shows, malicious actors foreign and domestic will waste no time taking advantage of the slightest slip-up (to say nothing of a monumental failure). we know major actors in the private sector fail at this stuff all the time and, adding insult to injury, are not held responsible — case in point: equifax. we know our weapons systems are hackable; our electoral systems are trivial to compromise and under active attack; the census is a security disaster; and unsurprisingly the agencies responsible for making all these rickety systems are themselves both unprepared and ignorant, by the government’s own admission… not to mention unconcerned with due process. fbi built a massive facial recognition database without proper oversight the companies and governments of today are simply not equipped to handle the enormousness, or recognize the enormity, of large-scale surveillance. not only that, but the people that compose those companies and governments are far from reliable themselves, as we have seen from repeated abuse and half-legal uses of surveillance technologies for decades. naturally we must also consider the known limitations of these systems, such as their poor record with people of color, the lack of transparency with which they are generally implemented and the inherently indiscriminate nature of their collection methods. the systems themselves are not ready. a failure at any point in the process of legalizing, creating, securing, using or administrating these systems can have serious political consequences (such as the exposure of a national agenda, which one can imagine could be held for ransom), commercial consequences (who would trust sensenets after this? the government must be furious) and, most importantly, personal consequences — to the people whose data is being exposed. and this is all due (here, in china, and elsewhere) to the desire of a government to demonstrate tech superiority, and of a company to enable that and enrich itself in the process. in the case of this particular database, gevers says that although the policy of the gdi is one of responsible disclosure, he immediately regretted his role. “personally it made angry after i found out that i unknowingly helped the company secure its oppression tool,” he told me. “this was not a happy experience.” the best we can do, and which gevers did, is to loudly proclaim how bad the idea is and how poorly it has been done, is being done and will be done."
"in today’s noisy, fast-paced world, finding a way to let clients and potential customers know that they are top of mind can be a major challenge for companies. enter sendoso, a 2.5-year-old, san francisco-based online-to-offline startup that promises to source, store and ship anything a business ever needs to send — and track its return on investment, to boot. how does it work? according to ceo and co-founder kris rudeegraap, sendoso, founded in 2016, already has 110 full-time employees, hundreds of vendor relationships and six warehouses, including its biggest, an 80,000-square-foot space in las vegas. it also has relationships with dozens of workers on whom it can call to help it as it needs them and, as crucially, it integrates with salesforce, marketo and engagio, among other platforms where companies largely live. collectively, these various pieces enable an employee to log into sendoso and — according to a budget that has been preset — click on a contact, type out a customer message and choose a gift if desired, and that directive will show up as a campaign on the company’s end and as an order over at sendoso, which then gets to work. want to send cupcakes to a client in new york? done. a handwritten note to a prospect in washington? no problem. see something on amazon? sendoso will have it sent to one of its warehouses, then repackage it so that it looks like you did it yourself. then out the door it goes with a major carrier like fedex or ups. sendoso — which charges a monthly subscription fee for its services based on a company’s number of users and its sending volume — caters to both tech startups as well as fortune 1,000 companies, with a client list that includes the marketing data company liveramp, the construction management software company procore and the call center platform talkdesk, where rudeegraap was most recently a senior account executive — and where he says the idea for sendoso was born. “having worked in sales for 10 years, it was clear that customer success was shifting away from this dependence on email because of the digital noise being created.” he sensed that a channel with offline gifts like wine and handcrafted notes (penned by sendoso warehouse workers) might be the solution. the idea of business-to-business gifting is far from new, of course, and even though sendoso is customizing the experience, it also isn’t alone, with other upstarts like knack in seattle and alyce in boston among many others focused on power gifting. still, investors like sendoso’s packaging, so to speak. indeed, rudeegraap tells us the company just closed on $10.7 million in series a funding to bolster its ranks and accelerate its reach beyond the 15 countries where the service is already available. the round was led by david sack’s craft ventures, with participation from signia partners, storm ventures, struck capital and hack vc. sendoso has now raised $13.2 million to date."
"apple is reportedly gearing up for a new streaming tv service to rival netflix, amazon and google this year, but in the meantime, it is also expanding interoperability with more third parties like smart tv makers to make what it already has available easier to use in the living room. in the latest development, smart tv maker vizio today announced at the ces consumer electronics show that it’s adding support for airplay 2 and homekit to its smartcast interactive tv platform. the integration will mean that vizio tv owners can link their other apple devices up to their tvs to browse and watch content from itunes, as well as any photos, videos or music on those devices. then, through homekit, they can also control that content and the rest of the tv using apple’s voice assistant siri. vizio said that the feature will be rolled out first to beta users of the smartcast 3.0 platform in the u.s. and canada in q1 2019. in q2, it will be rolled out to all smartcast tv users via a free, over-the-air update to the 3.0 version of the platform. “at our core, vizio is committed to delivering value. smartcast 3.0 is one of the ways we’re doing just that. by adding support for apple airplay 2 and homekit, users can play content from their iphone, ipad and mac directly to smartcast tvs, and enable tv controls through the home app and siri,” said bill baxter, chief technology officer, vizio, in a statement. he added that this also will make vizio the first smart tv brand to offer the ability for consumers to use any major voice assistant — siri, amazon’s alexa or google assistant (the latter two integrations were added previously) — to control their sets. “we’re excited to be the first in the marketplace to support such a wide range of ways for consumers to sit back and enjoy the entertainment they love.” the google assistant functionality is also expanding to control more services such as the launching of apps and switching inputs. the vizio / apple news comes just one day after vizio’s bigger rival samsung — which has a 33 percent share of the smart tv market in the us compared to vizio’s 24 percent — also debuted an apple airplay integration, along with a new tab directly linking to itunes in samsung’s interactive platform. the itunes app is an exclusive to samsung for the time being, but the vizio deal lays the groundwork for more collaboration between vizio and apple ahead. vizio, notably, is not a direct competitor to apple in other business areas in the way that samsung is. for vizio, this is a significant step ahead for the company at a time when it is playing some catchup against samsung, which once trailed vizio but gradually overtook it as the leading smart tv player. i’d argue that vizio is also still recuperating from its no-good, very bad 2017. its series of unfortunate events included a failed $2 billion acquisition of the company by chinese maker leeco after leeco itself fell apart; a lawsuit against leeco over that deal breaking down; another lawsuit, this time from the ftc (settled for $2.2 million) over snooping on its customers’ viewing habits; and a third suit brought by amd, this time over graphics patent infringement, which amd has since won. this is actually the first time that vizio has been at ces in years, which is also saying something. the company is also using the event to announce its newest range of 4k hdr smart tvs and audio equipment, including sound bars and subwoofers. on the side of apple, taken together, the two integrations with vizio and samsung underscore apple’s challenges and ambitions at the moment. the company last week warned the market that sales of its iphone smartphone — for years now the company’s undisputed growth engine — would be falling short of expectations for a number of reasons. (they included worse-than-expected sales in china, where price and feature competition is fierce; a global slowdown in phone sales as the market saturates; and weaker demand for its new, expensive models. apple, as you know, has over the years been building up a services model to complement its hardware business — with apps, music, video, cloud services and more — and many believe that the company will start to focus on that even more to offset slowdowns in its hardware sales, as well as to boost the sales of that hardware. (hence the rumors of a netflix-style ott video service.) it’s an opportunity for sure, but not a guaranteed win. apple tv — the company’s existing bridge to content on televisions — hasn’t managed to overtake the collective popularity of other smaller middleware like google’s chromecast and amazon’s fire tv and fire stick. and the ott market is very crowded already, with offerings from all of the above, pay-tv providers, smart tv makers and more. given all of the above, it will be worth watching to see who else might have apple-related news this week and if a kinder, more device-agnostic apple-as-services provider emerges as a theme at ces this week."
"media software maker plex is preparing to take on the roku channel and amazon prime video channels, possibly as soon as this year. the company is in discussions with rights holders and content providers, with a focus on bringing free, ad-supported movies to the plex platform – similar to how the roku channel got its start. it’s also talking to premium networks and content providers about offering their programming and subscriptions through plex. the talks follow the company’s recent partnership with music service tidal. by working with tidal to sell bundled subscriptions to its streaming music service along with the plex pass subscription, plex had to build certain transactional capabilities into its platform that it didn’t have before. that has paved the way for plex to expand its subscription offerings to include new partners in the future. “now we have the ability to sell other services and bundles,” noted plex co-founder and chief product officer, scott olechowski, in a discussion this week at the consumer electronics show in las vegas. “we’re bundling a plex pass with tidal. that took a little bit of backend work,” he continued. “you can imagine a bunch of different premium [content] that comes together in a single or multiple bundles, potentially.” in plex, content is organized not by source but by type – like music, movies, tv, etc. so when plex rolls out premium content and subscriptions, it would show its users what sort of movies they have access to based on their subscriptions within the app’s movies tab. the same goes for tv and so on. premium content is only one area of interest for plex going forward. it’s also looking to offer ad-supported content – like ad-supported movies. as plex expanded beyond organizing personal media collections to offer access other media – like podcasts, news, and web series, for example – it built out its ad tech platform, too. today, plex serves ads in its streaming news and web series, and is now capable of doing so for ad-supported movies. “we have the ad integration that we didn’t have before. that wasn’t there a year and a half ago,” olechowski pointed out. “i think, from a commerce perspective, we’ll have ad-supported, we’ll have free obviously, and we’ll have subscriptions. and i think we would like this year to launch transaction [capabilities] as well, just as an option for certain types of content,” he said. plex isn’t ready to launch these new offerings yet, to be clear. it needs to work on the drm portion and the transactional components for one-off purchases before it’s able to finalize deals with content providers or launch features for the plex user base. however, that could be coming as soon as this year, plex believes. “we have a bunch of conversations that make it potentially possible in 2019,” olechowski said. beyond the technical considerations, there are also larger issues plex needs to figure out before these products would launch to users – like which deals make sense for plex, how will the offerings be bundled together, how the economics will work, and more. “now, it’s really a question of what’s the right order of battle, given the conversations we’re having with content providers who are all super excited about getting content into plex,” added plex ceo keith valory. “we can’t do it all at once,” he said. while plex doesn’t have deals to announce at this time, it’s confident it will get them done. “the market is heading in this direction,” said valory. “people realize there are too many services, too many silos. there’s just too much. it’s just madness. so if there’s a way to get in front of these users – and do it in a way that they love it – they want to be part of that,” he said."
"amazon is taking on qvc with the launch of amazon live, which features live-streamed video shows from amazon talent as well as those from brands that broadcast their own live streams through a new app, amazon live creator. on the live shows, hosts talk about and demonstrate products available for sale on amazon, much like they do on qvc. beneath that sits a carousel where shoppers can browse product details and make purchases. more than one video streams on amazon live at the same time, so shoppers can tune to the one that most interests them. for example, amazon live is currently streaming a valentine’s day gift shop show, a cooking-focused show (in the kitchen with @edeneats) and back to business live, which is showing off products aimed at daycare centers and schools. you can tap on the different videos to change streams, scroll down to watch recordings of those videos that were recently live or view which live shows are coming up next. on the web, the live-streaming site is available at amazon.com/live, but it’s not listed yet in amazon’s main navigation menus so it remains hard to find. on mobile, there’s now a section labeled “amazon live” that’s appearing on both the ios and android app’s main navigation menu as of a recent app update. we’ve confirmed the page amazon.com/live is newly added, though this is not the first time amazon has offered live streams. the retailer has dabbled in live streaming in the past, with mixed results. two years ago, it pulled the plug on its short-lived effort, style code live, which also offered a qvc-like home shopping experience. the live show featured hosts with tv and broadcast backgrounds, and brought in experts to talk about beauty and style tips. but style code live focused only on fashion and beauty. amazon live, on the other hand, covers all sorts of products, ranging from smart home to games to toys to kitchen items to home goods to electronics to kitchen items and much more. it’s also positioned differently. instead of being a single live video show featuring only amazon talent and guests, live streaming is something amazon is opening up to brands that want to reach a wider audience and get their products discovered. excited to announce that i’m joining @amazon’s digital show, amazon live, as one of their newest hosts. ☺️ it’s qvc meets hsn, where all the hottest deals are discussed. my first episode airs tomorrow (tuesday) & you can watch live from 11am-1pm est: https://t.co/vvr3jccw1v 💙 pic.twitter.com/on6pz8vwef — tommy didario (@tommydidario) november 20, 2018 snuggled up with my girl @makhondlovu on set today at @amazon, talking all things rest & relaxation! grateful to work with beautiful souls like this one. 🤗 pic.twitter.com/qi2mvfb5gp — tommy didario (@tommydidario) february 6, 2019 above: amazon live hosts – according to linkedin, they are not amazon employees you may have seen some of these live-streamed videos from brands in the past. on prime day 2017 and again in 2018, amazon aired live video streams promoting some of the prime day deals. these videos were produced by the brands, very much like some you’ll now find on amazon live. the company has also aired live-streamed content on its today’s deals page, and has allowed brands to stream to their product pages, their store and on amazon.com/live before today. amazon now aims to make it easier for brands to participate on amazon live, too. on a website detailing amazon live, amazon touts how live-streaming video can drive sales, allow a brand to interact with their customers in real time — including through chat during the live stream — and reach more shoppers. one early tester, card game maker “watch ya’ mouth,” is quoted saying that live streaming had helped to increase daily visits to its product detail page by 5x and “significantly grew our sales.” the informational site also points brands to amazon’s new app for live streaming, amazon live creator. available only on ios, the app allows a brand to stream its video content directly to amazon.com on desktop, mobile and within the amazon mobile app. the app supports streaming directly from the smartphone itself or through an encoder using a professional camera. it also includes built-in analytics so brands can determine how well their stream performed, including things like how much of their budget they’ve spent on “boosting” (a way to pay to reach more shoppers), total views, unmuted views and other metrics. according to data from sensor tower, amazon live creator was released yesterday, on february 7, 2019, and is currently unranked on the app store. it has no reviews, but has a five-star rating. currently, the live-streaming feature is open to u.s. professional sellers registered in the amazon brand registry, amazon’s website says, and live streaming from china and hong kong is not supported.   amazon has been interested in live streaming for some time. the company patented its idea around live video shopping last year and was spotted hiring for its amazon live efforts before that. however, amazon had claimed at the time that its live-stream shopping experiences were “not new.” that’s true, given that live streams that would sometimes appear around big sales, like prime day, for instance. but amazon has promoted its live video directly to online shoppers since style code live. this week’s launch of the amazon live app for brands and amazon’s move to create a dedicated link to the amazon live streams on its mobile app indicates that live video is becoming a much bigger effort for the retailer, despite its attempt to shoo this away as “old news.” this increased focus on live video also comes at a time when instagram is being rumored to be working on a standalone shopping app, and is heavily pushing its creator-focused igtv product into users’ home feeds. qvc itself just announced its new identity, plans to venture deeper into e-commerce, and shoppable video app. and, of course, youtube has capitalized on how both live and pre-recorded video demos from brands and influencers can help to sell products like makeup, electronics, toys and more. amazon formally declined to comment."
"google has shared its cloud revenue exactly once over the last several years. silence tends to lead to speculation to fill the information vacuum. luckily there are some analyst firms who try to fill the void, and it looks like google’s cloud business is actually trending in the right direction, even if they aren’t willing to tell us an exact number. when google last reported its cloud revenue, last year about this time, they indicated they had earned $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, which included google cloud platform and g suite combined. diane greene, who was head of google cloud at the time, called it an “elite business.” but in reality it was pretty small potatoes compared to microsoft’s and amazon’s cloud numbers, which were pulling in $4-$5 billion a quarter between them at the time. google was looking at a $4 billion run rate for the entire year. google apparently didn’t like the reaction it got from that disclosure so it stopped talking about cloud revenue. yesterday when google’s parent company, alphabet, issued its quarterly earnings report, to nobody’s surprise, it failed to report cloud revenue yet again, at least not directly. google’s diane greene says billion-dollar cloud revenue already puts them in elite company google ceo sundar pichai gave some hints, but never revealed an exact number. instead he talked in vague terms calling google cloud “a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business.” the only time he came close to talking about actual revenue was when he said, “last year, we more than doubled both the number of google cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. we also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution, g suite.” ok, it’s not an actual dollar figure, but it’s a sense that the company is actually moving the needle in the cloud business. a bit later in the call, cfo ruth porat threw in this cloud revenue nugget. “we are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. at this point, not updating further.” she is not updating further. got it. former oracle exec thomas kurian to replace diane greene as head of google cloud that brings us to a company that guessed for us, canalys. while the firm didn’t share its methodology, it did come up with a figure of $2.2 billion for the quarter. given that the company is closing larger deals and was at a billion last year, this figure feels like it’s probably in the right ballpark, but of course it’s not from the horse’s mouth, so we can’t know for certain. it’s worth noting that canalys told techcrunch that this is for gcp revenue only, and does not include g suite, so that would suggest that it could be gaining some momentum. frankly, i’m a little baffled why alphabet’s shareholders actually let the company get away with this complete lack of transparency. it seems like people would want to know exactly what they are making on that crucial part of the business, wouldn’t you? as a cloud market watcher, i know i would, and if the company is truly beginning to pick up steam, as canalys data suggests, the lack of openness is even more surprising. maybe next quarter. google in the cloud"

"it’s time for another hit off the juice box. netflix announced today that it will release the remaining eight episodes of “arrested development’s” fifth season on march 5, 10 months after the first half premiered. in the intervening time, however, the show has dealt with several controversies revolving around accusations of abusive behavior from star jeffrey tambor, who plays family patriarch george bluth. you can’t handle the bluth. arrested development returns march 15 pic.twitter.com/07ua4hjlgb — arrested development (@arresteddev) february 19, 2019 the netflix installments of the show, which began in 2013 with season 4 and marked the show’s return after running from 2003 to 2006 on fox, have received mixed reviews and failed to achieve the iconic status of the original episodes. the controversies surrounding the show’s cast has also dampened some fans’ enthusiasm, at least for the new seasons. tambor will appear in the upcoming episodes despite being fired from amazon studios’ “transparent” last year after he was accused of sexual harassment by two of his colleagues on the series. then tambor’s “arrested development” co-star jessica walter said he had verbally abused her during filming. in a new york times cast interview to promote the first half of season five, walter said she was “over it now,” but tone-deaf responses from male castmates, including jason bateman, underscored how warped gender dynamics and tambor’s misbehavior might have been enabled on set (bateman later apologized). tambor has denied the sexual harassment accusations, but a year and a half after the metoo movement began taking off, it is likely to continue casting a pall over the latest installment of “arrested development.” the new season picks up story lines involving the bluth company’s involvement in building the border wall and buster’s murder trial."
"instacart has expanded its alcohol delivery to now be available in 14 states and washington, dc from nearly 100 different retailers. with the roll-out, instacart alcohol delivery is currently available to 40 million homes in the u.s., and the number of alcohol deliveries on the platform has more than doubled since the same time last year. partners who participate in alcohol delivery on instacart include albertsons, kroger, publix, schnucks and stater bros., alongside wine and liquor stores such as bevmo!, binny’s beverage depot and total wine & more. the list of states where instacart offers alcohol delivery include california, connecticut, florida, illinois, kentucky, massachusetts, minnesota, missouri, north carolina, ohio, oregon, texas, virginia, washington and washington, dc. instacart started rolling out alcohol delivery a year ago, and has quickly become a competitive player in the space. postmates introduced alcohol delivery in 2017, whereas strictly alcohol delivery services like drizly, minibar and saucey have been around for a while. here is what instacart’s chief business officer, nilam ganenthiran, had to say: part of grocery shopping for many people goes beyond getting fresh produce, meats and pantry staples, and includes picking up the perfect bottle of wine for a dinner party or their favorite beer to sip while watching the big game. by working alongside our retail partners to add alcohol to the marketplace, we’re offering customers more choice and making it easier for instacart to be their ‘one-stop-shop’ to get the groceries they need – including beer, wine and spirits – from the retailers they love. when amazon bought whole foods in 2017, some speculated that instacart might be hit hard. but the deal also represented the digitization of a massive, traditional industry. considering instacart’s retail partner growth over the past year, it seems that the whole foods acquisition might have made instacart an attractive platform for some retailers. the company now serves more than 80 percent of u.s. households, which was instacart’s stated goal for the end of 2018. across its 300 retail partners, instacart now delivers from 20,000 grocery stores across 5,500 cities in north america."
"venture capitalists’ latest on-demand delivery bet is in the pharmaceutical space. truepill, an online pharmacy powering delivery for the likes of hims, nurx, lemonaid and other direct-to-consumer healthcare brands, has nabbed a $10 million series a from early-stage vc fund initialized capital. the investment brings the y combinator graduate’s total raised to $13.4 million. y combinator, sound ventures, tuesday capital and others participated in the round. founded in 2016, the san mateo-based startup employs 150 workers and plans to expand its team and fulfillment facilities into the u.k. with the fresh funding. truepill is currently active in all 50 states and has delivered 1 million subscriptions for birth control, erectile dysfunction medication, hair loss treatment and more. it is, as co-founders sid viswanathan and umar afridi explained, amazon web services for pharmacies. “we are really only scratching the surface of where this telemedicine landscape is going to go,” viswanathan, who became a product manager at linkedin after the social network acquired his transcription service cardmunch, told techcrunch. “we are catering to this first wave of those companies and we want to be that pharmacy fulfillment service powering that entire shift … we want to build the next generation of pharmacy infrastructure.” afridi, for his part, previously spent more than a decade as a pharmacist at retail chains like cvs and fred meyer. in addition to operating a prescription delivery service, truepill provides a set of apis that give its customers programmatic access to its pharmacy and allows brands to fully customize packaging. foundation capital, index ventures, social capital, box group and joe montana are also truepill stakeholders. wellness startup hims enters the unicorn club with $100m investment"
"to compete in a world of on-demand everything right to your door led by the likes of amazon and uber, traditional physical retailers and those working with them have been looking for an edge by providing efficient, tech-fuelled delivery services of their own. now, a startup that has built a platform to enable last-mile logistics and other delivery features for these businesses has announced a round of funding to fuel its growth. bringg, which works with the likes of walmart and mcdonalds, as well third-party delivery businesses like doordash, to optimise and manage logistics and other aspects of the delivery process, has raised $25 million to expand its business. a typical example of what bringg provides to its retail customers is the spark delivery operation that walmart launched late last year: it gives the company the ability to optimize driver schedules, automatically dispatch orders, allow drivers to communicate their availability and in turn communicate to drivers by way of smart alerts to make sure deliveries are picked up, queued and delivered on time.  other services that bringg can offer to customers include helping them run click-and-collect schemes, manage “crowdsourced” fleets, and returns. amazon has set the bar high when it comes to setting customer expectations by providing a service that can deliver anything you want in a faster time than it would take for you to go out and buy it. across various markets it sells food, or clothing, books, streamed films and thousands of other products this way, by way of its prime subscription service. a number of startups have emerged to help businesses that are not amazon and uber better compete against them and that proposition. they include companies like fivestars to help build loyalty programs; deliverr (yes, it has chosen to follow the same naming convention…) to help with fulfilment and distribution; ordergroove to build tools to encourage repeat buying; deliv to provide businesses with a network of people to run same-day deliveries; and tookan, which directly competes with bringg for delivery logistics management. and there are more in existence and likely coming down the pike, since every company both worries on amazon encroaching on their business, but also, more simply, will try to provide what their customers want. the reason investors are interested specifically in bringg — which is co-headquartered in chicago and tel aviv — is in part because of its extensive customer list but also because of its focus on the lucrative market of logistics, which is widely credited as at the core of why amazon does so well. (economies of scale is another, which is where being a big retailer like walmart or mcdonalds, or an aggregating platform like doordash, comes in.) “bringg [is] a pioneering company that’s providing crucial capabilities to leading organizations looking to connect logistics data across different silos and optimize their last mile of delivery,” said matthew cowan, partner at next47, in a statement. “with the global logistics market predicted to grow to $15.5 trillion by 2023 and the ‘amazon effect’ drastically changing customer expectations, bringg has a massive opportunity to fundamentally transform the logistics industry by enabling seamless automation, greater data transparency, and a more collaborative mental outlook.” amazon has created a logistics powerhouse to run its delivery service, and the idea is that now other retailers can, using bringg, have the same kind of tools at their disposal, letting them not just manage the logistics for a delivery service, but help companies track and manage goods and drivers, and specifically to do so even when they are not providing the delivery services themselves. this is key: many companies will never want to build and operate their own fleet of delivery people and vehicles to bring things to customers; but they will instead work with the likes of doordash or deliv or postmates to do this. (even amazon doesn’t deliver all of amazon’s packages, but it still handles the logistics.) this will help those people also continue to manage their products and delivery within that third-party service. “this new investment enables bringg to level the playing field in the age of amazon by enabling large retailers, grocery chains, consumer goods companies, restaurant chains and logistics firms to provide their customers with what they expect from their deliveries, based on the optimized business models required to win in today’s challenging market,” said guy bloch, ceo at bringg, in a statement. “we are on a mission to equip enterprises with the technology platform they need to orchestrate successful delivery operations, providing their management and logistics teams with the visibility and control they need to not only survive but thrive in this exciting new landscape.” bringg is already active in 50 markets and the plan will be to take that to more with this series c, which comes from siemens’ vc next47, salesforce ventures, aleph vc, og ventures, cambridge capital, coca-cola, ituran and pereg ventures. bringg is not disclosing its valuation with this round although we are trying to find out. it’s raised $53 million to date."
"now that amazon has said that it’s taking its ball and going home rather than deal with mean, pushy new yorkers, outside observers are giving off the sense that the city (and its local politicians) are losing out for their recalcitrance. they’re wrong. new york city is running at about a 4.3 percent unemployment rate — higher than the national average of 3.9 percent, but a respectable number for jobs. amazon’s promise of 25,000 jobs (high-paying jobs) may have reduced that number, but there’s no guarantee that those jobs would be filled by new yorkers or queens residents more specifically — and every indication that they would have gone to amazon employees coming from somewhere else. remember, amazon employees were buying real estate in queens before the deal was even announced. the response that new yorkers are idiots for not giving amazon (one of the most valuable companies in the world) billions in tax incentives to build an office tower in one of its boroughs is another sign of how the country privileges business interests above civic ones. “new york city is such a valuable and desirable place to do business that literally no company on earth can resist coming here which is why we were forced to bribe amazon” is a curious argument for the governor to keep making — tc (@chillmage) february 14, 2019 there are things that new york can do to boost its local economy without giving away the store to amazon. there are incentives that could go to businesses already in new york to establish offices in queens. more importantly, local queens residents had legitimate concerns about how their neighborhood would be transformed by amazon’s entrance into the borough. that’s not to say that local politicians may not have overplayed their hand. new york local politics is no stranger to graft, corruption, shakedowns or funny business (i wasn’t in the room for the negotiations), but it’s safe to say that “mistakes were made” on both sides. in the long run, amazon would have been a benefit to the new york economy — and had the company’s executives made a good-faith effort to listen to the concerns of local residents, perhaps it could have come out looking like a winner. because there are legitimate reasons to expect amazon to be a benefit to the new york economy. as noah smith wrote in bloomberg after the deal was announced: amazon will pay property tax on its new long island city offices. it will pay corporate tax — not just on its profits, but on its capital base. its employees, especially highly paid ones, will pay the city’s personal income tax. those taxes, of course, will be somewhat offset by the incentives that the city has promised the company — up to $2 billion, depending on how many people the company hires and how many facilities it builds. those incentives were a wasteful way to attract corporate investment. but in the long run, the tax revenue new york city gets from hq2 will probably far exceed the cost. and that’s not even taking into account amazon’s effect on surrounding businesses and property values. other technology companies will want to move to queens now that amazon is there. their employees will spend their money locally, buying everything from lattes to mris. some estimates place hq2’s local economic boost at $17 billion a year. even dividing that in half, and even assuming that the estimate is optimistic by a factor of 2 or 3, it seems likely that the economic benefit queens reaps from hq2 will quickly exceed the upfront cost — unlike, say, wisconsin’s ill-advised foxconn factory. those benefits are true, but harder to quantify for a city like new york when taken against the impact those jobs and spending would have on the fabric of the local economy and the housing, transit and government services that new residents would demand. the livability crisis that’s currently afflicting seattle and san francisco is evidence of how cities need to be careful what they wish for when it comes to the explosive growth of technology companies (and the attendant wealth that comes with it) in their metropolises. in any event, the urban landscape of the u.s. is being radically reshaped by technology companies — creating cities that are haves and have-nots much as technology has bifurcated the national economy into digital haves and have nots. as mark muro and robert maxim of the brookings institute noted in this piece for us news and world report: scholars have for years suspected that tech might alter the hierarchy of cities, given its bias toward skilled workers. more than a decade ago, researchers paul beaudry, mark doms and ethan g. lewis showed cities that adopted personal computers earliest and fastest saw their relative wages increase the quickest. now, there is more evidence – including in our own work – that digital technologies are contributing heavily to the divergence of metro economies and the pull away of superstar cities like boston and san francisco from more ordinary ones, with painful impacts. recently, princeton economist elisa giannone demonstrated that the divergence of cities’ wages since 1980 – after decades of convergence – reflects a mix of technology’s increased rewards to highly skilled tech workers and tech-driven industry clustering. likewise, brookings research has shown that a short list of highly digital, often coastal tech hubs is growing even more digital and pulling farther away from the pack on measures of growth and income. what we call the “digitization of everything” is in this way exacerbating the unevenness of america’s economic landscape. it’s far easier to make the case that amazon’s decision to set up regional offices in nashville will have far more positive outcomes for that city. but making american cities compete beauty pageant-style and bend over backwards to appease a multi-billion-dollar corporation is pretty gross — and a poor read of national sentiment around the roles that technology companies play in modern american society. as an example of how to expand in a city without invoking the wrath of the local community, observers need only look at how google is expanding in new york. the company is planning to add 14,000 jobs in the city and has committed to $1 billion in spending to upgrade its west side campuses. ostensibly, google is expanding its presence in new york to compete for the talent it sees coming from the city (or coming to the city) and because new york is strategically important. amazon’s decision to forsake new york means that it’s losing access to that talent and creating opportunities for other tech companies to come in and take its place — or for local companies to retain their edge. here’s hoping that new york’s local tech community can supply queens with those 25,000 jobs by building the next amazon — and working with the community to do it. these days it seems like democracy is a religion that’s replaced god with money. the pushback against amazon shows that new york at least is adding civic responsibility into that equation somewhere."
"recently in a conversation, the length of term sheets came as a topic (i assure you, it was a riveting conversation). the complaint was that a term sheet which had recently been received was too long, and therefore the vc who sent it wasn’t being founder friendly. the travails of successfully raising money! actually though, a longer term sheet is much more founder friendly and good business practice, and founders should be leery of vcs bearing short contracts. historically (i.e. about 6 years ago), term sheets used to be staid affairs, printed on plain white paper in standard times new roman font right out of word. it was a wretched and horrifying world until the cool vcs showed up, who added design accoutrements (bolded section heads! logos! colors!) while claiming that they had a “single-page” term sheet for founders, implying that the term sheet’s simplicity and prettiness showed that they weren’t really investors, but more like a brooklyn barista with an art side hustle (and a lot of cash). you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. here’s the thing, term sheets have an incredibly important purpose, which is to set forth in clear language the terms of a deal. unfortunately in modern venture capital, there are a lot of terms that have to be negotiated in any equity round, from financial terms to option pools, to board structure, to voting rights on major business decisions like selling the company, and much more. simpler term sheets either relegate many of these items to “standard venture capital terms apply” or some other vague language, or just wholly don’t mention them at all. the challenge is that once the term sheet is signed, it becomes the blueprint by which the legal counsels for the vc and founder begin to write up the legal contracts that allows the vc to buy equity in the startup. when term sheets are clear, precise, and comprehensive, the lawyers just go to work and turn those agreed-upon terms into legal language in relatively short order. when there are key terms that are “standard” or absent from a term sheet though, lawyers do what lawyers have to do: they negotiate for their respective party. suddenly a term that seems fairly standard is up for debate, and unless a founder (and their vc) is paying very close attention to the legal process (from experience, no one really is), then the legal bills for the round can spiral very, very rapidly. that can pose a double whammy for a startup, since many vcs continue to charge the legal fees of conducting a round to the startup they are investing in. i’ve seen founders in absolute sticker shock after seeing the legal costs of their round total into the upper tens of thousands of dollars because their lawyers racked up time trying to plow through term after term that could have been made clearer by the parties up front. so, what’s more founder friendly: a longer term sheet that sets the deal terms clearly up front and likely saves the founder legal costs, or a shorter (but color!) term sheet that can end up costing far more down the line? this is mostly a problem for first-time founders raising their first round of capital. i have a sinking feeling that many vcs take advantage of this naiveté to get better terms than they might have gotten otherwise had they actually walked through all the language up front. in later rounds, founders either ask all the right questions about the next round of capital, or their other existing investors figure this out on their behalf. it’s good legal practice to always get all material terms figured out before your lawyers start writing contracts, whether in fundraising, or customer contracts, or what have you. you can’t always predict if there is something else that will end up being a disagreement, but getting most of the terms squared away will save legal time, and that is money ultimately in your pocket. side note: extra crunch published part two of five of our comprehensive guide to legal issues facing startups, this time focused on intellectual property. don’t miss out on part one which focused on corporate issues. extra crunch’s first conference call is today we are hosting the first conference call for extra crunch subscribers today at 2pm est / 11am pst. call-in details are being sent out to members by email roughly one hour in advance. today, eric eldon and i will talk briefly about extra crunch, and then techcrunch social and product maestro josh constine is going to talk about the strategic issues confronting the social giants. join us! more softbank vision fund sadness kiyoshi ota/bloomberg via getty images written by arman tabatabai get out your popcorn because there’s more drama involving softbank’s giant vision fund and its lp base. bahrain’s sovereign wealth fund stated that it no longer planned to invest in the vision fund. despite previous discussions with softbank, the fund plans to instead put its money into infrastructure across areas like energy, healthcare, and education. with assets of roughly $15 billion under management, bahrain’s fund is small potatoes when it comes to softbank, and its contribution likely would have been much smaller than those of its abu dhabi and saudi arabia counterparts. however, after recent reports that persian gulf lps are growing frustrated with the vision fund and are putting more money to work in infrastructure, bahrain’s decision could indicate a broader change in sentiment towards the vision fund. just look at the comment the ceo of bahrain’s fund gave to reuters: “we talked with them and with many people, but it shows we’ve not seen something we think we can add value to or it could add value to us.” softbank ceo masayoshi son has wanted to scale up the size of vision fund ii, but that dream may well be fading as more large wealth managers decline to engage. steam and video game streaming photo by andy cross/the denver post via getty images extra crunch writer chris morris had a dive into the challenges facing steam yesterday. steam is facing two trends. first, publishers are increasingly getting smart about owning their customer relationship, which is hard to do with the design of steam’s platform. the second is that video game streaming is getting closer to reality, and that doesn’t bode well for a game store. plus, developers want to keep more of their revenue, and steam takes a lot. what’s interesting here is that publishers (and i mean big, aaa publishers) are increasingly comfortable with the notion that they can attract customers to their own independent store fronts and don’t have to pay the steam tax in order to get in front of customers. what concerns me is that indie developers both don’t have the leverage to negotiate with steam and don’t have the marketing budgets or fanbases to reach out to a wide audience. that’s not a great world, and an opportunity i think to figure out how to create a more even playing field for independent game creators. the chip space keeps getting hotter as korea’s sk leads round for chinese chipmaker ivancovlad via getty images written by arman tabatabai techcrunch writer rita liao reported overnight that the a.i.-focused chinese chipmaker horizon robotics raised a $600 million round led by subsidiaries of korea’s sk group, including its semiconductors segment. we’ve previously discussed the intensifying global competition in the chip space, and sk’s investment shows that no one wants to miss out on the next innovative technology like previous incumbents who now find themselves playing catch up. it’s worth noting that intel’s venture arm, intel capital, is also an investor in horizon and led their previous fundraise, as horizon seems to offer up another opportunity for the us chip giant to make up lost ground in ai chip innovation and to gain share in the chinese market now that they have canceled a partnership with china’s state-backed chipmaker unisoc. the data point is another positive for chinese chipmakers, who seem to still have access to foreign capital on top of more than enough domestic — often state-backed — investments. the city of beijing just raised its first venture fund with $1.5 billion focused on chips, a.i., and other areas, while china is reportedly nearing the closing of its second state-backed semis fund that some estimate might be nearly $50 billion in size. more news written by arman tabatabai california may have canceled hsr, but china is moving forward with an ipo while us high-speed rail (hsr) projects continue to fall flat on their face, china railway corporation is now planning to ipo its beijing to shanghai hsr line within the next year. there’s always some financial risk with publicly-traded infrastructure, but the line’s securely profitable and the deal should help shore up the finances of its owner as it plans to make its largest rail investments ever this year. japan’s antitrust investigation is the latest in asia’s new wave of regulatory scrutiny japan is reportedly initiating an antitrust investigation into the country’s biggest ecommerce platforms. investigators will be looking to see whether amazon japan, rakuten and softbank-subsidiary yahoo! japan launched benefit programs that ultimately are subsidized by and cut into the revenue of its small-to-midsize vendor suppliers. the investigation is the latest in japan’s broader effort to increase regulatory scrutiny on big tech, a global trend that seems to be permeating asia as seen in our previous discussions on india. while it’s unclear how the heightened scrutiny will impact companies’ perception of these markets, it’s certainly clear that the “move fast and break things” playbook is getting tougher to run. obsessions we have a bit of a theme around emerging markets, macroeconomics, and the next set of users to join the internet. more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure, and “why can’t we build things” thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people, and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates."
"when the government comes for your data, tech companies can’t always tell you. but thanks to a legal loophole, companies can say if they haven’t had a visit yet. that’s opened up an interesting clause that allows companies to silently warn customers when the government turns up to secretly raid its stash of customer data without violating a gag order it. under u.s. freedom of speech laws, companies can publicly say that “the government has not been here” when there has been no demand for data, but they are allowed to remove statements when a warrant comes in as a warning shot to anyone who pays attention. these so-called “warrant canaries” — named for the poor canary down the mine that dies when there’s gas that humans can’t detect — are a key transparency tool that predominantly privacy-focused companies use to keep their customers aware of the goings-on behind the scenes. where companies have abandoned their canaries or caved to legal pressure, cloudflare is bucking the trend. the networking and content delivery network giant said in a blog post this week that it’s expanding the transparency reports to include more canaries. to date, the company: has never turned over their ssl keys or customers’ ssl keys to anyone; has never installed any law enforcement software or equipment anywhere on their network; has never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure; has never provided any law enforcement organization a feed of customers’ content transiting their network. those key points are critical to the company’s business. a government demand for ssl keys and installing intercept equipment on its network would allow investigators unprecedented access to a customer’s communications and data, and undermine the company’s security. a similar demand led to ladar levison shutting down his email service lavabit when they sought the keys to obtain information on whistleblower edward snowden, who used the service. now cloudflare’s warrant canaries will include: cloudflare has never modified customer content at the request of law enforcement or another third party. cloudflare has never modified the intended destination of dns responses at the request of law enforcement or another third party. cloudflare has never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of its encryption at the request of law enforcement or another third party. it has also expanded and replaced its first canary to confirm that the company “has never turned over our encryption or authentication keys or our customers’ encryption or authentication keys to anyone.” cloudflare said that if it were ever asked to do any of the above, the company would “exhaust all legal remedies” to protect customer data, and remove the statements from its site. the networking and content delivery network is one of a handful of major companies that have used warrant canaries over the years. following reports that the national security agency was vacuuming up the call records from the major telecom giants in bulk, apple included a statement in its most recent transparency reports noting that the company has to date “not received any orders for bulk data.” reddit removed its warrant canary in 2015, indicating that it had received a national security order it wasn’t permitted to disclose. cloudflare’s expanded canaries were included in the company’s latest transparency report, out this week. according to its latest figures covering the second half of 2018, cloudflare responded to just seven subpoenas of the 19 requests, affecting 12 accounts and 309 domains. the company also responded to 44 court orders of the 55 requests, affecting 134 accounts and 19,265 domains. the company received between 0-249 national security requests for the duration, and didn’t process any wiretap or foreign government requests for the duration. amazon’s barely-transparent transparency report somehow gets more opaque"
"google is a tech powerhouse in many categories, including advertising. today, as part of its efforts to improve how that ad business works, it provided an annual update that details the progress it’s made to shut down some of the more nefarious aspects of it. using both manual reviews and machine learning, in 2018, google said removed 2.3 billion “bad ads” that violated its policies, which at their most general forbid ads that mislead or exploit vulnerable people. along with that, google has been tackling the other side of the “bad ads” conundrum: pinpointing and shutting down sites that violate policies and also profit from using its ad network: google said it removed ads from 1.5 million apps and nearly 28 million pages that violated publisher policies. on the more proactive side, the company also said today that it is introducing a new ad policy manager in april to give tips to those creating and posting ads to avoid listing non-compliant ads in the first place. google’s ad machine makes billions for the company — more than $32 billion in the previous quarter, accounting for 83 percent of all google’s revenues. those revenues underpin a variety of wildly popular, free services such as gmail, youtube, android and of course its search engine — but there is undoubtedly a dark side, too: bad ads that slip past the algorithms and mislead or exploit vulnerable people, and sites that exploit google’s ad network by using it to fund the spread of misleading information, or worse. notably, google’s 2.3 billion figure is nearly 1 billion less ads than it removed last year for policy violations. while google has continued to improve its ability to track and stop these ads before they make their way to its network, google said in a response to tc that the lower number was actually because it has shifted its focus to removing bad accounts rather than individual bad ads — the idea being that one can be responsible for multiple bad ads. indeed, the number of bad accounts that got removed in 2018, nearly 1 million, was double the figure in 2017, and that would mean the bad ads are not hitting the network in the first place. “by removing one bad account, we’re blocking someone who could potentially run thousands of bad ads,” a company spokesperson said. “this helps to address the root cause of bad ads and allows us to better protect our users.” meanwhile, while the ad business continues to grow, that growth has been slowing just a little in competition with other players like facebook and amazon. the more cynical question one might ask here is whether google removed less ads to improve its bottom line. but in reality, remaining vigilant about all the bad stuff is more than just google doing the right thing. it’s been shown that some advertisers will walk away rather than be associated with nefarious or misleading content. recent youtube ad pulls by huge brands like at&t, nestle and epic games — after it was found that pedophiles have been lurking in the comments of youtube videos — shows that there are still more frontiers that google will need to tackle in the future to keep its house — and business — in order. for now, it’s focusing on ads, apps, website pages, and those who run them all. on the advertising front, google’s director of sustainable ads, scott spencer, highlighted ads removed from several specific categories this year: there were nearly 207,000 ads for ticket resellers, 531,000 ads for bail bonds and 58.8 million phishing ads taken out of the network. part of this was based on the company identifying and going after some of these areas, either on its own steam or because of public pressure. in one case, for ads for drug rehab clinics, the company removed all ads for these after an expose, before reintroducing them again a year later. some 31 new policies were added in the last year to cover more categories of suspicious ads, spencer said. one of these included cryptocurrencies: it will be interesting to see how and if this one becomes a more prominent part of the mix in the years ahead.  because ads are like the proverbial trees falling in the forest — you have to be there to hear the sound — google is also continuing its efforts to identify bad apps and sites that are hosting ads from its network (both the good and bad). on the website front, it created 330 new “detection classifiers” to seek out specific pages that are violating policies. the company has made other changes to how ads on pages work directed at page publishers, such as the introduction of page-level “auto-ads” last year. this is not related to the 330 detection classifiers, but more generally shows improvements that it’s making on how it can help and better control how things function on a page level. the efforts to use this to identify “badness” at page level led google to shut down 734,000 publishers and app developers, removing ads from 1.5 million apps and 28 million pages that violated policies. fake news also continues to get a name check in google’s efforts. the focus for both google and facebook in the last year has been around how its networks are used to manipulate democratic processes. no surprise there: this is an area where they have been heavily scrutinised by governments. the risk is that, if they do not demonstrate that they are not lazily allowing dodgy political ads on their network — because after all those ads do still represent ad revenues — they might find themselves in regulatory hot water, with more policies being enforced from the outside to curb their operations. this past year, google said that it verified 143,000 election ads in the us — it didn’t note how many it banned — and started to provide new data to people about who is really behind these ads. the same will be launched in the eu and india this year ahead of elections in those regions. the new policies it’s introducing to improve the range of sites it indexes and helps people find are also taking shape. some 1.2 million pages, 22,000 apps and 15,000 sites were removed from its ad network for violating policies around misrepresentative, hateful or other low-quality content. these included 74,000 pages and 190,000 ads that violated its “dangerous or derogatory” content policy. looking ahead, the new dashboard that google announced it would be launching next month is a self-help tool for advertisers: using machine learning, google will scan ads before they are uploaded to the network to determine whether they violate any policies. at launch, it will look at ads, keywords and extensions across an advertiser’s account (not just the ad itself). over time, google said, it will also give tips to the advertisers in real time to help fix them if there are problems, along with a history of appeals and certifications. this sounds like a great idea for advertisers who are not in the market for peddling iffy content: more communication and quick responses are what they want so that if they do have issues, they can fix them and get the ads out the door. (and that, of course, will also help google by ushering in more inventory, faster and with less human involvement.) more worrying, in my opinion, is how this might get misused by bad actors. as malicious hacking has shown us, creating screens sometimes also creates a way for malicious people to figure out loopholes for bypassing them."
"joel wallenstrom contributor joel wallenstrom is president and chief executive of wickr, a secure communications company. before wickr, joel co-founded isec partners, one of the world's leading information security research teams, later acquired by ncc group, and served as director for strategic alliances at @stake, one of the very first computer security companies in the industry. more posts by this contributor exposure of your sensitive data isn’t a bug, it’s a feature taking the bite out of the non-malware threat the “below the belt selfie” media circus surrounding jeff bezos has made encrypted communications top of mind among nervous executive handlers. their assumption is that a product with serious cryptography like wickr — where i work — or signal could have helped help mr. bezos and amazon avoid this drama. it’s a good assumption, but a troubling conclusion. i worry that moments like these will drag serious cryptography down to the level of the national enquirer. i’m concerned that this media cycle may lead people to view privacy and cryptography as a safety net for billionaires rather than a transformative solution for data minimization and privacy. we live in the chapter of computing when data is mostly unprotected because of corporate indifference. the leaders of our new economy — like the vast majority of society — value convenience and short-term gratification over the security and privacy of consumer, employee and corporate data.   we cannot let this media cycle pass without recognizing that when corporate executives take a laissez-faire approach to digital privacy, their employees and organizations will follow suit. two recent examples illustrate the privacy indifference of our leaders: the most powerful executive in the world is either indifferent to, or unaware that, unencrypted online flirtations would be accessed by nation states and competitors. 2016 presidential campaigns were either indifferent to, or unaware that unencrypted online communications detailing “off-the-record” correspondence with media and payments to adult actor(s) would be accessed by nation states and competitors. if our leaders do not respect and understand online security and privacy, then their organizations will not make data protection a priority. it’s no surprise that we see a constant stream of large corporations and federal agencies breached by nation states and competitors. who then can we look to for leadership? gdpr is an early attempt by regulators to lead. the european union enacted gdpr to ensure individuals own their data and enforce penalties on companies who do not protect personal data. it applies to all data processors, but the eu is clearly focused on sending a message to the large u.s. based data processors — amazon, facebook, google, microsoft, etc. in january, france’s national data protection commission sent a message by fining google $57 million for breaching gdpr rules. it was an unprecedented fine that garnered international attention. however, we must remember that in 2018 google’s revenues were greater than $300 million … per day! gdpr is, at best, an annoying speed-bump in the monetization strategy of large data processors. jeff bezos accuses national enquirer of blackmailing him — and publishes the details himself it is through this lens that senator ron wyden’s (oregon) idealistic call for billions of dollars in corporate fines and jail time for executives who enable privacy breaches can be seen as reasonable. when record financial penalties are inconsequential it is logical to pursue other avenues to protect our data. real change will come when our leaders understand that data privacy and security can increase profitability and reliability. for example, the compliance, governance and oversight council reports that an enterprise will spend as much as $50 million to protect 10 petabytes of data, and that $34.5 million of this is spent on protecting data that should be deleted. serious efficiencies are waiting to be realized and serious cryptography can help.   so, thank you mr. bezos for igniting corporate interest in secure communications. let’s hope this news cycle convinces our corporate leaders and elected officials to embrace data privacy, protection and minimization because it responsible, profitable and efficient. we need leaders and elected officials to set an example and respect their own data and privacy if we have any hope of their organizations to protect ours."
"last year’s versa was at the center of fitbit’s reversing fortunes. after two years in the wilderness, the smartwatch helped turn the tide for the flailing company. last quarter marked the first time in two years the company saw a year-over-year increase in devices shipped. after the lackluster launch of the ionic, the versa delivered, with a sleeker and smaller form factor, a more mature ecosystem and, perhaps most importantly of all, a lower price point. that device launched at $200 — $100 cheaper than the ionic. the company is further leveraging those lessons learned for the versa lite edition. it’s pretty much what it sounds like: a stripped-down version of the versa, which arrives at $160. the arrival of the original versa helped fitbit grow its smartwatch business 442 percent, year-over-year, ceo james park told techcrunch in a recent interview. the category now comprises 44 percent of the company’s business and has helped catapult fitbit to the no. 2 smartwatch spot in the u.s. behind you-know-who. “there are more and more people getting interested in the smartwatch category, but there are certain barriers to them jumping in: ease of use, simplicity and pricing,” park said.  a further price drop could help push fitbit’s gains even more among those who have been eyeing the category but don’t want to pay the full $200. positioned against other top smartwatch models, the price point is certainly appealing. of course, it does come with some compromises. the lite drops a number of features for the sake of lowering the product’s price point. it’s a combination of some core smartwatch capabilities and some fitbit excess. the list includes floors climbed, swim laps, music, fitbit’s on-screen workouts, additional band styles and fitbit pay. if none of those sounds particularly essential to your smartwatch needs, then the versa might be the device for you. the product looks nearly identical to its predecessor in both size and shape, though the company has pared the original versa’s three buttons down to one.the relative success of the device will provide an interesting proving ground for fitbit’s smartwatch sales — and help determine precisely what people are looking for in the category. the versa was a solid device — and certainly an improvement over the ionic, in spite of dropping a handful of features. pre-orders open today. they’ll be available from retailers including amazon, best buy, kohl’s, target and walmart later this month. the versa and ionic, in the meantime, aren’t going anywhere any time soon. “we feel that there’s a distinct need for a higher-end asp (average selling price),” park explains. “we do consider that an important part of our portfolio.”"
"in a surprise turn, amazon has announced that it’s pulling out on plans to open one of two hq2 locations in new york city. the move follows much criticism from local government and citizens, who have pushed back on the company’s proposed long island city location, citing tax breaks and amazon’s longstanding anti-unionization policies. amazon has offered a lengthy statement to techcrunch, which also notes that it has no plans to re-open its search for a new location, instead sticking with already announced plans for northern virginia and nashville. here’s the statement in full: after much thought and deliberation, we’ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for amazon in long island city, queens. for amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. while polls show that 70% of new yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in long island city. we are disappointed to have reached this conclusion — we love new york, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture — and particularly the community of long island city, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small business owners, and residents. there are currently over 5,000 amazon employees in brooklyn, manhattan, and staten island, and we plan to continue growing these teams. we are deeply grateful to governor cuomo, mayor de blasio, and their staffs, who so enthusiastically and graciously invited us to build in new york city and supported us during the process. governor cuomo and mayor de blasio have worked tirelessly on behalf of new yorkers to encourage local investment and job creation, and we can’t speak positively enough about all their efforts. the steadfast commitment and dedication that these leaders have demonstrated to the communities they represent inspired us from the very beginning and is one of the big reasons our decision was so difficult. unlike the other announced locations, amazon’s plans for a queens location have been the subject of criticism since day one, owing in part to deals that were brokered behind closed doors with mayor bill de blasio. the city’s already shaky infrastructure and strained housing also came under scrutiny, as did the location of the proposed build, which had already been set aside for schools, affordable housing and parks, along with smaller commercial space.  amazon reps were grilled in multiple city council meetings, and met with statements like, “new york is a union town,” by council members. last week, the company was reported to be rethinking the move, but shook off the suggestion, telling techcrunch, “we’re focused on engaging with our new neighbors – small business owners, educators, and community leaders. whether it’s building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of new york city students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be.” a mere two days ago, de blasio called the plan “mission critical.” for now, however, that mission appears to have failed. “i look forward to working with companies that understand that if you’re willing to engage with new yorkers and work through challenging issues new york city is the world’s best place to do business,” city council speaker corey johnson said in a statement offered to techcrunch. “i hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent. i know i’d choose mass transit over helipads any day.”"
"ben schippers contributor ben schippers is a co-founder of happyfuncorp. more posts by this contributor a modest proposal to make apps suck less tesla, a great family brand as the landscape for designing and building technology continues to evolve, so should the process for designing such systems. whether it’s for investing or helping to build a product, it’s important to convey a need for the entrepreneur or company to consider the long term impact of their product and to consider a more mindful and deliberate approach. product processes should always go in this order: strategy first, then design and lastly, engineering.  if you approach each process pillar with “why?” you will end up with a better product, a more engaged consumer and maybe even a valuable contribution to our ever bloated internet. phase 1, product strategy: within the product strategy pillar, it’s important to remember that just because someone can build a product, doesn’t mean they should.  just because a type of technology is available, doesn’t mean it will improve an experience.  purpose drives products, never technology for its own sake. recently at the 40th international conference of data protection, giovanni buttarelli, the conference host stated, “not everything that is legally compliant and technically feasible is morally sustainable.”  in other words, “should i build it?” is a question to always be asked during this phase. a clue to truly understanding this phase is to ask “how different is my idea before starting this phase vs. after?” the more an idea has evolved, the better. phase 2, product design: if designers keep bouncing between phase 1 and 2, that’s a good sign.  remember, ideas that die in phase 1 should be viewed as wins no matter how much work or time has been put in. while transitioning to the product design phase, it’s critical to remember: the consumer is tired … really tired. assume that most conventions simply don’t resonate with the consumer anymore; consider it a widespread technology burnout — app fatigue.  a perfect example of this is with notifications or similar mindless alerts. do notifications make the experience better?  do notifications make users want to use the software or the app?  if it’s a question that’s being asked, then the answer is a resounding, no.  go back to the strategy phase – rinse and repeat. the questions to ask are quite simply, “what will make a user want to come back to this product without notifications or similar tchotchkes?” what experience is created that’s going to resonate with the customer? if an overall user experience resonates with the end user, they will willingly come back without notifications.  this may seem obvious or simple, but the obvious answers are typically the hardest to answer and often ignored for that reason. consider for a moment what uber did for hailing a cab, or airbnb for vacation rentals.  these companies are using a technology to enable a product experience that truly provides a meaningful and rich opportunity for the consumer. they didn’t need notifications to drive consumers back – they provide a service that consumers didn’t know they needed.  it was an original, differentiated idea. the question is does any new leap that hurdle? if developers make it through the strategy phase and understand the core features to be designed, it’s a good idea to focus on new engineering solutions that can help provide safer, more mindful experiences related to engineering architecture and user data. engineering: currently, whether inside, facebook, google or amazon, most user data is stored inside centralized servers. this creates security and privacy concerns. how could developers create a more mindful approach to user data without storing it inside one of only a few major technology companies?  an architecture connecting people on a product via a follow, friending or another, similar, mechanism should have that data be encrypted and stored on the networked phones, versus a centralized server.  in short, passing the user-data baton to your friend(s) instead of a company. while still in its infancy, the proposed architecture would pair well with an overall product experience that is focused on the future generation of apps.  it would create a decentralized architecture that plays in the favor of the consumer instead of the company. it’s another example of a mindful ‘user-first approach’.  a large leap for startups, it’s a good example of thinking about new approaches and constantly challenging the norm, in this case, user data and security. pulling it all together: consider the following case study as a blueprint:  imagine proposing to build an inherently social application.  (this example is illustrative because many young entrepreneurs still have social at their core, and many businesses believe social is still a key first differentiator.) for this example answer: ‘why are you hoping to build such software?” followed by “do you feel this will help people or society in any positive or productive way?” (other than trying to get their attention?) those targeted questions focus the importance of what software has become and its larger impact on society. from there, try to shift the focus from higher level strategy — what are you building and why — to specific features: the design phase.  typically, there’s a friend or follow connection model; a way for people to see activity and some level of bothersome notifications, prompts, or updates. then focus on providing mindful alternative solutions to these standard features.  consider limiting the number of friend requests to help illuminate the product offering?

companies are beginning to explore these types of alternatives. consider what apple has done for map sharing in their recent ios release and google is following suit. less is more in the current and future world of software design and development. and mindful, deliberate decisions will provide the underpinning of the next generation of apps and larger software ecosystems. providing value in a congested market is very challenging.  but incorporating a mindful approach to product design enables a streamlined architecture that saves time and provides a framework to building products people actually want to use."
"ahead of spotify’s entry into the indian market, the streaming service this morning announced a global content deal with a leading indian film and music company, t-series, which gives it access to t-series’ entire indian song catalog. this includes bollywood and regional movie soundtracks, plus other non-film albums and emerging artist content, the company says. in total the catalog boasts more than 160,000 songs, and is available to spotify listeners as of today. the deal has been rumored to be in the works for some time, as spotify has been negotiating with top indian labels like t-series as well as times music, eros music and zee music to expand its catalog of local content before a launch in india. in november, t-series managing director bhushan kumar confirmed a deal with spotify was in its final stages. “we are bullish about india’s most popular music company tying up with the world’s most popular music streaming service,” kumar said today, in a statement. “we are confident that together we will be able to reach new markets and spread the love for indian music far and wide.” deals with labels aren’t the only way spotify is prepping for its indian debut. this past summer, it launched an indian music hub on its service called desi, which now counts more than 930,000 followers and includes its own playlist, desi hits. the indian market won’t be simple for spotify to win, as it will go up against local players, including gaana, which has more than 80 million users, in addition to saavn, wynk and global music services provided by apple, amazon and google. but gaining a foothold is key to spotify’s continued international growth, due to the market’s sheer size. spotify has grown to more than 200 million monthly users worldwide ahead of its launch in india, but is not profitable. (except for that brief moment it had, thanks to a tax benefit.) despite not yet operating in india, spotify says more than 4 million users are now regularly listening to indian music on the service. there also are an estimated 30 million indians living overseas, including in markets where spotify operates, like the u.s., mexico, brazil, the u.k, and germany, says spotify. the company is expected to launch in india in the first half of 2019, and that time frame hasn’t changed, we understand. “one of the ways spotify has helped revolutionise music discovery is through its ability to connect millions of fans with the best music and artists from all over the world in a way that just wasn’t possible before streaming,” said paul smith, director, head of international licensing at spotify, in a statement. “today’s deal with t-series significantly strengthens our indian music catalogue, bringing bollywood to more than 200 million spotify users worldwide. having t-series on spotify is hugely significant and shows our commitment towards providing the very best music for our users,” he added."
"u.s. smart speaker owners grew 40 percent over 2018 to now reach 66.4 million — or 26.2 percent of the u.s. adult population — according to a new report from voicebot.ai and voicify released this week, which detailed adoption patterns and device market share. the report also reconfirmed amazon echo’s lead, noting the alexa-powered smart speaker grew to a 61 percent market share by the end of last year — well above google home’s 24 percent share. these findings fall roughly in line with other analysts’ reports on smart speaker market share in the u.s. however, because of varying methodology, they don’t all come back with the exact same numbers. for example, in december 2018, emarketer reported the echo had accounted for nearly 67 percent of all u.s. smart speaker sales in 2018. meanwhile, cirp last month put echo further ahead, with a 70 percent share of the installed base in the u.s. though the percentages differ, the overall trend is that amazon echo remains the smart speaker to beat. while on the face of things this appears to be great news for amazon, voicebot’s report did note that google home has been closing the gap with echo in recent months. amazon echo’s share dropped nearly 11 percent over 2018, while google home made up for just over half that decline with a 5.5 percent gain, and “other” devices making up the rest. this latter category, which includes devices like apple’s homepod and sonos one, grew last year to now account for 15 percent of the market. that said, the sonos one has alexa built-in, so it may not be as bad for amazon as the numbers alone seem to indicate. after all, amazon is selling its echo devices at cost or even a loss to snag more market share. the real value over time will be in controlling the ecosystem. the growth in smart speakers is part of a larger trend toward voice computing and smart voice assistants — like siri, bixby and google assistant — which are often accessed on smartphones. a related report from juniper research last month estimated there will be 8 billion digital voice assistants in use by 2023, up from the 2.5 billion in use at the end of 2018. this is due to the increased use of smartphone assistants as well as the smart speaker trend, the firm said. voicebot’s report also saw how being able to access voice assistance on multiple platforms was helping to boost usage numbers. it found that smart speaker owners used their smartphone’s voice assistant more than those who didn’t have a smart speaker in their home. it seems consumers get used to being able to access their voice assistants across platforms — now that siri has made the jump to speakers and alexa to phones, for instance. the full report is available on voicebot.ai’s website here."
"amazon’s imdb movie website today announced the launch of a free streaming service, called freedive. the service offers viewers in the u.s. access to an ad-supported collection of tv shows like  fringe, heroes, the bachelor and without a trace, as well as hollywood movies like awakenings, foxcatcher, memento, monster, run lola run, the illusionist, the last samurai, true romance, and others. the content is free to watch without a subscription, and can be viewed on a phone, laptop or a big screen by way of amazon fire tv devices. imdb was already the home for some video content, including trailers, celebrity interviews and short-form original series such as the imdb show, casting calls, and no small parts. these are now being bundled into freedive, says the company, and will remain free to watch. the new service will also feature x-ray, the imdb-powered service that offers details about the title’s cast, crew, music, and more. “customers already rely on imdb to discover movies and tv shows and decide what to watch,” said col needham, founder and ceo of imdb, in a statement about launch. “with the launch of imdb freedive, they can now also watch full-length movies and tv shows on imdb and all amazon fire tv devices for free. we will continue to enhance imdb freedive based on customer feedback and will soon make it available more widely, including on imdb’s leading mobile apps.” the launch comes at a time when the streaming industry as a whole is focusing more heavily on avod – ad-supported video-on-demand. roku, for example, has been expanding the content available on the roku channel, which offers ad-supported movies, tv, news, sports, and other entertainment. plex at ces this week also said it would launch ad-supported content this year. for roku, the availability of free content on roku devices may help its hardware sales business, and clearly amazon has the same idea. however, roku is now augmenting its free service with additional paid subscriptions. meanwhile, amazon’s prime channels service for cord-cutters, which consists of optional paid subscriptions to channels like hbo, showtime, starz, and others, is only available to prime members. it’s a bit odd for amazon to have its tv shows and movies split up across two separate services – one from amazon, through prime, and another from its subsidiary imdb. the industry knew amazon was preparing to enter the avod space, it was only a matter of when. it was earlier rumored that the service would launch this past fall, but that didn’t come to pass. the new streaming service is live now at www.imdb.com/freedive. on fire tv devices, a new icon will appear in the “your apps & channels” row, says imdb."
"acko — a startup out of india that has taken on the country’s antiquated insurance industry with a digital-first product for drivers and others in transportation-related scenarios (for example, cancelled ticket insurance) — has raised more funding as it passes 20 million customers on its books. the company has closed a series c of $65 million from a list of investors that includes not just the co-founder and former ceo of flipkart, but also its arch-rival, amazon — speaking to the opportunity in the market as a number of players zero in on services. binny bansal, who until november had been the ceo of the e-commerce giant flipkart, and amazon are joined in the round by another strategic investor, intact ventures inc., the corporate venture arm of canada’s largest property and casualty insurer, along with rps ventures (the vc led by kabir misra, ex-managing partner at softbank), accel, saif and techpro ventures. amazon also led the company’s previous round of funding, a $12 million investment, last year. acko now has raised $107 million, and while it is not discussing valuation, a reliable source close to the company said it is in the region of $300 million. varun dua, the ceo and founder, spent 10 years in the insurance industry before founding acko, most recently building a site (called coverfox) aggregating different insurers’ quotes. but when it comes to the companies building the products themselves, he believes there has been very little innovation in the past 30 years. acko has built its business on two fronts up to now. a direct to consumer offering sells automotive insurance for people insuring for themselves, a business that has now insured some 200,000 cars. it also works with third parties to provide what was described to me as “microinsurance” products around other companies’ services. for example, ticket cancellation insurance, rider protection and driver protection for about 15 companies at the moment, including ola, redbus, zomato, urbanclap and amazon. amazon may appear a little out of left field in the list, but dua said that it’s because of trends specific to the indian market that the two work together. first, it offers vehicle insurance alongside cars that are sold on the amazon platform. but beyond that there is the opportunity to build services for what he calls “ecosystem” players in the market, those who provide a wide array of different services, and links to services, to consumers, leveraging their data on consumers to help shape those offers. “we continue to be impressed by acko’s focus on data-led innovations in the insurance sector that are solving for important customer needs in this sector. we are always excited to work with companies like acko that are led by missionary founders and management teams and we remain committed to investing in technology-backed innovations that address real customer problems,” said amit agarwal, svp and country head, amazon india, in a statement on the investment. while bansal is recently no longer in an executive role at flipkart, it’s notable that he is getting involved with acko at a time when dua says he would like to be working more with the company, which is also developing an array of services beyond the basic selling of goods to service india’s rapidly growing base on online consumers. “technology-led insurance is expected to play a significant role in growth of the underpenetrated insurance sector in india,” said bansal. “acko is the pioneer of digital-native insurance and i am delighted to partner in its exciting growth journey.” just as acko partners with companies to provide its insurance, it’s also working with an increasing array of insurers who are looking for better ways to tap consumers in the market. “we are thrilled to support acko in its mission to become the leading digital insurer in india. in addition to their innovative direct-to-consumer strategy, varun and his team have taken a creative approach by developing impactful distribution partnerships that allow millions of customers to protect assets that are meaningful to them,” said karim hirji, senior vice president of intact ventures. “we are excited to offer our expertise and partner with a company that shares our vision of creating simple and transparent new-age customer centric insurance products.” earlier today, i posted a story about drivezy and how it was raising a lot of money to double down on building its car-sharing network out of india. one of the gaps in the market for it is that only 7 percent of indians actually own vehicles. interestingly, that’s a number that dua thinks is a great start. “seven percent is still very large in india given the size of the population,” he said. “it’s the fourth largest auto market in the world, and the auto insurance space is likely to be worth $10 billion usd in the next several years. that’s big size for a company like us.”"
"last year, amazon joined the exclusive $1 trillion club. this year, it’s continuing to exude its stock market dominance. jeff bezos’ e-commerce giant accumulated $797 billion in market value on monday, ending the day trading up 3.4 percent at $1,629.51 per share and overtaking microsoft to become the most valuable publicly-traded company in the u.s. microsoft, which shot past apple to nab the title on nov. 28, closed up .1 percent at $102.06 per share monday with a market capitalization of $783 billion. according to fortune, november was the first time in eight years that microsoft successfully outpaced apple in the stock market, following concerns surrounding apple’s growth. apple, for its part, may not see itself at the top of this particular list again any time soon. the company’s chief executive officer tim cook issued a letter last week revising guidance for the company’s first quarter fiscal results. revenue estimates fell from an initial projection of between $89 billion and $93 billion to $84 billion, sending the company’s stock spiraling downward. today, apple failed to crack the top three most valuable companies, with google parent company, alphabet, grabbing the third spot instead. alphabet had a roughly $756 billion market cap monday afternoon, while apple’s hovered around $700 billion. “while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater china,” cook wrote in the letter. “in fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in greater china across iphone, mac and ipad.” as the largest u.s. stocks duke it out for the top spot, we can expect to see amazon, microsoft, apple and alphabet continue to trade places in 2019. apple’s trillion dollar market cap was always a false idol"
