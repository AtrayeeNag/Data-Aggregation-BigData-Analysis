"augmented reality looked like it was supposed to a ubiquitous success; apple and google and facebook seemed to say so. but things are taking a bit of time to get kicked off, so the startups in the space are having to get real weird with it. adventurous is an augmented reality scavenger hunt geared toward families, but it drags in enough elements of the real world to make it a pretty robust experience. this isn’t your typical ar phone app that you pop open once. for one thing, you have to be at a certain physical location in order to try it out, you have to make an appointment and, oh yeah, there are live actors involved. this may be one of the more odd companies in y combinator’s latest startup batch — it’s basically a kind of tech-enabled live theater. the company’s co-founders acknowledge that having appointments and live actors involved with an app isn’t the most scalable business model in internet history, but they say they’ll figure stuff out as they move along, and that for now the families and kids involved really like the experience. “we know that families are constantly looking for stuff to do with their kids, and not all screen time is good screen time,” adventurous co-founder jeany ngo tells techcrunch. adventurous co-founders jeany ngo and brian schulman when a family or group books an adventure, they meet at a designated location at a given time and get a rundown on the mission and story from actors in full dress and character, then they’re tasked with walking around to different physical locations where different geo-tagged experiences will pop up on their arkit or arcore-enabled phone and they’ll have to complete the tasks to move on. the experiences are designed to be around 45 minutes to 1 hour each and the whole shebang costs $15 per person. one of the big selling points of augmented reality as a medium is that it can theoretically gain an understanding of a location’s geometry and plunk down digital content in a way that’s tailored to your space. that may be true for something like google’s ar stickers, where it’s a little stationary 3d model, but when you start talking about actual story lines, the fact is that computer vision just can’t make reliable sense of a dynamic environment when it comes to a game or experience. suns out foxes out! enjoy the sunny day and help the foxes bring peace to the neighborhood with our latest adventure! download the app at https://t.co/frtxrnkmfa! pic.twitter.com/inbgtvtknd — adventurous co (@adventurousco) february 18, 2019 the company has been testing various locations for their ar adventures; right now they’re sticking with missions in san francisco’s chinatown and golden gate park. it’s a little unclear whether there could be any associated legal issues for a startup tying digital experiences to physical public locations, but the co-founders say they haven’t run in to any issues yet. with adventurous, the startup is banking on the robustness of an ironed-out experience to suck in fans and bring them back. the company’s co-founders foresee a world where narratives fit together like episodes in a tv series, bringing families back to book appointments to see what happens next. location-based entertainment has been a hit-or-miss vertical for the vr industry, though some startups have seen success. sandbox vr finished out a $68 million series b earlier this year in a round led by a16z. for ar startups, there haven’t been too many stories of entertainment experiences that have been strictly tied to geographic areas outside of event activations. while you can find pokéstops inside pokémon go, it isn’t a full linear experience that requires everyone to move along an identical path. adventurous is live now. if you’re in sf, you can book yourself a fancy scavenger hunt in augmented reality this weekend."
"with slack gearing up to go public and now seeing daily active users of 10 million with 85,000 organizations using it to help employees communicate with each other, facebook today released some updated numbers of its own for workplace, its enterprise-focused platform: the company says that there are now 2 million paid users on the service, not counting those who are using its free tier; and ngos and educational organizations using workplace for good — if you add these in you get “millions” more, facebook said, without providing a concrete number. the company’s paid tier starts at $3 per month per user, with pricing arranged directly with organizations when numbers exceed 5,000 employees. it started to charge for its service in october 2017, after first launching in october 2016. being facebook and already working at a huge scale with more than 2 billion monthly active users of its flagship service, the company has always pitched workplace as a tool for very large enterprises, and today it said that it now has 150 companies with more than 10,000 users each on the platform. these have included companies like walmart (the world’s biggest employer) as well as nestle, vodafone, gsk, telefonica, astrazeneca and delta airlines. picking these metrics to talk about the company’s growth is a strategic move for facebook. they are different enough from what slack measures that it’s not immediately easy to draw a comparison and claim that slack is much larger. at the same time, it highlights workplace’s success in an area that slack, teams and others competing in this space are also chasing: enterprise users. these are the most lucrative customer segment, as they not only generate larger recurring revenues, but they are often slower to churn once they do sign on to your service. workplace has made an effort over the last several years to add more features to bring the platform in line both with what basic facebook offers, as well as other enterprise communication services that workplace competes with more directly. that includes integrating with a number of key apps, although it’s still far from the hundreds that can be fed into slack. the numbers do not give us a total number of users on workplace but they set out also how facebook is continuing to drive the product forward as a diverse and distinct revenue stream apart from its ad-based consumer service. at the end of last year, facebook appointed a new head of workplace, karandeep anand, who came to facebook three years ago from microsoft (and thus has a close understanding of enterprise software). he works alongside julien codorniou to focus on the technical development of the product while codorniou focuses on sales, client relations and business development."
"it looks like facebook was not the only one abusing apple’s system for distributing employee-only apps to sidestep the app store and collect extensive data on users. google has been running an app called screenwise meter, which bears a strong resemblance to the app distributed by facebook research that has now been barred by apple, techcrunch has learned. in its app, google invites users aged 18 and up (or 13 if part of a family group) to download the app by way of a special code and registration process using an enterprise certificate. that’s the same type of policy violation that led apple to shut down facebook’s similar research vpn ios app, which had the knock-on effect of also disabling usage of facebook’s legitimate employee-only apps — which run on the same facebook enterprise certificate — and making facebook look very iffy in the process. google’s screenwise meter app for iphones (images: google) after we asked google whether its app violated apple policy, google announced it will remove screenwise meter from apple’s enterprise certificate program and disable it on ios devices. the company said in a statement to techcrunch: “the screenwise meter ios app should not have operated under apple’s developer enterprise program — this was a mistake, and we apologize. we have disabled this app on ios devices. this app is completely voluntary and always has been. we’ve been upfront with users about the way we use their data in this app, we have no access to encrypted data in apps and on devices, and users can opt out of the program at any time.” screen(un)wise first launched in 2012, screenwise lets users earn gift cards for sideloading an enterprise certificate-based vpn app that allows google to monitor and analyze their traffic and data. google has rebranded the program as part of the cross media panel and google opinion rewards programs that reward users for installing tracking systems on their mobile phone, pc web browser, router and tv. in fact, google actually sends participants a special router that it can monitor. originally, screenwise was open to users as young as 13, just like facebook’s research app that’s now been shut down on ios but remains on android. now, according to the site’s panelist eligibility rules, google requires the primary users of its opinion rewards to be 18 or older, but still allows secondary panelists as young as 13 in the same household to join the program and have their devices tracked, as demonstrated in this video below (which was created in august of last year, underscoring that the program is still active). unlike facebook, google is much more upfront about how its research data collection programs work, what’s collected and that it’s directly involved. it also gives users the option of “guest mode” for when they don’t want traffic monitored, or someone younger than 13 is using the device. putting the not-insignificant issues of privacy aside — in short, many people lured by financial rewards may not fully take in what it means to have a company fully monitoring all your screen-based activity — and the implications of what extent tech businesses are willing to go to to amass more data about users to get an edge on competitors, google screenwise meter for ios appears to violate apple’s policy. this states, in essence, that the enterprise certificate program for distributing apps without the app store or apple’s oversight is only for internal employee-only apps. google walks users through how to install the enterprise certificate and vpn on their phone. developers seeking to do external testing on ios are supposed to use the testflight system that sees apps reviewed and limits their distribution to 10,000 people. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data we’ve yet to hear back from apple, but google moving quickly to cancel its ios screenwise meter might save it from further punishment. we’ll see if apple still invalidates the certifications for all of google’s legitimate employee-only apps that run using the same certificate the way it did to facebook. that would throw a wrench into google’s product development and daily work flow that could be more damaging than just removing one way it gathers competitive intelligence. but rather than taking seven hours to respond as backlash swelled like facebook, google managed to get things sorted in a little under three. we’ve updated this post throughout in response to google’s statement that it will shut down the ios version of screenwise meter. facebook’s vpn app puts spotlight on kids’ consent"
"ben schippers contributor ben schippers is a co-founder of happyfuncorp. more posts by this contributor a modest proposal to make apps suck less tesla, a great family brand as the landscape for designing and building technology continues to evolve, so should the process for designing such systems. whether it’s for investing or helping to build a product, it’s important to convey a need for the entrepreneur or company to consider the long term impact of their product and to consider a more mindful and deliberate approach. product processes should always go in this order: strategy first, then design and lastly, engineering.  if you approach each process pillar with “why?” you will end up with a better product, a more engaged consumer and maybe even a valuable contribution to our ever bloated internet. phase 1, product strategy: within the product strategy pillar, it’s important to remember that just because someone can build a product, doesn’t mean they should.  just because a type of technology is available, doesn’t mean it will improve an experience.  purpose drives products, never technology for its own sake. recently at the 40th international conference of data protection, giovanni buttarelli, the conference host stated, “not everything that is legally compliant and technically feasible is morally sustainable.”  in other words, “should i build it?” is a question to always be asked during this phase. a clue to truly understanding this phase is to ask “how different is my idea before starting this phase vs. after?” the more an idea has evolved, the better. phase 2, product design: if designers keep bouncing between phase 1 and 2, that’s a good sign.  remember, ideas that die in phase 1 should be viewed as wins no matter how much work or time has been put in. while transitioning to the product design phase, it’s critical to remember: the consumer is tired … really tired. assume that most conventions simply don’t resonate with the consumer anymore; consider it a widespread technology burnout — app fatigue.  a perfect example of this is with notifications or similar mindless alerts. do notifications make the experience better?  do notifications make users want to use the software or the app?  if it’s a question that’s being asked, then the answer is a resounding, no.  go back to the strategy phase – rinse and repeat. the questions to ask are quite simply, “what will make a user want to come back to this product without notifications or similar tchotchkes?” what experience is created that’s going to resonate with the customer? if an overall user experience resonates with the end user, they will willingly come back without notifications.  this may seem obvious or simple, but the obvious answers are typically the hardest to answer and often ignored for that reason. consider for a moment what uber did for hailing a cab, or airbnb for vacation rentals.  these companies are using a technology to enable a product experience that truly provides a meaningful and rich opportunity for the consumer. they didn’t need notifications to drive consumers back – they provide a service that consumers didn’t know they needed.  it was an original, differentiated idea. the question is does any new leap that hurdle? if developers make it through the strategy phase and understand the core features to be designed, it’s a good idea to focus on new engineering solutions that can help provide safer, more mindful experiences related to engineering architecture and user data. engineering: currently, whether inside, facebook, google or amazon, most user data is stored inside centralized servers. this creates security and privacy concerns. how could developers create a more mindful approach to user data without storing it inside one of only a few major technology companies?  an architecture connecting people on a product via a follow, friending or another, similar, mechanism should have that data be encrypted and stored on the networked phones, versus a centralized server.  in short, passing the user-data baton to your friend(s) instead of a company. while still in its infancy, the proposed architecture would pair well with an overall product experience that is focused on the future generation of apps.  it would create a decentralized architecture that plays in the favor of the consumer instead of the company. it’s another example of a mindful ‘user-first approach’.  a large leap for startups, it’s a good example of thinking about new approaches and constantly challenging the norm, in this case, user data and security. pulling it all together: consider the following case study as a blueprint:  imagine proposing to build an inherently social application.  (this example is illustrative because many young entrepreneurs still have social at their core, and many businesses believe social is still a key first differentiator.) for this example answer: ‘why are you hoping to build such software?” followed by “do you feel this will help people or society in any positive or productive way?” (other than trying to get their attention?) those targeted questions focus the importance of what software has become and its larger impact on society. from there, try to shift the focus from higher level strategy — what are you building and why — to specific features: the design phase.  typically, there’s a friend or follow connection model; a way for people to see activity and some level of bothersome notifications, prompts, or updates. then focus on providing mindful alternative solutions to these standard features.  consider limiting the number of friend requests to help illuminate the product offering?  or if the product is a bit further down the road: consider putting up a paywall tier for potential customers not wanting to see ads.  or: consider not having an algorithm sort content and instead, show content as it comes in or give the consumer the option? companies are beginning to explore these types of alternatives. consider what apple has done for map sharing in their recent ios release and google is following suit. less is more in the current and future world of software design and development. and mindful, deliberate decisions will provide the underpinning of the next generation of apps and larger software ecosystems. providing value in a congested market is very challenging.  but incorporating a mindful approach to product design enables a streamlined architecture that saves time and provides a framework to building products people actually want to use."
"squad could be the next teen sensation because it makes it easy to do nothing… together. spending time with friends in the modern age often means just being on your phones next to each other, occasionally showing off something funny you found. squad lets you do this even while apart, and that way of punctuating video chat might make it the teen girl “third place” like fortnite is for adolescent boys. with squad, you fire up a video chat with up to six people, but at any time you can screenshare what you’re seeing on your phone instead of showing your face. you can browse memes together, trash talk about dms or private profiles, brainstorm a status update, co-work on a project or get consensus on your tinder swipe. it’s deceptively simple, but remarkably alluring. and it couldn’t have happened until now. how squad screensharing looks squad takes advantage of apple’s replaykit for screensharing. while it was announced in 2015, it wasn’t until june 2018’s ios 12 that replaykit became stable and easy enough to be built into a consumer app for teens. meanwhile, plus-size screens and speedy lte and upcoming 5g networks make screensharing watchable. and with instagram aging and snapchat shrinking, there’s demand for a more intimately connected social network. squad only launched its app last week, but droves of facebook and snap employees have signed up to spy on and likely copy the startup, co-founder and ceo esther crawford tells me. screensharing would fit well in group video chat startup houseparty too. to fuel its head start, squad has the $2.2 million it raised before it pivoted away from molly, the team’s previous app where people can make faqs about themselves. that cash came from betaworks, y combinator, bbg ventures, basis set ventures, jesse draper, gary vaynerchuk, niv dror, and [disclosure: former techcrunch editor] alexia bonatsos’ dream machine. next, squad wants to let people tune in to screenshares via url to unlock a new era of live broadcasting, and equip other apps with the capability through a squad sdk. “people under 24 do video chat way different than people 25 and above” says crawford. adding screensharing is “an excuse for hanging out.” serious ideas are preludes to toys screensharing has long been common in enterprise communication apps like webex, zoom and slack. i even called a collaborative browsing and desktop screensharing app my favorite project from facebook’s 2011 college hackathon. but we don’t just use our screens for work any more. teens and young adults live on the digital plane, navigating complex webs of friendships, entertainment and academia through their phones. squad makes those experiences social — including the “social” networks we often scroll through in isolation. charles and ray eames said “toys are preludes to serious ideas,” but this time, it is happening in reverse. squad co-founders from left: ethan sutin, esther crawford “the idea came from a combination of things — a pain we were experiencing as a team,” crawford recalls. my development team is constantly sending each other screenshots and screen recordings. it seemed ridiculous that i can’t just show you what’s on my screen. it was a business use case internally.” but then came the wisdom of a 13-year-old. “my daughter over the summer was bugging me. ‘why can’t i just show what’s on my screen with my friends?’ i said i think it’s not technically possible.” that’s when crawford discovered advances in replaykit meant it suddenly was possible. crawford had already seen this cycle of tool to toy before, as she was an early youtuber. back in the mid-2000s, people thought of youtube as a place to host videos about ebay listings, professional presentations or dating profile supplements. “they couldn’t imagine that if you let people just reliably and easily upload video content, there’d be all these creative enterprises.” use cases for squad after stints in product marketing at coach.com and stride labs, she built estherbot — a chatbot version of herself that let people learn about her. indeed, 50,000 people ended up trying it, convincing her people needed new ways to reveal themselves to friends. she met ethan sutin through the project and together they co-founded faq app molly before it fizzled out and was shut down. “molly wasn’t working; it had high initial engagement sessions, but then they would drop off. maybe it’s not the right time for the augmented version of you,” noted crawford. crawford and sutin pivoted molly into squad to keep exploring new formats for vulnerability. “what excited ethan and i was this mission to help people feel less lonely.” alone, together squad recommends apps to screenshare squad worked, thanks to a slick way to activate screensharing. the app launches to the selfie camera similar to snapchat, but with a + button for inviting friends to a video call. tap the screenshare button at the bottom, select squad and start the broadcast. to guide users toward the best screensharing experiences, a menu of apps emerges encouraging users to open instagram, tiktok, bumble, their camera roll and others. people can bounce back and forth between screensharing and video chat, and tap a friend’s window to view it full-screen. and when they want another friend to see what they’re seeing, squad goes viral. one concern is that squad breaks privacy controls. you could have friends show you someone’s instagram profile you’re blocked by or aren’t allowed to see. but the same goes for hanging out in person, and this is one reason squad doesn’t let you download videos of your chats and is considering screenshot warnings. what’s so special about squad is that it lacks the intensity of traditional video chat, where you constantly feel pressured to perform. you can fire up a chat room, and then go back to phoning as you please with your screen displayed instead of your blank face (though the android version in beta offers picture-in-picture so you can show your mug and the screen). “there’s no picture-in-picture on ios, but younger users don’t even really care. i can point it at the bed and you can tell me when there’s something to look at,” crawford tells me. a few people, alone in their houses, video chatting without looking at each other, still feel a sense of togetherness. the future of squad could grant that feeling to a massive audience of a celebrity or influencer. the startup is working on shareable urls that creators could post on other social networks like twitter or facebook that their fans could click to watch. tagging along as kylie jenner or ninja play around on their phone could bring people closer to their heroes while serving as a massive growth opportunity for squad. similarly, colonizing other apps with an sdk for screensharing could allow squad to recruit their users. squad makes starting a screenshare easy the startup will face stiff technical challenges. lag or low video quality destroy the feeling of delight it delivers, crawford admits, so the team is focused on making sure the app works well even in rural areas like middle america where many early users live. but the real test will be whether it can build a new social graph upon the screensharing idea if already popular apps build competing features. gaming tools like discord and twitch already offer web screensharing, and i suggested facebook should bring the feature to messenger when in late-2017 it launched in its workplace office collaboration app. helping a friend choose when to swipe right on tinder via squad in june i wrote that instagram and snapchat would try to steal the voice-activated visual effects at the center of an app called panda. snapchat started testing those just two months later. instagram’s whole stories feature was cloned from snapchat, and it also cribbed q&a stories from polly. overshadowed, panda and polly have faded from the spotlight. with facebook and snap already sniffing around squad, it’s quite possible they’ll try to copy it. squad will have to hope first-mover advantage and focus can defeat a screensharing feature bolted on to apps with hundreds of millions or even billions of users. but regardless of who delivers this next phase of sharing, it’s coming. “everyone knows that the content flooding our feeds is a filtered version of reality. the real and interesting stuff goes down in dms because people are more authentic when they’re 1:1 or in small group conversations,” crawford wrote. perhaps there’s no better antidote to the poison of social media success theater that revealing that beyond the instagram highlights, we’re often just playing around on our phones. squad might not be glamorous, but it’s authentic and a lot more fun."
"facebook co-founder sean parker bankrolled brigade to get out the vote and stimulate civic debate, but after five years and little progress the startup is splitting up, multiple sources confirm to techcrunch. we’ve learned that pinterest has acqhired roughly 20 members of the brigade engineering team. the rest of brigade is looking for a potential buyer or partner in the political space to take on the rest of the team plus its tech and product. pinterest as well as brigade ceo matt mahan confirmed the fate of the startup to techcrunch. while brigade only formally raised $9.3 million in one round back in 2014, the company had quietly expanded that series a round with more funding. a former employee said it had burned tens of millions of additional dollars over the years. brigade had also acquired causes, sean parker’s previous community action and charity organization tool. for now, brigade’s product will continue running managed by a skeleton crew until a partner or buyer can be found. after brigade launched as an app for debating positions on heated political issues but failed to gain traction, it pivoted into what causes had tried to be — a place for showing support for social movements. more recently, it’s focused on a rep tracker for following the stances and votes of elected officials. yet the 2016 campaign and 2018 midterms seem to fly over brigade’s head. it never managed to become a hub of activism, significantly impact voter turnout, or really even be part of the conversation. after several election cycles, i hear the brigade team felt like there had to be better ways to influence democracy or at least create a sustainable business. one former employee quipped that brigade could have made a greater impact by just funneling its funding into voter turnout billboards instead of expensive san francisco office space and talent. the company’s mission to spark civic engagement was inadvertently accomplished by donald trump’s election polarizing the country and making many on both sides suddenly get involved. it did succeed in predicting trump’s victory, after its polls of users found many democrats planned to vote against their party. but while facebook and twitter weren’t necessarily the most organized or rational places for discourse, it started to seem unnecessary to try to build a new hub for it from scratch. brigade accepted that its best bet was to refocus on govtech infrastructure like its voter identification and elected official accountability tools, rather than a being a consumer destination. its expensive, high-class engineering team was too big to fit into a potential political technology acquirer or partner. many of those staffers had joined to build consumer-facing products, not govtech scaffolding. mahan, brigade’s co-founder and ceo as well as the former causes ceo, confirms the breakup and pinterest deal, telling us “we ended up organizing the acqhire with pinterest first because we wanted to make sure we took care of as many people on the team as possible. we were incredibly happy to find that through the process, 19 members of our engineering team earned offers and ended up going over to pinterest. that’s about two-thirds of our engineering team. they were really excited about staying in consumer product and saw career opportunities at pinterest.” a pinterest spokesperson told us “we’re excited to welcome brigade engineers to pinterest, including former brigade cto john thrall and vp of engineering trish gray. as experts across areas like growth and product engineering, they’ve spent years building products that inspire people to go out into the real world and take action.” brigade had interest from multiple potential acqhirers and allowed the engineering team’s leadership to decide to go with pinterest. several of brigade’s engineers and its former vp of engineering trish gray already list on linkedin that they’ve moved to pinterest in the past few months. “we had a bunch of employees that took a risk on a very ambitious plan to improve our democracy and we didn’t want to leave them out to dry” mahan stresses. “we spent more time and more money and more effort in taking care of employees over the last few months than most companies do and i think that’s a testament to sean and his values.” mahan is currently in talks with several potential hosts for the next phase of brigade, and hopes to have a transition plan in place in the next month. “we’ve in parallel been exploring where we take the technology and the user base next. we want to be sure that it lives on and can further the mission the we set out to achieve even if it doesn’t look like the way it does today.” though the company’s output is tough to measure, mahan tells me that “brigade built a lot of foundational technology such as high quality voter matching algorithms and an entire model for districting people to their elected representatives. my hope for our legacy is that we were able to solve some of these problems that other people can build on.” given parker’s previous work with marijuana legalization campaign prop 64 in california and his new opportunity zones tax break effort, brigade’s end won’t be parker’s exit from politics. brigade’s breakup could still cast an ominous shadow over the govtech ecosystem, though. alongside recent layoffs at grassroots campaign text message tool hustle, it’s proven difficult for some startups in politics to become sustainable businesses. exceptions like palantir succeed by arming governments with data science that can be weaponized against citizens. yet with the 2020 elections around the corner, fake news and election propaganda still a threat, and technology being applied for new nefarious political purposes, society could benefit from more tools built to amplify social justice and a fair democratic process."
"earlier this week, slack announced that it has filed the paperwork to go public at some point later this year. the big question is, will the company exit into the public markets as expected, or will one of the technology giants swoop in at the last minute with buckets of cash and take them off the market? slack, which raised more than $1 billion on an other-worldly $7 billion valuation, is an interesting property. it has managed to grow and be successful while competing with some of the world’s largest tech companies — microsoft, cisco, facebook, google and salesforce. not coincidentally, these deep-pocketed companies could be the ones that come knock, knock, knocking at slack’s door. slack has managed to hold its own against these giants by doing something in this space that hadn’t been done effectively before. it made it easy to plug in other services, effectively making slack a work hub where you could spend your day because your work could get pushed to you there from other enterprise apps. the great enterprise chat race as i’ve discussed before, this centralized hub has been a dream of communications tools for most of the 21st century. it began with enterprise im tools in the early 2000s, and progressed to enterprise 2.0 tools in the 2007 time frame. that period culminated in 2012 when microsoft bought yammer for $1.2 billion, the only billion-dollar exit for that generation of tools. i remember hearing complaints about enterprise 2.0 tools. while they had utility, in many ways they were just one more thing employees had to check for information beyond email. the talk was these tools would replace email, but a decade later email’s still standing and that generation of tools has been absorbed. in 2013, slack came along, perhaps sensing that enterprise 2.0 never really got mobile and the cloud, and it recreated the notion in a more modern guise. by taking all of that a step further and making the tool a kind of workplace hub, it has been tremendously successful, growing to 8 million daily users in roughly 4 years, around 3 million of which were the paying variety, at last count. slack’s growth numbers as of may 2018 all of this leads us back to the exit question. while the company has obviously filed for ipo paperwork, it might not be the way it ultimately exits. just the other day cnbc’s jay yarrow posited this questions on twitter: is there any reason for microsoft not to buy slack for $20 billion? seems like a perfect fit and at $20 billion could be a bargain. — jay yarow (@jyarow) february 6, 2019 not sure where he pulled that number from, but if you figure 3x valuation, that could be the value for a company of this ilk. there would be symmetry in microsoft buying slack six years after it plucked yammer off the market, and it would remove a major competitive piece from the board, while allowing microsoft access to slack’s growing customer base. nobody can see into the future, and maybe slack does ipo and takes its turn as a public company, but it surely wouldn’t be a surprise if someone came along with an offer it couldn’t refuse, whatever that figure might be. can slack transform enterprise communication once and for all?"
"google has won u.s. regulatory approval to go ahead with a radar-based motion sensor that could make touchscreens look obsolete in the coming years. known as the soli project, the initiative began in 2015 inside google’s advanced technology and projects unit, a group responsible for turning the giant’s cutting-edge ideas into products. we’ve seen a number of soli’s technological breakthroughs since then, from being able to identify objects to reducing the radar sensor’s power consumption. most recently, a regulatory order is set to move it into a more actionable phase. the u.s. federal communications commission said earlier this week that it would grant project soli a waiver to operate at higher power levels than currently allowed. the government agency also said users can operate the sensor aboard a plane because the device poses “minimal potential of causing harmful interference to other spectrum users.” soli fits radar sensors into a tiny chip the size of an american quarter to track slight hand or finger motions at high speed and accuracy. that means instead of twisting a knob to adjust the volume of your stereo, you can rub your fingers over a speaker that contains a soli chip as if sliding across a virtual dial. under the regulatory order, you also would be allowed to air press a button on your soli-powered smartwatch in the future. aside from clearing safety concerns, the fcc also found that the sensing tech serves the public interest: “the ability to recognize users’ touchless hand gestures to control a device, such as a smartphone, could help people with mobility, speech, or tactile impairments, which in turn could lead to higher productivity and quality of life for many members of the american public.” we contacted google to ask for more detail and will update the story when and if we get a response. the regulatory consent arrived months after facebook raised issues with the fcc that the soli sensors operating at higher power levels might interfere with other device systems. the two firms came to a consensus in september and told the fcc that soli could operate at power levels higher than what the government allowed but lower than what google had requested. it’s a rational move for facebook trying to shape the rules for the new field, given its own oculus deploys motion technologies. the company also has invested in researching the area, for instance, by looking at a device that creates motion on the arm to simulate social gestures like hugging. the update on google’s technological development is a temporary distraction from the giant’s more questionable, revenue-driven moves in recent months, including a massive data leak on google+ followed by the closure of the online ghost town, its failure to crack down on child porn and its controversial plan to re-enter china reportedly with a censored search engine. [update: google removed several third-party apps that led users to child porn sharing groups after techcrunch reported about the problem.]"
"last week techcrunch reported that reddit was raising $150 million from chinese tech giant tencent and up to $150 million more in a series d that would value the company at $2.7 billion pre-money or $3 billion post-money. after no-commenting on our scoop, today reddit confirmed it has raised $300 million at $3 billion post-money, with $150 million from tencent. the deal makes for an odd pairing between one of the architects of china’s great firewall of censorship and one of america’s most lawless free-speech forums. some redditors are already protesting the funding by trying to post content that would rile chinese’s internet watchdogs, like imagery from tiananmen square and winnie the pooh memes mocking chinese president xi jinping’s appearance. reddit is raising a huge round near a $3 billion valuation the round brings the conde nast-majority owned reddit to $550 million in total funding. beyond tencent, the rest of the round came from previous investors potentially including andreessen horowitz, sequoia and fidelity. apparently frustrated that we had disrupted its pr plan, reddit today handed confirmation of the round to cnbc, which re-reported our scoop without citation. while cnbc reported in june 2018 that reddit would top $100 million in revenue, a reliable source tells us reddit only brought in $85 million in 2018 revenue. reddit’s ceo steve huffman has had his own problems with attribution after the exec was caught editing users’ comments to mislead viewers into thinking they were insulting their subreddit’s moderators. huffman managed to get off with just an apology and vow not to do it again, though he seemed to laugh off and excuse the abuse of power by saying “i spent my formative years as a young troll on the internet.” reddit cracks down on abuse as ceo apologizes for trolling the trolls reddit will have to compete for ad dollars with the google-facebook duopoly despite having less information about its users, who are often anonymous. reddit sees 330 million users per month across its subreddit forums for discussing everything from news and entertainment to niche types of pornography, conspiracy theories and other highly brand-unsafe content. meanwhile, users may be concerned that reddit’s policy views could be tightened as it cosies up to tencent. reddit has struggled with staff departures and user revolts over the years as it tries to balance freedom of expression with civility. the hope is the cash could help it pay for experienced leaders and more moderation staff to maintain that balance. but without proper oversight, the cash could simply scale up reddit and its problems along with it."
"facebook usage has declined for the first time in a decade, while video-centric apps like tiktok are being touted as the future of social media. entering this redefined playing field comes firework, a fast-growing social video app whose clever trick is something it calls “reveal videos” — a way for creators to take both horizontal and vertical video in one shot from their mobile device. video viewers can then twist their phone as the video plays to watch from a new perspective and see more of the scene. while snapchat pioneered the idea of vertical video, newer companies are trying to free viewers from format constraints. for example, jeffrey katzenberg’s mobile streaming service quibi is pitching its ability to offer an ideal viewing experience no matter how you hold your phone. as quibi ceo meg whitman explained last week in an interview at sxsw, the company has “created the ability to do full-screen video seamlessly from landscape to portrait,” she said. that sounds a lot like firework, in fact. firework has filed a patent on its own flip-the-screen viewing technology, which it believes will give creators new ways to tell stories. besides letting viewers in on more of the action, “reveal videos” also provide an opportunity for things like unexpected plot twists or surprise endings. the way this works is that creators hold their smartphone horizontally to film, and firework places a vertical viewfinder on the screen so they know which part of their shot will appear to viewers when they hold their phone straight up and down. this recording screen has some similarities to tiktok, as you can stop and start recording, reshoot the various parts and add music. “snapchat really pushed being vertical only,” explains firework chief revenue officer cory grenier, who joined the company from snapchat, where he was the first director of sales & marketing. “what we see is that most professional filmmakers want to show their work on vimeo first, and second on youtube. there isn’t this world where you can really frame the context and the characters of a cinematic story on vertical — it just can’t happen,” he says. beyond the technology involved with firework’s new filming technique, the company is also aiming to carve out a space that will differentiate it from other short-form video — whether that’s tiktok or, soon, quibi. firework’s videos are longer than tiktok’s at 30 seconds instead of just 15, but far shorter than quibi’s eight minutes. “thirty seconds is really the sweet spot between the snaps that are 10 seconds and something that’s longer-form,” notes grenier. “ten seconds is too short to really tell a story. you want to have a powerful opening, a clear middle and a really interesting or unexpected ending,” he says. this format lends itself better to short stories, rather than the remixed, music-backed memes found on tiktok, the company believes. but it also remains user-gen, as opposed to the high production value “tv quality” content shot for quibi using two cameras. (and a lot more money). instead, firework is focused on what it calls “premium user-gen” — meaning it will feature a mix of professional creators and up-and-comers. to date, firework has worked with names like flo rida, dexter darden (“maze runner”), model and miss usa olivia jordan, disney star jordyn jones, frankie grande and others. it’s also working with a handful of brands, including refinery29 and complex networks. but the company doesn’t want to inundate the app with content from brands, it says. in addition to the horizontal-to-vertical trick, firework is also doing something different in terms of fan engagement: it’s ditching comments. users can only privately message a video’s creator — they can’t comment on the video itself. “haters and trolls, they want an audience — they want to elicit a polarizing reaction. we remove that,” says grenier. and instead of “liking” a video, users can only bookmark the video or share it — an engagement that is styled like a retweet, as the video is posted to your profile with all the original credit intact. founded less than two years in mountain view and now relocated to redwood city with teams in la, japan and brazil, firework parent loop now tested a couple of apps that didn’t find product market fit before launching firework. its team of 51 full-time today combines both tech talent and hollywood expertise. this includes: ceo vincent yang, a stanford mba and previously co-founder and ceo at everstring; co-founder and coo jerry luk, employee no. 30 at linkedin and previously at edmodo; biz dev head bryan barber, formerly of warner brothers, universal pictures and fox; and cro corey grenier, noted above. unlike quibi, firework’s parent company loop now technologies has raised “millions” — not a billion dollars — to get off the ground. its early backers include original snap investor lightspeed, idg capital and an (undisclosed) early investor in musical.ly. (firework is poised to announce its series a in a few weeks, so is holding off on investment details for now.) the app launched last year and has been in an open beta until now. according to data from sensor tower, it has 1.8 million installs on ios, 55 percent in the u.s. firework claims it has 2 million registered users across ios and android."
"moka, a startup that wants to make talent acquisition a little more data-driven for china-based companies that range from smartphone giant xiaomi to burger king’s local business, announced monday that it has raised a 180 million yuan ($27 million) series b round of funding. the deal was led by hillhouse capital, an investor in top chinese technology companies such as tencent, baidu, jd.com, pinduoduo — just to name a few. other investors that took part include xianghe capital, an investment firm founded by two former baidu executives, chinese private equity firm gsr ventures and ggv capital. moka claims more than 500 enterprise customers were paying for its services by the end of 2018. other notable clients are mcdonald’s and one of china’s top live-streaming services, yy. it plans to use its new capital to hire staff, build new products and expand the scope of its business. founded in 2015, moka compares itself to workday and salesforce in the u.s. it has created a suite of software aiming to make recruiting easier and cheaper for companies with upwards of 500 employees. its solutions take care of the full cycle of hiring. to start with, moka allows recruiters to post job listings across multiple platforms with one click, saving them the hassle of hopping between portals. its ai-enabled screening program then automatically filters candidates and makes recommendations for companies. what comes next is the interview, which moka helps streamline with automatic email and message reminders for job applicants and optimized plans for interviewers on when and where to meet their candidates. that’s not the end, as moka also wants to capture what happens after the talent is on board. the startup helps companies maintain a talent database consisting of existing employees and potential hires. the services allow companies to keep close tabs on their staff, whose resume update will trigger a warning to the employer, and alerts the recruiter once the system detects suitable candidates. moka is among a wave of startups founded by chinese entrepreneurs with foreign education and work experiences. zhao oulun, whose english nickname is orion, graduated from the university of california, berkeley and worked at san francisco-based peer-to-peer car-sharing company turo before founding moka with li guoxing. li himself is also a “sea turtle,” a colloquial term in chinese that describes overseas-educated graduates who return home to work. li graduated from the university of michigan and stanford university, and worked at facebook as an engineer. when the founders re-entered china, they saw something was missing in the booming domestic business environment: effective talent management. “businesses are flourishing, but at the same time many of them fall short in internal organization and operation. to a large extent, the issue pertains to the lack of digital and meticulous operation for human resources, which slows down decision-making and leads to mistakes around talents and company organization,” says chief executive zhao in a statement. moka’s mission has caught the attention of investors. jixun foo, a partner at moka backer ggv capital, also believes china’s businesses can benefit from a data-driven approach to people management: “we are positive about moka becoming a comprehensive hr service provider in the future through its unique data-powered and intelligent solutions.”"
"linkedin has been forced to ‘pause’ a feature in europe in which the platform emails members’ connections when they’ve been ‘mentioned in the news’. this follows a number of data protection complaints after linkedin’s algorithms incorrectly matched members to news articles — triggering an internal review of the feature. linkedin told us it subsequently decided to suspend the feature in europe. the linkedin help center currently displays the following european caveat regarding the feature: at this time, members in designated countries (including european union, european economic area, switzerland) may receive notifications when their connections and members they follow in other regions are mentioned (subject to member settings), but we do not send mentioned in the news notifications that relate to members based in designated countries. we continue to evaluate coverage of additional regions, and encourage members to share relevant articles from their homepage. the decision to pause processing appears as a case study in the ‘technology multinationals supervision’ section of an annual report published today by the irish data protection commission (dpc). although the report does not explicitly name linkedin — but we’ve confirmed it is the professional social network in question. we reached out to linkedin with questions and it pointed us to this blog post where it confirms: “we are pausing our mentioned in the news feature for our eu members while we reevaluate its effectiveness.” linkedin adds there that it’s reviewing the accuracy of the feature, writing: as referenced in the irish data protection commission’s report, we received useful feedback from our members about the feature and as a result are evaluating the accuracy and functionality of mentioned in the news for all members. the blog post also points users to a page where they can find out more about the ‘mentioned in the news’ feature, and get information on how to manage their linkedin email notification settings. in the dpc report, the watchdog cites “two complaints about a feature on a professional networking platform” after linkedin incorrectly associated the members with media articles that were not actually about them. “in one of the complaints, a media article that set out details of the private life and unsuccessful career of a person of the same name as the complainant was circulated to the complainant’s connections and followers by the data controller,” the dpc writes, noting the complainant initially complained to the company itself but did not receive a satisfactory response — hence taking up the matter with the regulator. “the complainant stated that the article had been detrimental to their professional standing and had resulted in the loss of contracts for their business,” it adds. “the second complaint involved the circulation of an article that the complainant believed could be detrimental to future career prospects, which the data controller had not vetted correctly.” linkedin appears to have been matching members to news articles by simple name matching — with obvious potential for identity mix-ups between people with shared names. “it was clear from the complaints that matching by name only was insufficient, giving rise to data protection concerns, primarily the lawfulness, fairness and accuracy of the personal data processing utilised by the ‘mentions in the news’ feature,” the dpc writes. however a linkedin spokesman told us there is an algorithm involved in matching members to media articles — which he said is based on technology linkedin acquired when it bought machine learning startup newsle back in 2014. he also pointed to a linkedin help centre article, where the company acknowledges the imperfect capabilities of the feature — writing: “while this algorithm is good, it’s not perfect. it’s a good idea to check that the person or organization in an article is the same person or organization you’re following. if you see any news item associated with the wrong person or organization (or any offensive or inappropriate content in a news item), please report it by clicking the wrong person or wrong organization flag.” it’s not clear how linkedin can tweak an imperfect matching algorithm to ensure it doesn’t attract similar complaints in future if it gets identities mixed up again. the dpc notes only that it decided to suspend the feature “pending improvements to safeguard its members’ data”. it’s not the first privacy black mark against linkedin in europe. late last year, in its early annual report, on the pre-gdpr portion of 2018, the irish dpc revealed it had investigated complaints about linkedin related to it targeting non-users with adverts for its service. the dpc found the company had obtained emails for 18 million people for whom it did not have consent to process their data. in that case linkedin agreed to cease processing the data entirely. that complaint also led the dpc to audit linkedin. it then found a further privacy problem, discovering the company had been using its social graph algorithms to try to build suggested networks of compatible professional connections for non-members. the regulator ordered linkedin to cease this “pre-compute processing” of non-members’ data and delete all personal data associated with it prior to gdpr coming into force. linkedin said it had “voluntarily changed our practices as a result”. linkedin violated data protection by using 18m email addresses of non-members to buy targeted ads on facebook in its latest annual report, covering may 25 to december 31 last year — and published today — the irish dpc also records it has an open investigation of linkedin following a gdpr complaint related to the lawful basis it is using for processing personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted ads on its platform. this report was updated with a correction; linkedin was not ordered to suspend the feature by the dpc, as we originally reported but chose to do so following a review it carried out of the feature. we also included additional context from linkedin regarding the matching algorithm used to power the feature. in a further update we included details of the irish dpc’s open investigation into linkedin’s legal basis for processing personal data for targeted ads and behavioral analysis"
"facebook has confirmed it has removed the pages and profiles of a far-right political activist in the u.k. after concerns were raised in parliament about aggressive intimidation of politicians and journalists trying to go about their business in and around westminster. paypal has also closed an account that was being used to solicit donations for “political activism.” the intimidation is being conducted by a small group of extreme brexit supporters who have — ironically enough — lifted the “yellow vest” dress code from french anti-government protestors, and are also making use of mainstream social media and crowdfunding platforms to fund and amplify attacks on public figures in an attempt to squash debate and drive an extreme “no deal” brexit. (context: the clock is ticking down to march 29; the date when the u.k. is due to leave the european union, with or without a withdrawal deal.) in incidents widely shared on social media this week, individuals from the group were filmed live-streaming harassment of remain supporting conservative mp anna soubry who was mobbed and shouted at as she walked down the street to return to parliament after being interviewed live on tv in front of the palace of westminster where the group heckled her with repeat chants of “nazi.” after the thugs chanted nazi at anna soubry while she was on bbc, i went to check on her. but she had company… pic.twitter.com/ii7nidqmof — femi (@femi_sorry) january 7, 2019 members of the same group were also filmed with fisted smartphones, chasing and hurling abuse at left-wing commentator owen jones as he walked down a london street. in another video, one of the individuals leading the verbal attacks, who has been identified in the press and online as a man called james goddard, can be seen swearing viciously at met police officers and threatening to bring “war.” here's footage of far right 'yellow vest' leader james goddard telling people (police?) they're 'fair game' and threatening 'war'. when is enough going to be enough? when someone's hurt? killed? (via @dunc_saboteur) pic.twitter.com/yukjczspht — mike stuchbery💀🍷 (@mikestuchbery_) january 7, 2019 the speaker of the house of commons said today that he had written to the head of the met police to urge action against the “aggressive, threatening and intimidating behaviour towards mps and journalists” around westminster. the guardian reports that at least 115 mps have written to police requesting extra protection. contacted today about goddard’s presence on its platform, facebook later confirmed to us that it had pulled the plug. “we have removed james goddard’s facebook pages and groups for violating our policies on hate speech,” a spokesperson told us. “we will not tolerate hate speech on facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence.” earlier today one of his pages was still live on facebook, and in a post from december 14 goddard can be seen soliciting donations via paypal so he can continue “confronting” people. we also asked paypal about goddard’s use of its tools, pointing to the company’s terms of use, which prohibit the use of the platform for promoting “hate, violence, racial and other forms of intolerance that is discriminatory.” paypal declined to comment on “any specific customer’s account,” citing its privacy policy, but a spokesperson told us: “we do review accounts that have been flagged to us for possible breaches of our policies, and we will take action if appropriate.” a few hours later paypal also appeared to have pulled the plug on goddard’s account. a patreon page he had seemingly been using to solicit donations for “political content, activism” is also now listed as “under review” at the time of writing. but goddard remains on twitter, where he is (currently) complaining to his ~4k followers about being de-platformed by facebook and paypal, and calling other people “fascists.” (asked whether it’s investigating goddard’s use of its platform, a twitter spokesperson told us: “we have robust rules and terms of service in place which we enforce consistently and diligently when violations are found.”)  how should mainstream tech platforms respond to people who use their tools for targeted harassment? if you read companies’ terms and conditions, most prohibit abusive and intimidating conduct. though in practice, plenty flows until flagged and reviewed. (and even then, take-downs frequently fail to follow.) for all the claims from platforms that they’re getting better about enforcing their claimed community standards, there are countless examples of continued and very abject failure. facebook’s 2.2 billion-plus users especially make for an awful lot of content to wrangle. but none of these platforms is renowned for being proactive about weeding out violent types of speech they claim to forbid. and when intimidation is dressed up as political speech, and public figures are involved, they appear especially paralyzed. social media-savvy far-right groups grokked this loophole long ago (see: gamergate for a rough start date); and are continuing to exploit default inaction to get on with the violent business of megaphoning hate in the meanwhile. you could say platforms are being gamed, but the money they make off accelerated outrage makes them rather more complicit in the problem. the irony is it’s free speech that suffers in such a thuggish and febrile atmosphere. yet platforms remain complicit in its undoing, doing nothing to stop hate mongers turning hugely powerful high-tech soapboxes into abuse funnels. they do this by choosing to allow groups with fascist ideologies to operate freely until enough reports are filed and/or high-level political attention frowns down on particular individuals that they’ll step in and act. facebook’s community standards claim it aims to prevent “real-world harm.” but with such a narrow prescription, it’s failing spectacularly to prevent deliberate, malicious and coordinated harassment campaigns that are designed to sew social division and upend constructive conversation, replacing the hard-won social convention of robust political debate with mindless jeering and threats. this is not progress. there’s nothing healthy for society or speech if mainstream platforms sit on their hands while abusive users bludgeon, bully and bend public debate into a peculiarly intolerant shape. but we’re still waiting for the tech giants to have that revelation. and in the meantime, they’re happy to let you watch a live-streamed glimpse of mob rule. this report was updated with comment from twitter"
"we knew this moment was coming — we just never expected it to arrive so soon. jibo owners all over are reporting a final death rattle from their beloved home robot. the last message finds jibo announcing the imminent shutdown of it servers, noting that its interactions will soon be limited — likely meaning anything that requires an internet connection. “i want to say i’ve really enjoyed our time together,” jibo announces in a monotone that belies the gravity of the situation. “thank you very, very much for having me around.” the message comes to a close as jibo dances to a jaunty number through invisible robot tears. for jibo, it seems, this is a party, not a funeral. though some owners on the company’s facebook account are less than thrilled with how things ended. that is, sadly, the plight of the early adopter. the servers for jibo the social robot are apparently shutting down. multiple owners report that jibo himself has been delivering the news: ""maybe someday when robots are way more advanced than today, and everyone has them in their homes, you can tell yours that i said hello."" pic.twitter.com/sns3xav33h — dylan martin (@dylanljmartin) march 2, 2019 the company behind jibo came to an unceremonious end late last year, in spite of a successful kickstarter campaign and a healthy round of vc. i’ve said it before — if hardware is hard, then robotics are next to impossible. jibo, ultimately, was too beautiful for this world, it seems, leading the startup to lay off most of its workforce over the summer, selling its ip later that year. for robotics fans, it’s easy to find echoes of the sad, lonesome death of sony’s original aibo, which met a similar fate at the hands of shutdown servers. there’s a cautionary tale in all of this, of course. the plight of the early adopter is exacerbated when the customer is asked to make an emotional investment in a product, as is the case with a robotic pet or anthropomorphized home assistant. perhaps tis better to have loved and had one’s servers shut down than never to have loved at all. until then, enjoy this one final dance."
"no one likes being stalked around the internet by adverts. it’s the uneasy joke you can’t enjoy laughing at. yet vast people-profiling ad businesses have made pots of money off of an unregulated internet by putting surveillance at their core. but what if creepy ads don’t work as claimed? what if all the filthy lucre that’s currently being sunk into the coffers of ad tech giants — and far less visible but no less privacy-trampling data brokers — is literally being sunk, and could both be more honestly and far better spent? case in point: this week digiday reported that the new york times managed to grow its ad revenue after it cut off ad exchanges in europe. the newspaper did this in order to comply with the region’s updated privacy framework, gdpr, which includes a regime of supersized maximum fines. the newspaper business decided it simply didn’t want to take the risk, so first blocked all open-exchange ad buying on its european pages and then nixed behavioral targeting. the result? a significant uptick in ad revenue, according to digiday’s report. “nyt international focused on contextual and geographical targeting for programmatic guaranteed and private marketplace deals and has not seen ad revenues drop as a result, according to jean-christophe demarta, svp for global advertising at new york times international,” it writes. “currently, all the ads running on european pages are direct-sold. although the publisher doesn’t break out exact revenues for europe, demarta said that digital advertising revenue has increased significantly since last may and that has continued into early 2019.” it also quotes demarta summing up the learnings: “the desirability of a brand may be stronger than the targeting capabilities. we have not been impacted from a revenue standpoint, and, on the contrary, our digital advertising business continues to grow nicely.” so while (of course) not every publisher is the nyt, publishers that have or can build brand cachet, and pull in a community of engaged readers, must and should pause for thought — and ask who is the real winner from the notion that digitally served ads must creep on consumers to work? the nyt’s experience puts fresh taint on long-running efforts by tech giants like facebook to press publishers to give up more control and ownership of their audiences by serving and even producing content directly for the third party platforms. (pivot to video anyone?) such efforts benefit platforms because they get to make media businesses dance to their tune. but the self-serving nature of pulling publishers away from their own distribution channels (and content convictions) looks to have an even more bass string to its bow — as a cynical means of weakening the link between publishers and their audiences, thereby risking making them falsely reliant on adtech intermediaries squatting in the middle of the value chain. there are other signs behavioural advertising might be a gigantically self-serving con too. look at non-tracking search engine duckduckgo, for instance, which has been making a profit by serving keyword-based ads and not profiling users since 2014, all the while continuing to grow usage — and doing so in a market that’s dominated by search giant google. ddg recently took in $10m in vc funding from a pension fund that believes there’s an inflection point in the online privacy story. these investors are also displaying strong conviction in the soundness of the underlying (non-creepy) ad business, again despite the overbearing presence of google. meanwhile, internet users continue to express widespread fear and loathing of the ad tech industry’s bandwidth- and data-sucking practices by running into the arms of ad blockers. figures for usage of ad blocking tools step up each year, with between a quarter and a third of u.s. connected device users’ estimated to be blocking ads as of 2018 (rates are higher among younger users). ad blocking firm eyeo, maker of the popular adblock plus product, has achieved such a position of leverage that it gets google et al to pay it to have their ads whitelisted by default — under its self-styled ‘acceptable ads’ program. (though no one will say how much they’re paying to circumvent default ad blocks.) so the creepy ad tech industry is not above paying other third parties for continued — and, at this point, doubly grubby (given the ad blocking context) — access to eyeballs. does that sound even slightly like a functional market? in recent years expressions of disgust and displeasure have also been coming from the ad spending side too — triggered by brand-denting scandals attached to the hateful stuff algorithms have been serving shiny marketing messages alongside. you don’t even have to be worried about what this stuff might be doing to democracy to be a concerned advertiser. fast moving consumer goods giants unilever and procter & gamble are two big spenders which have expressed concerns. the former threatened to pull ad spend if social network giants didn’t clean up their act and prevent their platforms algorithmically accelerating hateful and divisive content. while the latter has been actively reevaluating its marketing spending — taking a closer look at what digital actually does for it. and last march adweek reported it had slashed $200m from its digital ad budget yet had seen a boost in its reach of 10 per cent, reinvesting the money into areas with “‘media reach’ including television, audio and ecommerce”. the company’s cmo, marc pritchard, declined to name which companies it had pulled ads from but in a speech at an industry conference he said it had reduced spending “with several big players” by 20 per cent to 50 per cent, and still its ad business grew. so chalk up another tale of reduced reliance on targeted ads yielding unexpected business uplift. at the same time, academics are digging into the opaquely shrouded question of who really benefits from behavioral advertising. and perhaps getting closer to an answer. last fall, at an ftc hearing on the economics of big data and personal information, carnegie mellon university professor of it and public policy, alessandro acquisti, teased a piece of yet to be published research — working with a large u.s. publisher that provided the researchers with millions of transactions to study. acquisti said the research showed that behaviourally targeted advertising had increased the publisher’s revenue but only marginally. at the same time they found that marketers were having to pay orders of magnitude more to buy these targeted ads, despite the minuscule additional revenue they generated for the publisher. “what we found was that, yes, advertising with cookies — so targeted advertising — did increase revenues — but by a tiny amount. four per cent. in absolute terms the increase in revenues was $0.000008 per advertisment,” acquisti told the hearing. “simultaneously we were running a study, as merchants, buying ads with a different degree of targeting. and we found that for the merchants sometimes buying targeted ads over untargeted ads can be 500% times as expensive.” “how is it possible that for merchants the cost of targeting ads is so much higher whereas for publishers the return on increased revenues for targeted ads is just 4%,” he wondered, posing a question that publishers should really be asking themselves — given, in this example, they’re the ones doing the dirty work of snooping on (and selling out) their readers. acquisti also made the point that a lack of data protection creates economic winners and losers, arguing this is unavoidable — and thus qualifying the oft-parroted tech industry lobby line that privacy regulation is a bad idea because it would benefit an already dominant group of players. the rebuttal is that a lack of privacy rules also does that. and that’s exactly where we are now. “there is a sort of magical thinking happening when it comes to targeted advertising [that claims] everyone benefits from this,” acquisti continued. “now at first glance this seems plausible. the problem is that upon further inspection you find there is very little empirical validation of these claims… what i’m saying is that we actually don’t know very well to which these claims are true and false. and this is a pretty big problem because so many of these claims are accepted uncritically.” there’s clearly far more research that needs to be done to robustly interrogate the effectiveness of targeted ads against platform claims and vs more vanilla types of advertising (i.e. which don’t demand reams of personal data to function). but the fact that robust research hasn’t been done is itself interesting. acquisti noted the difficulty of researching “opaque blackbox” ad exchanges that aren’t at all incentivized to be transparent about what’s going on. also pointing out that facebook has sometimes admitted to having made mistakes that significantly inflated its ad engagement metrics. his wider point is that much current research into the effectiveness of digital ads is problematically narrow and so is exactly missing a broader picture of how consumers might engage with alternative types of less privacy-hostile marketing. in a nutshell, then, the problem is the lack of transparency from ad platforms; and that lack serving the self same opaque giants. but there’s more. critics of the current system point out it relies on mass scale exploitation of personal data to function, and many believe this simply won’t fly under europe’s tough new gdpr framework. they are applying legal pressure via a set of gdpr complaints, filed last fall, that challenge the legality of a fundamental piece of the (current) adtech industry’s architecture: real-time bidding (rtb); arguing the system is fundamentally incompatible with europe’s privacy rules. we covered these complaints last november but the basic argument is that bid requests essentially constitute systematic data breaches because personal data is broadcast widely to solicit potential ad buys and thereby poses an unacceptable security risk — rather than, as gdpr demands, people’s data being handled in a way that “ensures appropriate security”. to spell it out, the contention is the entire behavioral advertising business is illegal because it’s leaking personal data at such vast and systematic scale it cannot possibly comply with eu data protection law. regulators are considering the argument, and courts may follow. but it’s clear adtech systems that have operated in opaque darkness for years, without no worry of major compliance fines, no longer have the luxury of being able to take their architecture as a given. greater legal risk might be catalyst enough to encourage a market shift towards less intrusive targeting; ads that aren’t targeted based on profiles of people synthesized from heaps of personal data but, much like duckduckgo’s contextual ads, are only linked to a real-time interest and a generic location. no creepy personal dossiers necessary. if acquisti’s research is to be believed — and here’s the kicker for facebook et al — there’s little reason to think such ads would be substantially less effective than the vampiric microtargeted variant that facebook founder mark zuckerberg likes to describe as “relevant”. the ‘relevant ads’ badge is of course a self-serving concept which facebook uses to justify creeping on users while also pushing the notion that its people-tracking business inherently generates major extra value for advertisers. but does it really do that? or are advertisers buying into another puffed up fake? facebook isn’t providing access to internal data that could be used to quantify whether its targeted ads are really worth all the extra conjoined cost and risk. while the company’s habit of buying masses of additional data on users, via brokers and other third party sources, makes for a rather strange qualification. suggesting things aren’t quite what you might imagine behind zuckerberg’s drawn curtain. behavioral ad giants are facing growing legal risk on another front. the adtech market has long been referred to as a duopoly, on account of the proportion of digital ad spending that gets sucked up by just two people-profiling giants: google and facebook (the pair accounted for 58% of the market in 2018, according to emarketer data) — and in europe a number of competition regulators have been probing the duopoly. earlier this month the german federal cartel office was reported to be on the brink of partially banning facebook from harvesting personal data from third party providers (including but not limited to some other social services it owns). though an official decision has yet to be handed down. while, in march 2018, the french competition authority published a meaty opinion raising multiple concerns about the online advertising sector — and calling for an overhaul and a rebalancing of transparency obligations to address publisher concerns that dominant platforms aren’t providing access to data about their own content. the ec’s competition commissioner, margrethe vestager, is also taking a closer look at whether data hoarding constitutes a monopoly. and has expressed a view that, rather than breaking companies up in order to control platform monopolies, the better way to go about it in the modern ict era might be by limiting access to data — suggesting another potentially looming legal headwind for personal data-sucking platforms. at the same time, the political risks of social surveillance architectures have become all too clear. whether microtargeted political propaganda works as intended or not is still a question mark. but few would support letting attempts to fiddle elections just go ahead and happen anyway. yet facebook has rushed to normalize what are abnormally hostile uses of its tools; aka the weaponizing of disinformation to further divisive political ends — presenting ‘election security’ as just another day-to-day cost of being in the people farming business. when the ‘cost’ for democracies and societies is anything but normal.  whether or not voters can be manipulated en masse via the medium of targeted ads, the act of targeting itself certainly has an impact — by fragmenting the shared public sphere which civilized societies rely on to drive consensus and compromise. ergo, unregulated social media is inevitably an agent of antisocial change. the solution to technology threatening democracy is far more transparency; so regulating platforms to understand how, why and where data is flowing, and thus get a proper handle on impacts in order to shape desired outcomes. greater transparency also offers a route to begin to address commercial concerns about how the modern adtech market functions. and if and when ad giants are forced to come clean — about how they profile people; where data and value flows; and what their ads actually deliver — you have to wonder what if anything will be left unblemished. people who know they’re being watched alter their behavior. similarly, platforms may find behavioral change enforced upon them, from above and below, when it becomes impossible for everyone else to ignore what they’re doing."
"james williams may not be a household name yet in most tech circles, but he will be. for this second in what will be a regular series of conversations exploring the ethics of the technology industry, i was delighted to be able to turn to one of our current generation’s most important young philosophers of tech. around a decade ago, williams won the founder’s award, google’s highest honor for its employees. then in 2017, he won an even rarer award, this time for his scorching criticism of the entire digital technology industry in which he had worked so successfully. the inaugural winner of cambridge university’s $100,000 “nine dots prize” for original thinking, williams was recognized for the fruits of his doctoral research at oxford university, on how “digital technologies are making all forms of politics worth having impossible, as they privilege our impulses over our intentions and are designed to exploit our psychological vulnerabilities in order to direct us toward goals that may or may not align with our own.” in 2018, he published his brilliantly written book stand out of our light, an instant classic in the field of tech ethics. in an in-depth conversation by phone and email, edited below for length and clarity, williams told me about how and why our attention is under profound assault. at one point, he points out that the artificial intelligence which beat the world champion at the game go is now aimed squarely — and rather successfully — at beating us, or at least convincing us to watch more youtube videos and stay on our phones a lot longer than we otherwise would. and while most of us have sort of observed and lamented this phenomenon, williams believes the consequences of things like smartphone compulsion could be much more dire and widespread than we realize, ultimately putting billions of people in profound danger while testing our ability to even have a human will. it’s a chilling prospect, and yet somehow, if you read to the end of the interview, you’ll see williams manages to end on an inspiring and hopeful note. enjoy! editor’s note: this interview is approximately 5,500 words / 25 minutes read time. the first third has been ungated given the importance of this subject. to read the whole interview, be sure to join the extra crunch membership. ~ danny crichton introduction and background greg epstein: i want to know more about your personal story. you grew up in west texas. then you found yourself at google, where you won the founder’s award, google’s highest honor. then at some point you realized, “i’ve got to get out of here.” what was that journey like? james williams: this is going to sound neater and more intentional than it actually was, as is the case with most stories. in a lot of ways my life has been a ping-ponging back and forth between tech and the humanities, trying to bring them into some kind of conversation. it’s the feeling that, you know, the car’s already been built, the dashboard’s been calibrated, and now to move humanity forward you just kind of have to hold the wheel straight i spent my formative years in a town called abilene, texas, where my father was a university professor. it’s the kind of place where you get the day off school when the rodeo comes to town. lots of good people there. but it’s not exactly a tech hub. most of my tech education consisted of spending late nights, and full days in the summer, up in the university computer lab with my younger brother just messing around on the fast connection there. later when i went to college, i started studying computer engineering, but i found that i had this itch about the broader “why” questions that on some deeper level i needed to scratch. so i changed my focus to literature. after college, i started working at google in their seattle office, helping to grow their search ads business. i never, ever imagined i’d work in advertising, and there was some serious whiplash from going straight into that world after spending several hours a day reading james joyce. though i guess leopold bloom in ulysses also works in advertising, so there’s at least some thread of a connection there. but i think what i found most compelling about the work at the time, and i guess this would have been in 2005, was the idea that we were fundamentally changing what advertising could be. if historically advertising had to be an annoying, distracting barrage on people’s attention, it didn’t have to anymore because we finally had the means to orient it around people’s actual intentions. and search, that “database of intentions,” was right at the vanguard of that change. the adversarial persuasion machine photo by joe daniel price via getty images greg: so how did you end up at oxford, studying tech ethics? what did you go there to learn about? james: what led me to go to oxford to study the ethics of persuasion and attention was that i didn’t see this reorientation of advertising around people’s true goals and intentions ultimately winning out across the industry. in fact, i saw something really concerning happening in the opposite direction. the old attention-grabby forms of advertising were being uncritically reimposed in the new digital environment, only now in a much more sophisticated and unrestrained manner. these attention-grabby goals, which are goals that no user anywhere has ever had for themselves, seemed to be cannibalizing the design goals of the medium itself. in the past advertising had been described as a kind of “underwriting” of the medium, but now it seemed to be “overwriting” it. everything was becoming an ad. my whole digital environment seemed to be transmogrifying into some weird new kind of adversarial persuasion machine. but persuasion isn’t even the right word for it. it’s something stronger than that, something more in the direction of coercion or manipulation that i still don’t think we have a good word for. when i looked around and didn’t see anybody talking about the ethics of that stuff, in particular the implications it has for human freedom, i decided to go study it myself. greg: how stressful of a time was that for you when you were realizing that you needed to make such a big change or that you might be making such a big change? james: the big change being shifting to do doctoral work? greg: well that, but really i’m trying to understand what it was like to go from a very high place in the tech world to becoming essentially a philosopher critic of your former work. james: a lot of people i talked to didn’t understand why i was doing it. friends, coworkers, i think they didn’t quite understand why it was worthy of such a big step, such a big change in my personal life to try to interrogate this question. there was a bit of, not loneliness, but a certain kind of motivational isolation, i guess. but since then, it’s certainly been heartening to see many of them come to realize why i felt it was so important. part of that is because these questions are so much more in the foreground of societal awareness now than they were then. liberation in the age of attention greg: you write about how when you were younger you thought “there were no great political struggles left.” now you’ve said, “the liberation of human attention may be the defining moral and political struggle of our time.” tell me about that transition intellectually or emotionally or both. how good did you think it was back then, the world was back then, and how concerned are you now? what you see a lot in tech design is essentially the equivalent of a circular argument about this, where someone clicks on something and then the designer will say, “well, see, they must’ve wanted that because they clicked on it.” james: i think a lot of people in my generation grew up with this feeling that there weren’t really any more existential threats to the liberal project left for us to fight against. it’s the feeling that, you know, the car’s already been built, the dashboard’s been calibrated, and now to move humanity forward you just kind of have to hold the wheel straight and get a good job and keep recycling and try not to crash the car as we cruise off into this ultra-stable sunset at the end of history. what i’ve realized, though, is that this crisis of attention brought upon by adversarial persuasive design is like a bucket of mud that’s been thrown across the windshield of the car. it’s a first-order problem. yes, we still have big problems to solve like climate change and extremism and so on. but we can’t solve them unless we can give the right kind of attention to them. in the same way that, if you have a muddy windshield, yeah, you risk veering off the road and hitting a tree or flying into a ravine. but the first thing is that you really need to clean your windshield. we can’t really do anything that matters unless we can pay attention to the stuff that matters. and our media is our windshield, and right now there’s mud all over it. greg: one of the terms that you either coin or use for the situation that we find ourselves in now is the age of attention. james: i use this phrase “age of attention” not so much to advance it as a serious candidate for what we should call our time, but more as a rhetorical counterpoint to the phrase “information age.” it’s a reference to the famous observation of herbert simon, which i discuss in the book, that when information becomes abundant it makes attention the scarce resource. much of the ethical work on digital technology so far has addressed questions of information management, but far less has addressed questions of attention management. if attention is now the scarce resource so many technologies are competing for, we need to give more ethical attention to attention. greg: right. i just want to make sure people understand how severe this may be, how severe you think it is. i went into your book already feeling totally distracted and surrounded by totally distracted people. but when i finished the book, and it’s one of the most marked-up books i’ve ever owned by the way, i came away with the sense of acute crisis. what is being done to our attention is affecting us profoundly as human beings. how would you characterize it? james: thanks for giving so much attention to the book. yeah, these ideas have very deep roots. in the dhammapada the buddha says, “all that we are is a result of what we have thought.” the book of proverbs says, “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” simone weil wrote that “it is not we who move, but images pass before our eyes and we live them.” it seems to me that attention should really be seen as one of our most precious and fundamental capacities, cultivating it in the right way should be seen as one of the greatest goods, and injuring it should be seen as of the greatest harms. in the book, i was interested to explore whether the language of attention can be used to talk usefully about the human will. at the end of the day i think that’s a major part of what’s at stake in the design of these persuasive systems, the success of the human will. “want what we want?” photo by buena vista images via getty images greg: to translate those concerns about “the success of the human will” into simpler terms, i think the big concern here is, what happens to us as human beings if we find ourselves waking up in the morning and going to bed at night wanting things that we really only want because ai and algorithms have helped convince us we want them? for example, we want to be on our phone chiefly because it serves samsung or google or facebook or whomever. do we lose something of our humanity when we lose the ability to “want what we want?” james: absolutely. i mean, philosophers call these second order volitions as opposed to just first order volitions. a first order volition is, “i want to eat the piece of chocolate that’s in front of me.” but the second order volition is, “i don’t want to want to eat that piece of chocolate that’s in front of me.” creating those second order volitions, being able to define what we want to want, requires that we have a certain capacity for reflection. what you see a lot in tech design is essentially the equivalent of a circular argument about this, where someone clicks on something and then the designer will say, “well, see, they must’ve wanted that because they clicked on it.” but that’s basically taking evidence of effective persuasion as evidence of intention, which is very convenient for serving design metrics and business models, but not necessarily a user’s interests. ai and attention str/afp/getty images greg: let’s talk about ai and its role in the persuasion that you’ve been describing. you talk about, a number of times, about the ai behind the system that beat the world champion at the board game go. i think that’s a great example and that that ai has been deployed to keep us watching youtube longer, and that billions of dollars are literally being spent to figure out how to get us to look at one thing over another."
"the influential massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful elizabeth warren has been a longtime critic of the consolidation of economic power by amazon, google and facebook. now she’s making their break-up a key component of her presidential platform. warren has just released her plan for breaking up big tech, in what seems like a watershed moment for a democratic nominee. since al gore famously (infamously?) “invented the internet,” democratic candidates have turned away from serious regulation of technology companies, preferring instead to receive their campaign contributions. eric schmidt and google donors were hugely important to the obama campaign, and big tech companies were among his biggest supporters. now, warren has said (on medium no less) that the massive market power that google, facebook and amazon wield is a threat and will be treated accordingly. “twenty-five years ago, facebook, google, and amazon didn’t exist,” writes warren. “now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. it’s a great story — but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.” the parallel she uses to make her case is the breakup of microsoft, which she weirdly calls “the tech giant of its time” (microsoft is still a tech giant), and holds as perhaps the last example when government went toe to toe with the technology industry. “the government’s antitrust case against microsoft helped clear a path for internet companies like google and facebook to emerge,” warren writes. but now the companies that flourished in the wake of the microsoft case have, themselves, become too powerful, she argues. “they’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. and in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,” writes warren. the key components of the warren plan include passing legislation that would designate companies with annual global revenue above $25 billion that provide marketplace, exchange or third-party connectivity as “platform utilities” and prohibit those companies from owning participants on their platforms. it’s a dragnet that now encompasses alphabet and amazon (but i don’t think it touches facebook?). the new law would also be required to meet a standard of fair and non-discriminatory use with their users, and platforms would be restricted from sharing user data with third parties. for companies with revenues below $25 billion, they’d be required to adhere to the fair use standard. warren would give state attorneys general and private parties the right to sue a platform for conduct that violates those requirements and the government could fine a company 5 percent of their annual revenue for violating the terms of the new legislation. as warren notes, “amazon marketplace, google’s ad exchange, and google search would be platform utilities under this law. therefore, amazon marketplace and basics, and google’s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. google search would have to be spun off as well.” the second (and more aggressive) part of warren’s plan would be the appointment of regulators to roll back acquisitions that warren deems anti-competitive. in amazon’s case that means whole foods and zappos would have to be spun back out. alphabet would have to unwind google’s acquisitions of waze, nest and doubleclick (but not youtube?), and facebook would have to part with whatsapp and instagram. “unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market — which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,” warren writes. her call for regulation is a big moment for the tech industry; it should also serve as a wake-up call for these companies to do more than just pay lip service to the problems their dominance is causing in the marketplace. as warren writes: we must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold — and do it in a way that doesn’t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data. we must help america’s content creators — from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians — keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like google and facebook. and we must ensure that russia — or any other foreign power — can’t use facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections. those are each tough problems, but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too. more competition means more options for consumers and content creators, and more pressure on companies like facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses."
"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here. 1. telegram gets 3m new signups during facebook apps’ outage in a message sent to his telegram channel, founder pavel durov wrote, “i see 3 million new users signed up for telegram within the last 24 hours.” durov doesn’t offer an explicit explanation for telegram’s sudden spike in signups, but he does take a thinly veiled swipe at social networking giant facebook. it’s probably not a coincidence that facebook and its related family of apps went down for most of wednesday. 2. google removed 2.3b bad ads, banned ads on 1.5m apps + 28m pages, plans new policy manager this year using both manual reviews and machine learning, google said that in 2018 it removed 2.3 billion “bad ads” that violated its policies — which at their most general forbid ads that mislead or exploit vulnerable people. 3. uber reportedly raising $1b in deal that values self-driving car unit at up to $10b uber is in negotiations with investors, including the softbank vision fund, to secure an investment as large as $1 billion for its autonomous vehicles unit. the deal would value the business at between $5 billion and $10 billion, according to a report from the wall street journal. 4. opportunity’s last mars panorama is a showstopper the opportunity mars rover may be officially offline for good, but its legacy of science and imagery is ongoing — and nasa just shared the last (nearly) complete panorama the robot sent back before it was blanketed in dust. 5. ai photo startup polarr raises an $11.5 million series a at the moment, polarr is probably best known for its photography app for ios and android, which utilizes machine learning and ai to improve image editing. the company says it has around four million monthly active users. 6. wework labs is launching a food tech accelerator wework is committing $1 million to back the first batch of companies. 7. facebook won’t store data in countries with human rights violations — except singapore when mark zuckerberg said in a lengthy blog post that facebook would not build data centers in countries with poor human rights, he chose to ignore singapore — known for a lack of privacy and freedom of expression."
"google’s latest effort to help users monitor and control their screen time, digital wellbeing, is making its way to more devices. initially available exclusively to pixel and android one device owners, digital wellbeing’s feature set is now rolling out to nokia 6 and nokia 8 devices with android pie, as well as on the new samsung galaxy s10. the site nokiapoweruser was first to spot the addition to nokia devices, which was picked up by xda developers and noted on their blog. xda also noticed digital wellbeing was available in the samsung galaxy s10‘s device settings, which makes it the first non-pixel or non-android one phone to ship with digital wellbeing installed. digital wellbeing, by way of background, is basically google’s version of apple’s screen time, and one of the key ways the company is addressing consumer concerns over device addiction. this has been a hot topic in the tech industry in recent months, as people have become more aware of unhealthy behaviors with regard to use of smartphones and their apps. in fact, a number of those involved with mobile apps’ creation have since come out to say that they were complicit in building apps that exploited weaknesses in the human psyche for the sole purpose of addicting users. one former google exec, tristan harris, kicked off a whole movement focused on this problem. he also created the center for humane technology, which encourages the implementation of new design principles that help put users back in control of their technology. in the meantime, companies are rolling out features to give us control over our behaviors around existing technology. for example, facebook last year changed how its news feed operates to reduce time spent on its site in favor of well-being. and facebook-owned instagram introduced a time well spent feature, by informing users “you’re all caught up” instead of offering an endless scroll. youtube lets you schedule reminders to take a break. we also have os-level features like apple’s screen time and google’s digital wellbeing for more comprehensive control and monitoring. specifically, digital wellbeing allows you to track your device addiction in several ways, including how often you check your phone, how many notifications you receive, how often you use apps and more, and allows you to set limits on usage, and configure settings like a nightly “wind down” mode and do not disturb settings. announced at google i/o 2018, this feature set first debuted on pixel devices last year as part of android pie. it later came to android one devices last fall. according to the standalone digital wellbeing app’s release notes, it exited beta on february 19. however, the note didn’t indicate it was coming to non-pixel, non-android one devices. google has not yet responded to a request for comment about the expansion of digital wellbeing."
"on the heels of news that tiktok has reached 1 billion downloads, the company today is launching a new initiative designed to help inform users about online safety, tiktok’s various privacy settings and other controls they can use within its app, and more. instead of dumping this information in an in-app faq or help documentation, the company will release a series of video tutorials that are meant to be engaging and fun, in order to better resemble the other content on tiktok itself. the safety series, called “you’re in control,” will star tiktok users and make use of popular memes, in-app editing tricks and other effects, just like other tiktok videos do. the videos will appear in the app and be available through the new @tiktoktips account.  the videos will focus on a range of privacy, safety and well-being settings and other safety-related policies. this includes tiktok’s community guidelines, how in-app reporting works, plus other settings for protecting your privacy, how to control comments, settings to manage your screen time and more. they’re not exactly your traditional how-to videos, however. instead, the videos showcase what’s often more serious issues — like being overrun with unwanted messages — in a humorous fashion. for example, in the video about configuring your message controls, angry commenters are depicted as shouting passengers on an airplane while the user is depicted by an overwhelmed flight attendant. “too many dms?,” the video asks. the flight attendant snaps his fingers, which causes most of the passengers to disappear. the scene returns to peace and quiet. it’s a simple enough analogy for tiktok’s younger user base to understand. this is then followed by a screen recording that shows you how to turn off messaging within the tiktok app’s settings. other videos have a similar style. a barking, growling dog is used to demonstrate restricted mode, for instance. a noisy crowd overlooking someone’s shoulder is the intro on the video about using comment controls. another video encourages the use of screen time controls, asking “can’t put your phone down?” and shows someone so wrapped up in their phone they aren’t watching where they’re walking. but the video about the community guidelines is maybe the most cringe-y, as it feels a bit like your parents reminding you to “play nice.” however, it still manages to set a tone for what tiktok wants to promote — a community for “positive vibes” where everyone feels “safe and comfortable.” at launch, there are seven of these short-form videos in the safety series, which will launch in the tiktok app in the u.s. and u.k on wednesday. in time, the company plans to add other tutorials and expand the series across its global markets, it says. of course, tiktok needs more than a series of videos to make its app a safe and welcoming community, the way it desires. it also needs a combination of policies, settings, controls, technology, moderation and more, the company says. and it needs to comply with coppa laws – which it’s basically skirting. that said, a focus on user education is an important aspect to this larger goal — and it stands in stark contrast to how facebook intentionally made its privacy settings so complex and difficult to find and use for so many of its earlier years that people gave up trying. how well tiktok can execute on user privacy and safety as the app grows still remains to be seen. for now, it tends to be talked about as either a wholesome and fun video experience, or an online cesspool filled with hateful content and child predators. it’s an app on the internet, so both versions of this story are likely true. there is no large user-generated content site — even those run by facebook, twitter and youtube — that has figured out how to properly police the hatefulness and evil contained in humanity. but tiktok, at least, takes care not to showcase that content in its main feed — you have to seek it out directly (or train its algorithm by never clicking on anything wholesome). but, so far, tiktok has been better reviewed by child safety advocates than you might expect. for instance, common sense media — a nonprofit that provides unbiased and trusted advice about all sorts of media, including apps — said that the app, used with parental supervision, can be “a kid-friendly experience.” the launch of the video series comes at a time when tiktok’s growth is surging. the app recently surpassed a billion installs across the ios app store and google play, including lite versions and regional variations, but excluding android installs in china, according to data from sensor tower. roughly 25 percent of those installs are from india, the report said. and around 663 million of tiktok’s total installs occurred in 2018, which made the app the no. 4 most downloaded non-game for the year. however, installs alone don’t tell the story of how many people actually use the app or how often. and a chunk of these could be the same user installing the app on multiple devices, or even bots used to push the app up the charts. in addition, parents often download the app their tween or teen is using for monitoring purposes, but don’t engage with the app or its content on a regular basis. below, is a compilation of all the new videos launching today:"
"insta-chat addicts, rejoice. you could soon be trading memes and emojis from your computer. instagram is internally testing a web version of instagram direct messaging that lets people chat without the app. if, or more likely, when this rolls out publicly, users on a desktop or laptop pc or mac, a non-android or iphone or that access instagram via a mobile web browser will be able to privately message other instagrammers. instagram web dms was one of the features i called for in a product wish list i published in december alongside a see more like this button for the feed and an upload quality indicator so your stories don’t look crappy if you’re on a slow connection. a web version could make instagram direct a more full-fledged sms alternative rather than just a tacked-on feature for discussing the photo and video app’s content. messages are a massive driver of engagement that frequently draws people back to an app, and knowing friends can receive them anywhere could get users sending more. while facebook doesn’t monetize instagram direct itself, it could get users browsing through more ads while they wait for replies. given facebook’s own chat feature started on the web before going mobile and getting its own messenger app, and whatsapp launched a web portal in 2015 followed by desktop clients in 2016, it’s sensible for instagram direct to embrace the web too. it could also pave the way for facebook’s upcoming unification of the backend infrastructure for messenger, whatsapp and instagram direct that should expand encryption and allow cross-app chat, as reported by the new york times’ mike isaac. mobile reverse-engineering specialist and frequent techcrunch tipster jane manchun wong alerted us to instagram’s test. it’s not available to users yet, as it’s still being internally “dogfooded” — used heavily by employees to identify bugs or necessary product changes. but she was able to dig past security and access the feature from both a desktop computer and mobile web browser. in the current design, direct on the web is available from a direct arrow icon in the top right of the screen. the feature looks like it will use an instagram.com/direct/…. url structure. if the feature becomes popular, perhaps facebook will break it out with its own direct destination website similar to https://www.messenger.com, which launched in 2015. instagram began testing a standalone direct app last year, but it’s yet to be officially launched and doesn’t seem exceedingly popular. instagram’s web experience has long lagged behind its native apps. you still can’t post stories from the desktop like you can with facebook stories. it only added notifications on the web in 2016 and explore, plus some other features, in 2017. instagram did not respond to requests for comment before press time. the company rarely provides a statement on internal features in development until they’re being externally tested on the public, at which point it typically tells us “we’re always testing ways to improve the instagram experience.” [update: instagram confirms to techcrunch it’s not publicly testing this, which is its go-to line when a product surfaces that’s still in internal development. meanwhile, wong notes that instagram has now cut off her access to the web direct feature.] after cloning snapchat stories to create instagram stories, the facebook-owned app decimated snap’s growth rate. that left snapchat to focus on premium video and messaging. last year instagram built igtv to compete with snapchat discover. and now with it testing a web version of direct, it seems poised to challenge snap for chat too."
"a significant ftc ruling issued today will see video app tiktok fined $5.7 million for violating u.s. children’s privacy laws, and will impact how the app works for kids under the age of 13. in an app update being released today, all users will need to verify their age, and the under 13-year-olds will then be directed to a separate, more restricted in-app experience that protects their personal information and prevents them from publishing videos to tiktok . in a bit of bad timing for the popular video app, the ruling comes on the same day that tiktok began promoting its new safety series designed to help keep its community informed of its privacy and safety tools. the federal trade commission had begun looking into tiktok back when it was known as musical.ly, and the ruling itself is a settlement with musical.ly. the industry self-regulatory group children’s advertising review unit (caru) had last spring referred musical.ly to the ftc for violating u.s. children’s privacy law by collecting personal information for users under the age of 13 without parental consent. (the complaint, filed by the department of justice on behalf of the commission, is here.) musical.ly, technically, no longer exists. it was acquired by chinese firm bytedance in 2017. the app was then shut down mid-2018 while its user base was merged into tiktok. but its regulatory issues followed it to its new home. according to the u.s. children’s privacy law coppa, operators of apps and websites aimed at young users under the age of 13 can’t collect personal data like email addresses, ip addresses, geolocation information or other identifiers without parental consent. but the musical.ly app required users to provide an email address, phone number, username, first and last name, a short biography and a profile picture, the ftc claims. the also app allowed users to interact with others by commenting on their videos and sending direct messages. in addition, user accounts were public by default, which meant that a child’s profile bio, username, picture and videos could be seen by other users, the ftc explained today in its press release. it also noted that there were reports of adults trying to contact children in musical.ly, and until october 2016 there was a feature that let others view nearby users within a 50-mile radius. “the operators of musical.ly—now known as tiktok—knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13,” said ftc chairman joe simons, in a statement. “this record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children: we take enforcement of coppa very seriously, and we will not tolerate companies that flagrantly ignore the law.” coppa law, of course, becomes a bit complex to implement for apps like tiktok that sit in a gray area between being oriented toward adults and being aimed at kids. specifically, apps preferred by tweens and teens — like snapchat, instagram, youtube and tiktok — are often clamored for by younger, under-13 kids, and parents often comply. but some parents are caught off guard by these apps. the ftc says musical.ly had fielded “thousands of complaints” from parents because their children under the age of 13 had created musical.ly accounts. in addition to the $5.7 million fine, the ftc settlement with musical.ly includes an agreement that will impact how the tiktok app operates. it says tiktok is now considered a “mixed audience” app, which means there needs to be an age gate implemented on the app. instead of locking out under-13 users from the tiktok service, younger users will be directed to a different in-app experience that restricts tiktok from collecting the personal information prohibited by coppa. tiktok is also complying with the ruling by making significant changes to its app. it will now restrict under-13 kids from being able to film and publish their videos to the tiktok app. it will also take down all videos from kids under 13. instead, the under-13 crowd will only be able to like content and follow users. they will be able to create and save videos to their device — but not to the public tiktok network. nor can they share videos on the app with their friends if they use tiktok via a private account. as tiktok already has a large number of younger kids on its app, it will push an app update today that displays the new age gate to both new and existing users alike. kids will then need to verify their birthday in order to be directed to the appropriate experience. this is not likely going to have an impact on how many kids use tiktok, however. kids today already know to lie to age pop-ups so they can enter a restricted app. that’s how they set up accounts on facebook, instagram, snapchat and elsewhere. however, the move at least puts tiktok on a level playing field with other “mixed audience” apps instead of allowing it to pretend u.s. children’s privacy laws do not exist. tiktok reportedly has been installed a billion times worldwide, according to recent data from sensor tower. the company doesn’t publicly disclose its figures, but the ftc says since 2014, more than 200 million users had downloaded the musical.ly app worldwide, with 65 million accounts registered in the united states. the commission vote to authorize the staff to refer the complaint to the department of justice and to approve the proposed consent decree was 5-0. commissioner rohit chopra and commissioner rebecca kelly slaughter issued a separate statement, shared below: the federal trade commission’s action to crack down on the privacy practices of musical.ly, now known as tiktok, is a major milestone for our children’s online privacy protection act (coppa) enforcement program. agency staff uncovered disturbing practices, including collecting and exposing the location and other sensitive data of young children. in our view, these practices reflected the company’s willingness to pursue growth even at the expense of endangering children. the agency secured a record-setting civil penalty and deletion of ill-gotten data, as well as other remedies to stop this egregious conduct. this is a big win in the fight to protect children’s privacy. this investigation began before the current commission was in place. ftc investigations typically focus on individual accountability only in certain circumstances—and the effect has been that individuals at large companies have often avoided scrutiny. we should move away from this approach. executives of big companies who call the shots as companies break the law should be held accountable. when any company appears to have a made a business decision to violate or disregard the law, the commission should identify and investigate those individuals who made or ratified that decision and evaluate whether to charge them. as we continue to pursue violations of law, we should prioritize uncovering the role of corporate officers and directors and hold accountable everyone who broke the law."
"mark zuckerberg says it might be right for facebook to let people pay to not see ads, but that it would feel wrong to charge users for extra privacy controls. that’s just one of the fascinating philosophical views the ceo shared during the first of his public talks he’s promised as part of his 2019 personal challenge. talking to harvard law and computer science professor jonathan zittrain on the campus of the university he dropped out of, zuckerberg managed to escape the 100-minute conversation with just a few gaffes. at one point he said “we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations”. zittrain swiftly reminded him that’s exactly what facebook portal is, and zuckerberg tried to deflect by saying portal’s recordings would be encrypted. later zuckerberg mentioned “the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see” which is pretty sad and derisive assessment of the personal photos and status updates people share. and when he suggested crowdsourced fact-checking, zittrain chimed in that this could become an avenue for “astroturfing” where mobs of users provide purposefully biased information to promote their interests, like a political group’s supporting voting that their opponents’ facts are lies. while sometimes avoiding hard stances on questions, zuckerberg was otherwise relatively logical and coherent. policy and cooperating with governments the ceo touched on his borderline content policy that quietly demotes posts that come close to breaking its policy against nudity, hate speech etc that otherwise are the most sensational and get the most distribution but don’t make people feel good. zuckerberg noted some progress here, saying “a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that.” this aligns with zuckerberg contemplating facebook’s role as a “data fiduciary” where rather than necessarily giving in to users’ urges or prioritizing its short-term share price, the company tries to do what’s in the best long-term interest of its communities. “there’s a hard balance here which is — i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want” he said. essentially, people might tap on clickbait even if it doesn’t make them feel good. on working with governments, zuckerberg explained how incentives weren’t always aligned, like when law enforcement is monitoring someone accidentally dropping clues about their crimes and collaborators. the government and society might benefit from that continued surveillance but facebook might want to immediately suspend the account if it found out. “but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, ‘hey, this is where we’re at'”, implying facebook might purposefully allow that person to keep incriminating themselves to assist the authorities. but disagreements between governments can flare up, zuckerberg notes that “we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted.” that’s likely a reference to the 2016 arrest of facebook’s vp for latin amercia diego dzodan over whatsapp’s encryption preventing the company from providing evidence for a drug case. decentralizing facebook the tradeoffs of encryption and decentralization were a central theme. he discussed how while many people fear how encryption could mask illegal or offensive activity, facebook doesn’t have to peek at someone’s actual content to determine they’re violating policy. “one of the — i guess, somewhat surprising to me — findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content” zuckerberg said. with facebook rapidly building out a blockchain team to potentially launch a cryptocurrency for fee-less payments or an identity layer for decentralized applications, zittrain asked about the potential for letting users control which other apps they give their profile information to without facebook as an intermediary. san jose, ca – may 01: facebook ceo mark zuckerberg (photo by justin sullivan/getty images) zuckerberg stressed that at facebook’s scale, moving to a less efficient distributed architecture would be extremely “computationally intense” though it might eventually be possible. instead, he said “one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed.” this might be attractive to developers who would know facebook couldn’t cut them off from the users. the problem is that if a developer was abusing users, zuckerberg fears that “in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution?” no “pay for privacy” but perhaps most novel and urgent were zuckerberg’s comments on the secondary questions raised by where facebook should let people pay to remove ads. “you start getting into a principle question which is ‘are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people?’ and my answer to that is a hard no.” facebook has promised to always operate free version so everyone can have a voice. yet some including myself have suggested that a premium ad-free subscription to facebook could help ween it off maximizing data collection and engagement, though it might break facebook’s revenue machine by pulling the most affluent and desired users out of the ad targeting pool. “what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle” zuckerberg expands. “it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong.” back in may, zuckerberg announced facebook would build a clear history button in 2018 that deletes all the web browsing data the social network has collected about you, but that data’s deep integration into the company’s systems has delayed the launch. research suggests users don’t want the inconvenience of getting logged out of all their facebook connected services, though, they’d like to hide certain data from the company. “clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay.” of all the apologies, promises, and predictions zuckerberg has made recently, this pledge might instill the most confidence. while some might think of zuckerberg as a data tyrant out to absorb and exploit as much of our personal info as possible, there are at least lines he’s not willing to cross. facebook could try to charge you for privacy, but it won’t. and given facebook’s dominance in social networking and messaging plus zuckerberg’s voting control of the company, a greedier man could make the internet much worse. — transcript – mark zuckerberg at harvard / first personal challenge 2019 jonathan zittrain: very good. so, thank you, mark, for coming to talk to me and to our students from the techtopia program and from my “internet and society” course at harvard law school. we’re really pleased to have a chance to talk about any number of issues and we should just dive right in. so, privacy, autonomy, and information fiduciaries. mark zuckerberg: all right! jonathan zittrain: love to talk about that. mark zuckerberg: yeah! i read your piece in the new york times. jonathan zittrain: the one with the headline that said, “mark zuckerberg can fix this mess”? mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: although that was last year. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: that’s true! are you suggesting it’s all fixed? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no. no. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: okay, good. so– jonathan zittrain: i’m suggesting that i’m curious whether you still think that we can fix this mess? jonathan zittrain: ah! <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i hope– <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “hope springs eternal”– mark zuckerberg: yeah, there you go. jonathan zittrain: –is my motto. so, all right, let me give a quick characterization of this idea that the coinage and the scaffolding for it is from my colleague, jack balkin, at yale. and the two of us have been developing it out further. there are a standard number of privacy questions with which you might have some familiarity, having to do with people conveying information that they know they’re conveying or they’re not so sure they are, but “mouse droppings” as we used to call them when they run in the rafters of the internet and leave traces. and then the standard way of talking about that is you want to make sure that that stuff doesn’t go where you don’t want it to go. and we call that “informational privacy”. we don’t want people to know stuff that we want maybe our friends only to know. and on a place like facebook, you’re supposed to be able to tweak your settings and say, “give them to this and not to that.” but there’s also ways in which stuff that we share with consent could still sort of be used against us and it feels like, “well, you consented,” may not end the discussion. and the analogy that my colleague jack brought to bear was one of a doctor and a patient or a lawyer and a client or– sometimes in america, but not always– a financial advisor and a client that says that those professionals have certain expertise, they get trusted with all sorts of sensitive information from their clients and patients and, so, they have an extra duty to act in the interests of those clients even if their own interests conflict. and, so, maybe just one quick hypo to get us started. i wrote a piece in 2014, that maybe you read, that was a hypothetical about elections in which it said, “just hypothetically, imagine that facebook had a view about which candidate should win and they reminded people likely to vote for the favored candidate that it was election day,” and to others they simply sent a cat photo. would that be wrong? and i find– i have no idea if it’s illegal; it does seem wrong to me and it might be that the fiduciary approach captures what makes it wrong. mark zuckerberg: all right. so, i think we could probably spend the whole next hour just talking about that! <laughter> mark zuckerberg: so, i read your op-ed and i also read balkin’s blogpost on information fiduciaries. and i’ve had a conversation with him, too. jonathan zittrain: great. mark zuckerberg: and the– at first blush, kind of reading through this, my reaction is there’s a lot here that makes sense. right? the idea of us having a fiduciary relationship with the people who use our services is kind of intuitively– it’s how we think about how we’re building what we’re building. so, reading through this, it’s like, all right, you know, a lot of people seem to have this mistaken notion that when we’re putting together news feed and doing ranking that we have a team of people who are focused on maximizing the time that people spend, but that’s not the goal that we give them. we tell people on the team, “produce the service–” that we think is going to be the highest quality that– we try to ground it in kind of getting people to come in and tell us, right, of the content that we could potentially show what is going to be– they tell us what they want to see, then we build models that kind of– that can predict that, and build that service. jonathan zittrain: and, by the way, was that always the case or– mark zuckerberg: no. jonathan zittrain: –was that a place you got to through some course adjustments? mark zuckerberg: through course adjustments. i mean, you start off using simpler signals like what people are clicking on in feed, but then you pretty quickly learn, “hey, that gets you to local optimum,” right? where if you’re focusing on what people click on and predicting what people click on, then you select for click bait. right? so, pretty quickly you realize from real feedback, from real people, that’s not actually what people want. you’re not going to build the best service by doing that. so, you bring in people and actually have these panels of– we call it “getting to ground truth”– of you show people all the candidates for what can be shown to them and you have people say, “what’s the most meaningful thing that i wish that this system were showing us? so, all this is kind of a way of saying that our own self image of ourselves and what we’re doing is that we’re acting as fiduciaries and trying to build the best services for people. where i think that this ends up getting interesting is then the question of who gets to decide in the legal sense or the policy sense of what’s in people’s best interest? right? so, we come in every day and think, “hey, we’re building a service where we’re ranking newsfeed trying to show people the most relevant content with an assumption that’s backed by data; that, in general, people want us to show them the most relevant content. but, at some level, you could ask the question which is “who gets to decide that ranking newsfeed or showing relevant ads?” or any of the other things that we choose to work on are actually in people’s interest. and we’re doing the best that we can to try to build the services [ph?] that we think are the best. at the end of the day, a lot of this is grounded in “people choose to use it.” right? because, clearly, they’re getting some value from it. but then there are all these questions like you say about, you have– about where people can effectively give consent and not. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: so, i think that there’s a lot of interesting questions in this to unpack about how you’d implement a model like that. but, at a high level i think, you know, one of the things that i think about in terms of we’re running this big company; it’s important in society that people trust the institutions of society. clearly, i think we’re in a position now where people rightly have a lot of questions about big internet companies, facebook in particular, and i do think getting to a point there there’s the right regulation and rules in place just provides a kind of societal guardrail framework where people can have confidence that, okay, these companies are operating within a framework that we’ve all agreed. that’s better than them just doing whatever they want. and i think that that would give people confidence. so, figuring out what that framework is, i think, is a really important thing. and i’m sure we’ll talk about that as it relates– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –to a lot of the content areas today. but getting to that question of how do you– “who determines what’s in people’s best interest, if not people themselves?”jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –is a really interesting question. jonathan zittrain: yes, so, we should surely talk about that. so, on our agenda is the “who decides?” question. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: other agenda items include– just as you say, the fiduciary framework sounds nice to you– doctors, patients, facebook users. and i hear you saying that’s pretty much where you’re wanting to end up anyway. there are some interesting questions about what people want, versus what they want to want. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: people will say “on january 1st, what i want–” new year’s resolution– “is a gym membership.” and then on january 2nd, they don’t want to go to the gym. they want to want to go to the gym, but they never quite make it. and then, of course, a business model of pay for the whole year ahead of time and they know you’ll never turn up develops around that. and i guess a specific area to delve into for a moment on that might be on the advertising side of things, maybe the dichotomy between personalization and does it ever going into exploitation? now, there might be stuff– i know facebook, for example, bans payday loans as best it can. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that’s just a substantive area that it’s like, “all right, we don’t want to do that.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: but when we think about good personalization so that facebook knows i have a dog and not a cat, and a targeter can then offer me dog food and not cat food. how about, if not now, a future day in which an advertising platform can offer to an ad targeter some sense of “i just lost my pet, i’m really upset, i’m ready to make some snap decisions that i might regret later, but when i make them–“ mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: “–i’m going to make them.” so, this is the perfect time to tee up mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –a cubic zirconia or whatever the thing is that– . mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that seems to me a fiduciary approach would say, ideally– how we get there i don’t know, but ideally we wouldn’t permit that kind of approach to somebody using the information we’ve gleaned from them to know they’re in a tough spot– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and then to exploit them. but i don’t know. i don’t know how you would think about something like that. could you write an algorithm to detect something like that? mark zuckerberg: well, i think one of the key principles is that we’re trying to run this company for the long term. and i think that people think that a lot of things that– if you were just trying to optimize the profits for next quarter or something like that, you might want to do things that people might like in the near term, but over the long term will come to resent. but if you actually care about building a community and achieving this mission and building the company for the long term, i think you’re just much more aligned than people often think companies are. and it gets back to the idea before, where i think our self image is largely acting as– in this kind of fiduciary relationship as you’re saying– and across– we could probably go through a lot of different examples. i mean, we don’t want to show people content that they’re going to click on and engage with, but then feel like they wasted their time afterwards. where we don’t want to show them things that they’re going to make a decision based off of that and then regret later. i mean, there’s a hard balance here which is– i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want. so, i think there’s a question between when something is exploitative versus when something is real, but isn’t what you would say that you want. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s a really hard thing to get at. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but on a lot of these cases my experience of running the company is that you start off building a system, you have relatively unsophisticated signals to start, and you build up increasingly complex models over time that try to take into account more of what people care about. and there are all these examples that we can go through. i think probably newsfeed and ads are probably the two most complex ranking examples– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –that we have. but it’s– like we were talking about a second ago, when we started off with the systems, i mean, just start with newsfeeds– but you could do this on ads, too– you know, the most naïve signals, right, are what people click on or what people “like”. but then you just very quickly realize that that doesn’t– it approximates something, but it’s a very crude approximation of the ground truth of what people actually care about. so, what you really want to get to is as much as possible getting real people to look at the real candidates for content and tell you in a multi-dimensional way what matters to them and try to build systems that model that. and then you want to be kind of conservative on preventing downside. so, your example of the payday loans– and when we’ve talked about this in the past, your– you’ve put the question to me of “how do you know when a payday loan is going to be exploitative?” right? “if you’re targeting someone who is in a bad situation?” and our answer is, “well, we don’t really know when it’s going to be exploitative, but we think that the whole category potentially has a massive risk of that, so we just ban it– jonathan zittrain: right. which makes it an easy case. mark zuckerberg: yes. and i think that the harder cases are when there’s significant upside and significant downside and you want to weigh both of them. so, i mean, for example, once we started putting together a really big effort on preventing election interference, one of the initial ideas that came up was “why don’t we just ban all ads that relate to anything that is political?” and they you pretty quickly get into, all right, well, what’s a political ad? the classic legal definition is things that are around elections and candidates, but that’s not actually what russia and other folks were primarily doing. right? it’s– you know, a lot of the issues that we’ve seen are around issue ads, right, and basically sewing division on what are social issues. so, all right, i don’t think you’re going to get in the way of people’s speech and ability to promote and do advocacy on issues that they care about. so, then the question is “all right, well, so, then what’s the right balance?” of how do you make sure that you’re providing the right level of controls, that people who aren’t supposed to be participating in these debates aren’t or that at least you’re providing the right transparency. but i think we’ve veered a little bit from the original questionjonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –but the– but, yeah. so, let’s get back to where you were jonathan zittrain: well, here’s– and this is a way of maybe moving it forward, which is: a platform as complete as facebook is these days offers lots of opportunities to shape what people see and possibly to help them with those nudges, that it’s time to go to the gym or to avoid them from falling into the depredations of the payday loan. and it is a question of so long as the platform to do it, does it now have an ethical obligation to do it, to help people achieve the good life? mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and i worry that it is too great a burden for any company to bear to have to figure out, say, if not the perfect, the most reasonable newsfeed for every one of the– how many? two and a half billion active users? something like that. mark zuckerberg: yeah. on that order. jonathan zittrain: all the time and there might be some ways that start a little bit to get into the engineering of the thing that would say, “okay, with all hindsight, are there ways to architect this so that the stakes aren’t as high, aren’t as focused on just, “gosh, is facebook doing this right?” it’s as if there was only one newspaper in the whole world or one or two, and it’s like, “well, then what the new york times chooses to put on it’s home page, if it were the only newspaper, would have outsize importance.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: so, just as a technical matter, a number of the students in this room had a chance to hear from tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, and he has a new idea for something called “solid”. i don’t know if you’ve heard of solid. it’s a protocol more than it is a product. so, there’s no car to move off the lot today. but its idea is allowing people to have the data that they generate as they motor around the web end up in their own kind of data locker. now, for somebody like tim, it might mean literally in a locker under his desk and he could wake up in the middle of the night and see where his data is. for others, it might mean iraq somewhere, guarded perhaps by a fiduciary who’s looking out for them, the way that we put money in a bank and then we can sleep at night knowing the bankers are– this is maybe not the best analogy in 2019, but watching. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’ll get there. jonathan zittrain: we’ll get there. but solid says if you did that, people would then– or their helpful proxies– be able to say, “all right, facebook is coming along. it wants the following data from me and including that data that it has generated about me as i use it, but stored back in my locker and it kind of has to come back to my well to draw water each time. and that way if i want to switch to schmacebook or something, it’s still in my well and i can just immediately grant permission to schmacebook to see it and i don’t have to do a kind of data slurp and then re-upload it. it’s a fully distributed way of thinking about data. and i’m curious from an engineering perspective does this seem doable with something of the size and the number of spinning wheels that facebook has and does it seem like a mark zuckerberg: yeah– jonathan zittrain: –and i’m curious your reaction to an idea like that. mark zuckerberg: so, i think it’s quite interesting. certainly, the level of computation that facebook is doing and all the services that we’re building is really intense to do in a distributed way. i mean, i think as a basic model i think we’re building out the data center capacity over the next five years and our plan for what we think we need to do that we think is on the order of all of what aws and google cloud are doing for supporting all of their customers. so, okay, so, this is like a relatively computationally intense thing. over time you assume you’ll get more compute. so, decentralized things which are less efficient computationally will be harder– sorry, they’re harder to do computation on, but eventually maybe you have the compute resources to do that. i think the more interesting questions there are not feasibility in the near term, but are the philosophical questions of the goodness of a system like that. so, one question if you want to– so, we can get into decentralization, one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed. jonathan zittrain: “do you want to login with your facebook account?” is the status quo mark zuckerberg: basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice of whether to login to different places and you’re not going through an intermediary, which is kind of like what you’re suggesting here– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –in a sense. okay, now, there’s a lot of things that i think would be quite attractive about that. you know, for developers one of the things that is really troubling about working with our system, or google’s system for that matter, or having your services through apple’s app store, is that you don’t want to have an intermediary between serving your– the people who are using your service and you, right, where someone can just say, “hey, we as a developer have to follow your policy and if we don’t, then you can cut off access to the people we’re serving.” that’s kind of a difficult and troubling position to be in. i think developers– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: –you’re referring to a recent incident. mark zuckerberg: no, well, i was– well, sure<laughter> mark zuckerberg: but i think it underscores the– i think every developer probably feels this: people are using any app store but also login with facebook, with google; any of these services, you want a direct relationship with the people you serve. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: now, okay, but let’s look at the flip side. so, what we saw in the last couple of years with cambridge analytica, was basically an example where people chose to take data that they– some of it was their data, some of it was data that they had seen from their friends, right? because if you want to do things like making it so alternative services can build a competing newsfeed, then you need to be able to make it so that people can bring the data that they see you [ph?] within the system. okay, theybasically, people chose to give their data to a developer who’s affiliated with cambridge university, which is a really respected institution, and then that developer turned around and sold the data to the firm cambridge analytica, which is in violation of our policies. so, we cut off the developers’ access. and, of course, in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution? in some ways it’s a lot easier to regulate and hold accountable large companies like facebook or google, because they’re more visible, they’re more transparent than the long tail of services that people would chose to then go interact with directly. so, i think that this is a really interesting social question. to some degree i think this idea of going in the direction of blockchain authentication is less gated on the technology and capacity to do that. i think if you were doing fully decentralized facebook, that would take massive computation, but i’m sure we could do fully decentralized authentication if we wanted to. i think the real question is do you really want that? jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: right? and i think you’d have more cases where, yes, people would be able to not have an intermediary, but you’d also have more cases of abuse and the recourse would be much harder. jonathan zittrain: yes. what i hear you saying is people as they go about their business online are generating data about themselves that’s quite valuable, if not to themselves, to others who might interact with them. and the more they are empowered, possibly through a distributed system, to decide where that data goes, with whom they want to share it, the more they could be exposed to exploitation. this is a genuine dilemma– mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –because i’m a huge fan of decentralization. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: but i also see the problem. and maybe one answer is there’s some data that’s just so toxic there’s no vessel we should put it in; it might eat a whole through it or something, metaphorically speaking. but, then again, innocuous data can so quickly be assembled into something scary. so, i don’t know if the next election– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: yeah. [ph?] i mean, i think in general we’re talking about the large-scale of data being assembled into meaning something different from what the individual data points mean. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that’s the whole challenge here. but i philosophically agree with you thati mean, i want to think about the– like, i do think about the work that we’re doing as a decentralizing force in the world, right? a lot of the reason why i think people of my generation got into technology is because we believe that technology gives individuals power and isn’t massively centralizing. now you’ve built a bunch of big companies in the process, but i think what has largely happened is that individuals today have more voice, more ability to affiliate with who they want, and stay connected with people, ability to form communities in ways that they couldn’t before, and i think that’s massively empowering to individuals and that’s philosophically kind of the side that i tend to be on. so, that’s why i’m thinking about going back to decentralized or blockchain authentication. that’s why i’m kind of bouncing around how could you potentially make this work, because from my orientation is to try to go in that direction. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: an example where i think we’re generally a lot closer to going in that direction is encryption. i mean, this is, like, one of the really big debates today is basically what are the boundaries on where you would want a messaging service to be encrypted. and there are all these benefits from a privacy and security perspective, but, on the other hand, if what we’re trying to do– one of the big issues that we’re grappling with content governance and where is the line between free expression and, i suppose, privacy on one side, but safety on the other as people do really bad things, right, some of the time. and i think people rightfully have an expectation of us that we’re going to do everything we can to stop terrorists from recruiting people or people from exploiting children or doing different things. and moving in the direction of making these systems more encrypted certainly reduces some of the signals that we would have access to be able to do some of that really important work. but here we are, right, we’re sitting in this position where we’re running whatsapp, which is the largest end-to-end encrypting service in the world; we’re running messenger, which is another one of the largest messaging systems in the world where encryption is an option, but it isn’t the default. i don’t think long term it really makes sense to be running different systems with very different policies on this. i think this is sort of a philosophical question where you want to figure out where you want to be on it. and, so, my question for you– now, i’ll talk about how i’m thinking about this– is all right, if you were in my position and you got to flip a switch is probably too glib, because there’s a lot of work that goes into this, and go in one direction for both of those services, who would you think about that? jonathan zittrain: well, the question you’re putting on the table, which is a hard one is “is it okay,” and let’s just take the simple case, “for two people to communicate with each other in a way that makes it difficult for any third party to casually listen in?” is that okay? and i think that the way we normally answer that question is kind of a form of what you might call status quo-ism, which is not satisfying. it’s whatever has been the case is— mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –whatever has been the case is what should stay the case. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and, so, for whatsapp, it’s like right now whatsapp, as i understand it, you could correct me if i’m wrong, is pretty hard to get into if– mark zuckerberg: it’s fully end-to-end encrypted. jonathan zittrain: right. so, if facebook gets handed a subpoena or a warrant or something from name-your-favorite-country– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and you’re just like, “thank you for playing. we have nothing to–” <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted. jonathan zittrain: yes. and then, on the other hand, and this is not as clean as it could be in theory, but messenger is sometimes encrypted, sometimes not. if it doesn’t happen to have been encrypted by the users, then that subpoena could work and, more than that, there could start to be some automated systems either on facebook’s own initiative or under pressure from governments in the general case, not a specific warrant, to say, “hey, if the following phrases appear, if there’s some telltale that says, “this is somebody going after a kid for exploitation,” it should be forwarded up. if that’s already happening and we can produce x-number of people who have been identified and a number of crimes averted that way, who wants to be the person to be like, “lock it down!” like, “we don’t want any more of that!” but i guess, to put myself now to your question, when i look out over years rather than just weeks or months, the ability to casually peek at any conversation going on between two people or among a small group of people or even to have a machine do it for you, so, you can just set your alert list, you know, crudely speaking, and get stuff back, that– it’s always trite to call something orwellian, but it makes orwell look like a piker. i mean, it seems like a classic case where you– the next sentence would be “what could possible go wrong?” jonathan zittrain: and we can fill that in! and it does mean, though, i think that we have to confront the fact that if we choose to allow that kind of communication, then there’s going to be crimes unsolved that could’ve been solved. there’s going to be crimes not prevented that could have been prevented. and the only thing that kind of blunts it a little is it is not really all or nothing. the modern surveillance states of note in the world, have a lot of arrows in their quivers. and just being able to darken you door and demand surveillance of a certain kind, that might be a first thing they would go to, but they’ve got a plan b, and plan c, and a plan d. and i guess it really gets to what’s your threat model? if you think everybody is kind of a threat, think about the battles of copyright 15 years ago. everybody is a potential infringer. all they have to do is fire up napster, then you’re wanting some massive technical infrastructure to prevent the bad thing. if what you’re thinking is instead, they are a few really bad apples and they tend to– when they congregate online or otherwise with one another– tend to identify themselves and then we might have to send somebody near their house to listen with a cup at the window, metaphorically speaking. that’s a different threat model and [sic] might not need it. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: is that getting to an answer to your question? mark zuckerberg: yeah, and i think i generally agree. i mean, i’ve already said publically that my inclination is to move these services in the direction of being all encrypted, at least the private communication version. i basically think if you want to kind of talk in metaphors, messaging is like people’s living room, right? and i think we– you know, we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations. jonathan zittrain: even as we’re now– i mean, it is 2019, people are happily are putting cameras in their living rooms. mark zuckerberg: that’s their choice, but i guess they’re putting cameras in their living rooms, well, for a number of reasons, but– jonathan zittrain: and facebook has a camera that you can go into your living room- <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that is, i guess– jonathan zittrain: i just want to be clear. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: yeah, although that would be encrypted in this world. jonathan zittrain: encrypted between you and facebook! mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. i think– but it also– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: doesn’t it have like a little alexa functionality, too? mark zuckerberg: well, portal works over messenger. so, if we go towards encryption on messenger, then that’ll be fully encrypted, which i think, frankly, is probably what people want. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: the other model, beside the living room is the town square and that, i think, just has different social norms and different policies and norms that should be at play around that. but i do think that these things are very different. right? you’re not going to– you may end up in a world where the town square is a fully decentralized or fully encrypted thing, but it’s not clear what value there is in encrypting something that’s public content anyway, or very broad. jonathan zittrain: but, now, you were put to it pretty hard in that as i understand it there’s now a change to how whatsapp works, that there’s only five forwards permitted. mark zuckerberg: yeah, so, this is a really interesting point, right? so, when people talk about how encryption will darken some of the signals that we’ll be able to use, you know, both for potentially providing better services and for preventing harm. one of the– i guess, somewhat surprising to me, findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content. jonathan zittrain: so-called meta data. mark zuckerberg: sure. jonathan zittrain: “i don’t know what they’re saying, but here’s who’s they’re calling” kind of thing. mark zuckerberg: yeah, or just like they– this account doesn’t seem to really act like a person, right? and i guess as ai gets more advanced and you build these adversarial networks or generalized adversarial networks, you’ll get to a place where you have ai that can probably more effectively jonathan zittrain: go under mimic [ph?] cover. mimic act like another person– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: –for a while. mark zuckerberg: yeah. but, at the same time, you’ll be building up contrary ai on the other side, but is better at identifying ais that are doing that. but this has certainly been the most effective tactic across a lot of the areas where we’ve needed to focus to preventing harm. you know, the ability to identify fake accounts, which, like, a huge amount of the– under any category of issue that you’re talking about, a lot of the issues downstream come from fake accounts or people who are clearly acting in some malicious or not normal way. you can identify a lot of that without necessarily even looking at the content itself. and if you have to look at a piece of content, then in some cases, you’re already late, because the content exists and the activity has already happened. so, that’s one of the things that makes me feel like encryption for these messaging services is really the right direction to go, because you’re– it’s a very proprivacy and per security move to give people that control and assurance and i’m relatively confident that even though you are losing some tools to– on the finding harmful content side of the ledger, i don’t think at the end of the day that those are going to end up being the most important tools jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –for finding the most of the– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: but now connect it up quickly to the five forwards thing. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, sure. so, that gets down to if you’re not operating on a piece of content directly, you need to operate on patterns of behavior in the network. and what we, basically found was there weren’t that many good uses for people forwarding things more than five times except to basically spam or blast stuff off. it was being disproportionately abused. so, you end up thinking about different tactics when you’re not operating on content specifically; you end up thinking about patterns of usage more. jonathan zittrain: well, spam, i get and that– i’m always in favor of things that reduce spam. however, you could also say the second category was just to spread content. you could have the classic, i don’t know, like les mis, or paul revere’s ride, or arab spring-esque in the romanticized vision of it: “gosh, this is a way for people to do a tree,” and pass along a message that “you can’t stop the signal,” to use a joss whedon reference. you really want to get the word out. this would obviously stop that, too. mark zuckerberg: yeah, and then i think the question is you’re just weighing whether you want this private communication tool where the vast majority of the use and the reason why it was designed was the vast majority of just one-on-one; there’s a large amount of groups that people communicate into, but it’s a pretty small edge case of people operating this with, like– you have a lot of different groups and you’re trying to organize something and almost hack public content-type or public sharing- type utility into an encrypted space and, again, there i think you start getting into “is this the living room or is this the town square?” and when people start trying to use tools that are designed for one thing to get around what i think the social norms are for the town square, that’s when i think you probably start to have some issues. this is not– we’re not done addressing these issues. there’s a lot more to think through on this jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: –but that’s the general shape of the problem that at least i perceive from the work that we’re doing. jonathan zittrain: well, without any particular segue, let’s talk about fake news. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, insert your favorite segue here. there’s some choice or at least some decision that gets made to figure out what’s going to be next in my newsfeed when i scroll up a little more. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and in the last conversation bit, we were talking about how much we’re looking at content versus telltales and metadata, things that surround the content. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for knowing about what that next thing in the newsfeed should be, is it a valid desirable material consideration, do you think, for a platform like facebook to say is the thing we are about to present true, whatever true means? mark zuckerberg: well, yes, because, again, getting at trying to serve people, people tell us that they don’t want fake content. right. i mean, i don’t know anyone who wants fake content. i think the whole issue is, again, who gets to decide. right. so broadly speaking, i don’t know any individual who would sit there and say, “yes, please show me things that you know are false and that are fake.” people want good quality content and information. that said, i don’t really think that people want us to be deciding what is true for them and people disagree on what is true. and, like, truth is, i mean, there are different levels of when someone is telling a story, maybe the meta arc is talking about something that is true but the facts that were used in it are wrong in some nuanced way but, like, it speaks to some deeper experience. well, was that true or not? and do people want that disqualified from to them? i think different people are going to come to different places on this. now, so i’ve been very sensitive, which, on, like, we really want to make sure that we’re showing people high quality content and information. we know that people don’t want false information. so we’re building quite advanced systems to be able to– to make sure that we’re emphasizing and showing stuff that is going to be high quality. but the big question is where do you get the signal on what the quality is? so the kind of initial v.1 of this was working with third party fact checkers. right, i believe very strongly that people do not want facebook and that we should not be the arbiters of truth in deciding what is correct for everyone in the society. i think people already generally think that we have too much power in deciding what content is good. i tend to also be concerned about that and we should talk about some of the governance stuff that we’re working on separately to try to make it so that we can bring more independent oversight into that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but let’s put that in a box for now and just say that with those concerns in mind, i’m definitely not looking to try to take on a lot more in terms of also deciding in addition to enforcing all the content policies, also deciding what is true for everyone in the world. okay, so v.1 of that is we’re going to work with– jonathan zittrain: truth experts. mark zuckerberg: we’re working with fact checkers. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: and, and they’re experts and basically, there’s like a whole field of how you go and assess certain content. they’re accredited. people can disagree with the leaning of some of these organizations. jonathan zittrain: <laughter> who does accredited fact checkers? mark zuckerberg: <laughs> the poynter institute for journalism. jonathan zittrain: i should apply for my certification. mark zuckerberg: you may. jonathan zittrain: okay, good. mark zuckerberg: you’d probably get it, but you have to– you’d have to go through the process. mark zuckerberg: the issue there is there aren’t enough of them, right. so there’s a large content. there’s obviously a lot of information is shared every day and there just aren’t a lot of fact checkers. so then the question is okay, that is probably jonathan zittrain: but the portion– you’re saying the food is good, it’s just the portions are small. but the food is good. mark zuckerberg: i think in general, but so you build systems, which is what we’ve done especially leading up to elections where i think are some of the most fraught times around this where people really are aggressively trying to spread misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: you build systems that prioritize content that seems like it’s going viral because you want to reduce the prevalence of how widespread the stuff gets, so that way the fact checkers have tools to be able to, like, prioritize what they need to go– what they need to go look at. but it’s still getting to a relatively small percent of the content. so i think the real thing that we want to try to get to over time is more of a crowd sourced model where people, it’s not that people are trusting some sort, some basic set of experts who are accredited but are in some kid of lofty institution somewhere else. it’s like do you trust, yeah, like, if you get enough data points from within the community of people reasonably looking at something and assessing it over time, then the question is can you compound that together into something that is a strong enough signal that we can then use that? jonathan zittrain: kind of in the old school like a slash-dot moderating system mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: with only the worry that if the stakes get high enough, somebody wants to astroturf that. mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: i’d be– mark zuckerberg: there are a lot of questions here, which is why i’m not sitting here and announcing a new program. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: but what i’m saying is this is, like,– jonathan zittrain: yeah, mark zuckerberg: this is the general direction that i think we should be thinking about when we haveand i think that there’s a lot of questions and– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and we’d like to run some tests in this area to see whether this can help out. which would be upholding the principles which are that we want to stop– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: the spread of misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: knowing that no one wants misinformation. and the other principle, which is that we do not want to be arbiters of truth. jonathan zittrain: want to be the decider, yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that that’s the basic– those are the basic contours i think of that, of that problem. jonathan zittrain: so let me run an idea by you that you can process in real time and tell me the eight reasons i have not thought of why this is a terrible idea. and that would be people see something in their facebook feed. they’re about to share it out because it’s got a kind of outrage factor to it. i think of the classic story from two years ago in the denver guardian about “fbi agent suspected in hilary clinton email leak implicated in murder-suicide.” i have just uttered fake news. none of that was true if you clicked through the denver guardian. there was just that article. there is denver guardian. if you live in denver, you cannot subscribe. like, it is unambiguously fake. and it was shared more times than the most shared story during the election season of the boston globe. and so mark zuckerberg: so, and this is actually an example, by the way, of where trying to figure out fake accounts is a much simpler solution. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: than trying to down– jonathan zittrain: so if newspaper has one article– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: wait for ten more before you decide they’re a newspaper. mark zuckerberg: yeah. or, you know, i mean, it’s there are any number of systems that you could build to basically detect, “hey, this is–” jonathan zittrain: a potemkin. mark zuckerberg: this is a fraudulent thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and then you can take that down. and again, that ends up being a much less controversial decision because you’re doing it upstream based on the basis of inauthenticity. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: in a system where people are supposed to be their real and represent that they’re their real selves than downstream, trying to say, “hey, is this true or false?” jonathan zittrain: i made a mistake in giving you the easy case. mark zuckerberg: okay. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so i should have not used that example. mark zuckerberg: too simple. jonathan zittrain: you’re right and you knocked that one out of the park and, like, denver guardian, come up with more articles and be real and then come back and talk to us. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, here’s the harder case which is something that might be in an outlet that is, you know, viewed as legitimate, has a number of users, et cetera. so you can’t use the metadata as easily. imagine if somebody as they shared it out could say, “by the way, i want to follow this. i want to learn a little bit more about this.” they click a button that says that. and i also realized when i talked earlier to somebody at facebook on this that adding a new button to the homepage is, like, everybody’s first idea mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah. jonathan zittrain: and it’s– mark zuckerberg: but it’s a reasonable thought experiment, even though it would lead to a very bad ui. jonathan zittrain: fair enough. i understand this is already– mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughs> jonathan zittrain: in the land of fantasy. so they add the button. they say, “i want to follow up on this.” if enough people are clicking comparatively on the same thing to say, “i want to learn more about this. if anything else develops, let me know, facebook,” that, then, if i have my pneumatic tube, it then goes to a convened virtually panel of three librarians. we go to the librarians of the nation and the world at public and private libraries across the land who agree to participate in this program. maybe we set up a little foundation for it that’s endowed permanently and no long connected to whoever endowed it. and those librarians together discuss the piece and they come back with what they would tell a patron if somebody came up to them and said, “i’m about to cite this in my social studies paper. what do you think?” and librarians, like, live for questions like that. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm, yeah. jonathan zittrain: they’re like, “wow. let us tell you.” and they have a huge fiduciary notion of patron duty that says, “i may disapprove of you even studying this, whatever, but i’m here to serve you, the user.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: “and i just think you should know, this is why maybe it’s not such a good source.” and when they come up with that they can send it back and it gets pushed out to everybody who asks for follow-up– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and they can do with it as they will. and last piece of the puzzle, we have high school students who apprentice as librarian number three for credit. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and then they can get graded on how well they participated in this exercise which helps generate a new generation of librarian-themed people who are better off at reading things, so. mark zuckerberg: all right, well, i think you have a side goal here which i haven’t been thinking about on the librarian thing. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: which is the evil goal of promoting libraries. jonathan zittrain: well, it’s mark zuckerberg: no, but i mean, look, i think solving– preventing misinformation or spreading misinformation is hard enough without also trying to develop high school students in a direction. jonathan zittrain: ah. my colleague charlies foote– mark zuckerberg: so, that’s solving a problem with a problem. jonathan zittrain: all right. well, anyway, yes. mark zuckerberg: so i actually think i agree with most of what you have in there. it doesn’t need to be a button on the home page, it can be– i mean, it turns out that there’s so many people using these services that even if you get– even if you put something that looks like it’s not super prominent, like, behind the three dots on a given newsfeed story, you have the options, yeah, you’re not– not everyone is going tois going to like something. jonathan zittrain: if 1 out of 1000 do it, you still get 10,000 or 100,000 people, yeah. mark zuckerberg: you get pretty good signal. but i actually think you could do even better, which is, it’s not even clear that you need that signal. i think that that’s super helpful. i think really what matters is looking at stuff that’s getting a lot of distribution. so, you know, i think that there’s kind of this notion, and i’m going back to the encryption conversation, which is all right, if i say something that’s wrong to you in a one-on-one conversation, i mean, does that need to be fact checked? i mean, it’s, yeah, it would be good if you got the most accurate information. jonathan zittrain: i do have a personal librarian to accompany me for most conversations, yes. there you go. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: well, you are– jonathan zittrain: unusual. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. yes. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that’s the word i was looking for. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i’m not sure i believe you, but yes. mark zuckerberg: it’s– <laughs> but i think that there’s limited– i don’t think anyone would say that every message that goes back and forth in especially an encrypted messaging service should be jonathan zittrain: fact checked. mark zuckerberg: should be fact checked. jonathan zittrain: correct. mark zuckerberg: so i think the real question is all right, when something starts going viral or getting a lot of distribution, that’s when it becomes most socially important for it to be– have some level of validation or at least that we know where that the community in general thinks that this is a reasonable thing. so it’s actually, while it’s helpful to have the signal of whether people are flagging this as something that we should look at, i actually think increasingly you want to be designing systems that just prevent like alarming or sensational content from going viral in the first place. and making sure that that, that the stuff that is getting wide distribution is doing so because it’s high quality on whatever front you care about. so then, okay– jonathan zittrain: and that quality is still generally from poynter or some external party that mark zuckerberg: well, well quality has many dimensions. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but certainly accuracy is one dimension of it. you also, i mean, you pointed out i think in one of your questions, is this piece of content prone to incite outrage. if you don’t mind, i’ll get to your panel of three things in a second, but as a slight detour on this. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: one of the findings that has been quite interesting is, you know, there’s this question about whether social media in general increases, basically makes it so that sensationalist content gets the most distribution. and what we’ve found is that, all right, so we’re going to have rules, right, about what content is allowed. and what we found is that generally within whatever rules you set up, as content approaches the line of what is allowed, it often gets more distribution. so if you’ll have some rule on, you know, what– and take a completely different example and our nudity policies. right. it’s like, okay, you have to define what is unacceptable nudity in some way. as you get as close to that as possible it’s like, all right. like, this is maybe a photo of someone– jonathan zittrain: the skin to share ratio goes up until it gets banned at which point it goes to zero. mark zuckerberg: yes. okay. so that is a bad property of a system, right, that i think you want to generally address. or you don’t want to design a community where or systems for helping to build a community where things that get as close to the line as what is bad get the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so long as we have the premise, which in many cases is true, but i could probably try to think of some where it wouldn’t be true, that as you near the line, you are getting worse. mark zuckerberg: that’s a good point. that’s a good point. there’s– jonathan zittrain: you know, there might be humor that’s really edgy. mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: and that conveys a message that would be impossible to convey without the edginess, while not still– mark zuckerberg: that is– jonathan zittrain: but, i– mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so but then you get the question of what’s the cost benefit of allowing that. and obviously, where you can accurately separate what’s good and bad which you, like in the case of misinformation i’m not sure you could do it fully accurately, but you can try to build systems that approximate that, there’s certainly the issue, which is that, i mean, there is misinformation which leads to massive public harm, right. so if it’s misinformation that is also spreading hate and leading to genocide or public attacks or, it’s like, okay, we’re not going to allow that. right. that’s coming down. but then generally if you say something that’s wrong, we’re not going to try to block that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: we’re just going to try to not show it to people widely because people don’t want content that is wrong. so then the question is as something is approaching the line, how do you assess that? this is a general theme in a lot of the content governance and enforcement work that we’re doing, which is there’s one piece of this which is just making sure that we can as effectively as possible enforce the policies that exist. then there’s a whole other stream of work, which i called borderline content, which is basically this issue of as content approaches the line of being against the policies, how do you make sure that that isn’t the content that is somehow getting the most distribution? and a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that. jonathan zittrain: so this idea would be stuff that you’re kind of letting down easy without banning and letting down easy as it’s going to somehow have a coefficient of friction for sharing that goes up. it’s going to be harder– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for it to go viral. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and– mark zuckerberg: so it’s fascinating because it’s just against– like, you can take almost any category of policy that we have, so i used nudity a second ago. you know, gore and violent imagery. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: hate speech. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: any of these things. i mean, there’s, like, hate speech, there’s content that you would just say is mean or toxic, but that did not violate– but that you would not want to have a society that banned being able to say that thing. but it’s, but you don’t necessarily want that to be the content that is getting the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so here’s a classic transparency question around exactly that system you described. and when you described this, i think you did a post around this a few months ago. this was fascinating. you had graphs in the post depicting this, which was great. how would you feel about sharing back to the person who posted or possibly to everybody who encounters it its coefficient of friction? would that freak people out? would it be, like, all right, i– and in fact, they would then probably start conforming their posts, for better or worse,– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: to try to maximize the sharability. but that rating is already somewhere in there by design. would it be okay to surface it? mark zuckerberg: so, as a principle, i think that that would be good, but i don’t– the way that the systems are designed isn’t that you get a score of how inflammatory or sensationalist a piece of content is. the way that it basically works is you can build classifiers that identify specific types of things. right. so we’re going down the list of, like, all right, there’s 20 categories of harmful content that you’re trying to identify. you know, everything from terrorist propaganda on the one hand to self-harm issues to hate speech and election interference. and basically, each of these things while it uses a lot of the same underlying machine learning infrastructure, you’re doing specific work for each of them. so if you go back to the example on nudity for a second, you know, what you– you’re not necessarily scoring everything on a scale of not at all nude to nude. you[‘re basically enforcing specific policies. so, you know, you’re saying, “okay, if–” jonathan zittrain: so by machine learning it would just be give me an estimate of the odds by which if a human looked at it who was employed to enforce policy– mark zuckerberg: well, basically– jonathan zittrain: whether it violates the policy. mark zuckerberg: and you have a sense of, okay, this is– so what are the things that are adjacent to the policy, right? so you night say, okay, well, if the person is completely naked, that is something that you can definitely build a classifier to be able to identify with relatively high accuracy. but even if they’re not, you know, then the question is you kind of need to be able to qualitatively describe what are the things that are adjacent to that. so maybe the person is wearing a bathing suit and is in a sexually suggestive position. right. it’s not like any piece of content you’re going to score from not at all nude to nude. but you kind of have the cases for what you think are adjacent to the issues and, and again, you ground this and qualitatively, people, like, people might click on it, they might engage with it, but at the end, they don’t necessarily feel good about it. and you want to get at when you’re designing these systems not just what people do, but also you want to make sure we factor in, too, like is this the content that people say that they really want to be seeing? do they–? jonathan zittrain: the constitutional law, there’s a formal kind of definition that’s emerged for the word “prurient.” if something appeals to the prurient interest– mark zuckerberg: okay. jonathan zittrain: as part of a definition of obscenity, the famous miller test, which was not a beeroriented test. and part of a prurient interest is basically it excites me and yet it completely disgusts me. and it sounds like you’re actually converging to the supreme court’s vision of prurience with this. mark zuckerberg: maybe. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and it might be– don’t worry, i’m not trying to nail you down on that. but it’s very interesting that machine learning, which you invoked, is both really good, i gather, at something like this. it’s the kind of thing that’s like just have some people tell me with their expertise, does this come near to violating the policy or not and i’ll just through a spidey sense start to tell you whether it would. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm. jonathan zittrain: rather than being able to throw out exactly what the factors are. i know the person’s fully clothed, but it still is going to invoke that quality. so all of the benefits of machine learning and all of, of course, all the drawbacks where it classifies something and somebody’s like, “wait a minute. that was me doing a parody of blah, blah, blah.” that all comes to the fore. mark zuckerberg: yeah and i mean, when you ask people what they want to see in addition to looking at what they actually engage with, you do get a completely different sense of what people value and you can build systems that approximate that. but going back to your question, i think rather than giving people a score of the friction– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i think you can probably give people feedback of, “hey, this might make people uncomfortable in this way, in this specific way.” and this fits your– jonathan zittrain: it might affect how much it gets– how much it gets shared. mark zuckerberg: yeah. and this gets down to a different– there’s a different ai ethics question which i think is really important here, which is designing ai systems to be understandable by people jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: right and to some degree, you don’t just want it to spit out a score of how offensive or, like, where it scores on any given policy. you want it to be able to map to specific things that might be problematic. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s the way that we’re trying to design the systems overall. jonathan zittrain: yes. now we have something parked in the box we should take out, which is the external review stuff. but before we do, one other just transparency thing maybe to broach. it basically just occurred to me, i imagine it might be possible to issue me a score of how much i’ve earned for facebook this year. it could simply say, “this is how much we collected on the basis of you in particular being exposed to an ad.” <laughs> and i know sometimes people, i guess, might compete to get their numbers up. <laughs> but i’m just curious, would that be a figure? i’d kind of be curious to know, in part because it might even lay the groundwork of being like, “look, mark, i’ll double it. you can have double the money and then don’t show me any ads.” can we get a car off of that lot today? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: <laughs> okay, well, there’s a lot– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: there’s a lot in there. jonathan zittrain: it was a quick question. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> so there’s a question in what you’re saying which is so we built an ad-supported system. should we have an option for people to pay to not see ads. jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: i think is kind of what you’re saying. i mean, just as the basic primer from first principles on this. you know, we’re building this service. we want to give everyone a voice. we want everyone to be able to connect with who they care about. if you’re trying to build a service for everyone, jonathan zittrain: got to be free. that’s just <inaudible 01:04:45> mark zuckerberg: if you want them to use it, that’s just going to be the argument. yes, yes. jonathan zittrain: okay. all right. mark zuckerberg: so then, so this is a kind of a tried and true thing. there are a lot of companies over time that have been ad supported. in general what we find is that if people are going to see ads, they want them to be relevant. they don’t want them to be junk. right. so then within that you give people control over how their data is used to show them ads. but the vast majority of people say, like, show me the most relevant ads that you can because i get that i have to see ads. this is a free service. so now the question is, all right, so there’s a whole set of questions around that that we could get into, but but then jonathan zittrain: for which we did talk about enough to reopen it, the personalization exploitation. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: or even just philosophical question. right now, uber or lyft are not funded that way. we could apply this ad model to uber or lyft, “free rides. totally free. it’s just every fifth ride takes you to wendy’s and idles outside the drive through window.” <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “totally up to you what you want to do, but you’re going to sit here for a while,” and then you go on your way. i don’t know how– and status quo-ism would probably say people would have a problem with that, but it would give people rides that otherwise wouldn’t get rides. mark zuckerberg: i have not thought about that case in their– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: in their business, so, so– jonathan zittrain: well, that’s my patent, damn it, so don’t you steal it. mark zuckerberg: but certainly some services, i think tend themselves better towards being ad supported than others. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: okay and i think generally information-based ones tend to– jonathan zittrain: than my false imprisonment hypo, i’d– okay, fair enough. mark zuckerberg: i mean, that seems jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: there might be, you know, more– <laughs> more issues there. but okay, but go to the subscription thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: when people have questions about the ad model on facebook, i don’t think the questions are just about the ad model, i think they’re about both seeing ads and data use around ads. and the thing that i think, so when i think about this it’s, i don’t just think you want to let people pay to not see ads because i actually think then the question is the questions are around ads and data use and i don’t think people are going to be that psyched about not seeing ads but then not having different controls over how their data is used. okay, but now you start getting into a principle question which is are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people. and my answer to that is a hard no, right. so the prerequisite– jonathan zittrain: what’s an example of data use that isn’t ad-based, just so we know what we’re talking about? mark zuckerberg: that isn’t ad-based? jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: like what do you mean? jonathan zittrain: you were saying, i don’t want to see ads. but you’re saying that’s kind of just the wax on the car. what’s underneath is how the data gets used. mark zuckerberg: so, well, look– maybe– let me keep going with this explanation and then i think this’ll be clear. jonathan zittrain: yeah, sure. mark zuckerberg: so one of the things that we’ve been working on is this tool that we call clear history. and the basic idea is it is you can kind of analogize it to a web browser where you can clear your cookies. that’s kind of a normal thing. you know that when you clear your cookies you’re going to get logged out of a bunch of stuff. a bunch of stuff might get more annoying. jonathan zittrain: which is why my guess is, am i right, probably nobody clears their cookies. mark zuckerberg: i don’t know. jonathan zittrain: they might use incognito mode or something, but. mark zuckerberg: i think– i don’t know. how many of you guys clear your cookies every once in a while, right? jonathan zittrain: this is not a representative group, damn it. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. like, maybe once a year or something i’ll clear my cookies. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but no, it’s, i think– jonathan zittrain: happy new year. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, over some period of time, all right, but– jonathan zittrain: yeah, okay. mark zuckerberg: but not necessarily every day. but it’s important that people have that tool even though it might in a local sense make their experience worse. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: okay. so that kind of content of what different services, websites and apps send to facebook that, you know, we use to help measure the ads in effectiveness there, right, so things like, you know, if you’re an app developer and you’re trying to pay for ads to help grow your app, we want to only charge you when we actually, when something that we show leads to an install, not just whether someone sees the ad or clicks on it, but if they add– jonathan zittrain: that requires a whole infrastructure to, yeah. mark zuckerberg: okay, so then, yeah, so you build that out. it helps us show people more relevant ads. it can help show more relevant content. often a lot of these signals are super useful also on the security side for some of the other things that we’ve talked about, so that ends up being important. but fundamentally, you know, looking at the model today, it seems like you should have something like this ability to clear history. it turns out that it’s a much more complex technical project. i’d talked about this at our developer conference last year, about how i’d hoped that we’d roll it out by the end of 2018 and just, the plumbing goes so deep into all the different systems that it’s, that– but we’re still working on it and we’re going to do it. it’s just it’s taking a little bit longer. jonathan zittrain: so clear history basically means i am as if a newb, i just show mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: even though i’ve been using facebook for a while, it’s as if it knows nothing about me and it starts accreting again. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i’m just trying to think just as a plain old citizen, how would i make an informed judgment about how often to do that or when i should do it? what–? mark zuckerberg: well, hold on. let’s go to that in a second. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: but one thing, just to connect the dots on the last conversation. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. right. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay. right. that’s going to, if we’re going to give controls over data use, we’re going to do that for everyone in the community. so that’s the first thing that i think we need to go do. mark zuckerberg: so that’s, so that’s kind of– this is sort of the how we’re thinking about the projects and this is a really deep and big technical project but we’re committed to doing it because i think it’s that’s what it’s there for. [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: and i guess like an ad block or somebody could then write a little script for your browser that would just clear your history every time you visit or something. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, no, but the plan would also be to offer something that’s an ongoing thing. jonathan zittrain: i see. mark zuckerberg: in your browser, but i think the analogy here is you kind of have, in your browser you have the ability to clear your cookies. and then, like, in some other place you have under your, like, nuclear settings, like, don’t ever accept any cookies in my browser. and it’s like, all right, your browser’s not really going to work that well. jonathan zittrain: yeah. <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but, but you can do that if you want because you should have that control. i think that these are part and parcel, right. it’s i think a lot of people might go and clear their history on a periodic basis because they– or, or actually in the research that we’ve done on this as we’ve been developing it, the real thing that people have told us that they want is similar to cookie management, not necessarily wiping everything, because that ends in inconvenience of getting logged out of a bunch of things, but there are just certain services or apps that you don’t want that data to be connected to your facebook account. so having the ability on an ad hoc basis to go through and say, “hey, stop associating this thing,” is going to end up being a quite important thing that i think we want to try to deliver. so that’s, this is partially as we’re getting into this, it’s a more complex thing but i think it’s very valuable. and i think if any conversation around the– around subscriptions, i think you would want to start with giving people these, make sure that everyone has these kind of controls. so that’s, we’re kind of in the early phases of doing that. the philosophical downstream question of whether you also let people pay to not have ads, i don’t know. there were a bunch of questions around whether that’s actually a good thing, but i personally don’t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads. that all of the research that we have, it’s it may still end up being the right thing to offer that as a choice down the line, but all of the data that i’ve seen suggests that the vast, vast, vast majority of people want a free service and that the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: people like being able to get information from local businesses and things like that too, so. so there’s a lot of good there. jonathan zittrain: yeah. forty years ago it would have been the question of abc versus hbo and the answer turned out to be yes. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so you’re right. and people might have different things. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: there’s a little paradox lingering in there about if something’s so important and vital that we wouldn’t want to deprive anybody of access to it but therefore nobody gets it until we figured out how to remove it for everybody. mark zuckerberg: what we– [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: in other words, if i could buy my way out of ads and data collection it wouldn’t be fair to those who can’t and therefore we all subsist with it until the advances you’re talking about. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i guess what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle. it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong. so that to me is something that in any conversation about whether we’d evolve towards having a subscription service, i think you have to have these controls first and it’s a very deep thing. a technical problem to go do, but we’re– that’s why we’re working through that. jonathan zittrain: yes. so long as the privacy controls that we’re not able to buy our way into aren’t controls that people ought to have. you know, it’s just the kind of underlying question of is the system as it is that we can’t opt out of a fair system. and that’s of course, you know, you have to go into the details to figure out what you mean by it. but let’s in the remaining time we have left mark zuckerberg: how are we doing on time? jonathan zittrain: we’re good. we’re 76 minutes in. mark zuckerberg: all right, into– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’re going to get through maybe half the topics. jonathan zittrain: yeah, yeah, yeah. mark zuckerberg: and i’ll come back and do another one later. jonathan zittrain: i’m going to bring this in for a landing soon. on my agenda left includes such things as taking out of the box the independent review stuff, chat a little bit about that. i’d be curious, and this might be a nice thing, really, as we wrap up, which would be a sense of any vision you have for what would facebook look like in 10 or 15 years and how different would it be than the facebook of 10 years ago is compared to today. so that’s something i’d want to talk about. is there anything big on your list that you want to make sure we talk about? mark zuckerberg: those are good. those are good topics. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> fair enough. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> jonathan zittrain: so all right, the external review board. mark zuckerberg: yeah. so one of the big questions that i have just been thinking about is, you know, we make a lot of decisions around content enforcement and what stays up and what comes down. and having gone through this process over the last few years of working on the systems, one of the themes that i feel really strongly about is that we shouldn’t be making so many of these decisions ourselves. you know, one of the ways that i try to reason about this stuff is take myself out of the position of being ceo of the company, almost like a rawlsian perspective. if i was a different person, what would i want the ceo of the company to be able to do? and i would not want so many decisions about content to be concentrated with any individual. so– jonathan zittrain: it is weird to see big impactful, to use a terrible word, decisions about what a huge swath of humanity does or doesn’t see inevitably handled as, like, a customer service issue. it does feel like a mismatch, which is what i hear you saying. mark zuckerberg: so let’s, yeah, so i actually think the customer service analogy is a really interesting one. right. so when you email amazon, because they don’t, they make a mistake with your package, that’s customer support. right. i mean, they are trying to provide a service and generally, they can invest more in customer support and make people happier. we’re doing something completely different, right. when someone emails us with an issue or flags some content, they’re basically complaining about something that someone else in the community did. so it’s more like it’s almost more like a court system in that sense. doing more of that does not make people happy because in every one of those transactions one person ends up the winner and one is the loser. either you said that that content, that the content was fine, in which case the person complaining is upset, or you the someone’s content down, in which case the person is really upset because you’re now telling them that they don’t have the ability to express something that they feel is a valid thing that they should be able to express. so in some deep sense while some amount of what we do is customer support, people get locked out of their account, et cetera, you know, we now have, like, more than 30,000 people working on content review and safety review, doing the kind of judgments that, you know, it’s basically a lot of the stuff, we have machine learning systems that flag things that could be problematic in addition to people in the community flagging things, but making these assessments of whether the stuff is right or not. so one of the questions that i just think about, it’s like, okay, well, you have many people doing this. regardless of how much training they have, we’re going to make mistakes, right. so you want to start building in principles around, you know, what you would kind of think of as due process, right. so we’re building in an ability to have an appeal, right, which already is quite good in that we are able to overturn a bunch of mistakes that the first line people make in making these assessments. but at some level i think you also want a level of kind of independent appeal, right, where if, okay, let’s say, so the appeals go to maybe a higher level of facebook employee who is a little more trained in the nuances of the policies; but at some point, i think you also need an appeal to an independent groups, which is, like, is this policy fair? was this–? like is this piece of content really getting on the wrong side of the balance of free expression and safety? and i just don’t think at the end of the day that that’s something that you want centralized in a single company. so now the question is how do you design that system and that’s a real question, right, so that we don’t pretend to have the answers on this. what we’re basically working through is we have a draft proposal and we’re working with a lot of experts around the world to run a few pilots in the first half of this year that can hopefully we can codify into something that’s a longer term thing. but i just, i believe that this is just an incredibly important thing. as a person and if i take aside the role that i have as ceo of the company, i do not want the company being able to make all of those final decisions without a check and balance and accountability, so i want to use the position that i’m in to help build that kind of an institution. jonathan zittrain: yes. and when we talk about an appeal, then, it sounds like you could appeal two distinct things. one is this was the rule but it was applied wrong to me. this, in fact, was parody [ph?] so it shouldn’t be seen as near the line. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i want the independent body to look at that. the other would be the rule is wrong. the rule should change because– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and you’re thinking the independent body could weigh in on both of those? mark zuckerberg: yeah. over time, i would like the role of the independent oversight board to be able to expand to do additional things as well. i think the question is it’s hard enough to even set something up that’s going to codify the values that we have around expression and safety on a relatively defined topic. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so i think the question is if you kind of view this as an experiment in institution building where we’re trying to build this thing that is going to have real power tojonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i mean, like, i will not be able to make a decision that overturns what they say. which i think is good. i think also just it raises the stakes. you need to make sure we get this right, so. jonathan zittrain: it’s fascinating. it’s huge. i think the way you’re describing it, i wouldn’t want to understate– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: that this is not a usual way of doing business. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i think it– i think this is– i really care about getting this right. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but i think you want to start with something that’s relatively well-defined and then hopefully expand it to be able to cover more things over time. so in the beginning i think one question that could come up is my understanding, i mean, it’s always dangerous talking about legal precedence when i’m, this might be one of my first times at harvard law school. i did not spend a lot of time here<laughter> mark zuckerberg: when i was an undergrad. but, you know what i mean, the, if the supreme court overturns something, they don’t tell congress what the law should be, they just say there’s an issue here, right. and then basically there’s a process. all right. so if i’m getting that wrong<laughter> mark zuckerberg: all right. i shouldn’t have done that. jonathan zittrain: no, no. that’s quite honest. [ph?] mark zuckerberg: i knew that was dangerous. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: and that that was a mistake. jonathan zittrain: there are people who do agree with you. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. oh, so that’s an open question that that’s how it works. jonathan zittrain: it’s a highly debated question, yes. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: there’s the i’m just the umpire calling balls and strikes and in fact, the first type of question we brought up, which was, “hey, we get this is the standard. does it apply here?” lends itself a little more to, you know, you get three swings and if you miss them all, like, you can’t keep playing. the umpire can usher you away from the home plate. this is, i’m really digging deep into my knowledge now of baseball. there’s another thing about, like,– mark zuckerberg: that’s okay. i’m not the person who’s going to call you out on getting something wrong there. jonathan zittrain: i appreciate that. mark zuckerberg: that’s why i also need to have a librarian next to me at all times. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: very good. i wonder how much librarians tend to know about baseball. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: aww. jonathan zittrain: but we digress. ah, we’re going to get letters, mentions. mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: but whether or not the game is actually any good with a three strikes rule, maybe there should be two or four or whatever, starts to ask of the umpire more than just, you know, your best sense of how that play just went. both may be something. both are surely beyond standard customer service issues, so both could maybe be usefully externalized. what you’d ask the board to do in the category one kind of stuff maybe it’s true that, like, professional umpirage [ph?] could help us and there are people who are jurists who can do that worldwide. for the other, whether it’s the supreme jonathan zittrain: –court, or the so-called common law and state courts where often a state supreme court will be like, “henceforth, 50 feet needs to be the height of a baseball net,” and like, “if you don’t agree, legislature, we’ll hear from you, but until then it’s 50 feet.” they really do kind of get into the weeds. they derive maybe some legitimacy for decisions like that from being close to their communities, and it really regresses them to a question of: is facebook a global community, a community of 2.x billion people worldwide, transcending any national boundaries, and for which i think so far on these issues, it’s meant to be, “the rule is the rule,” it doesn’t really change in terms of service from one place to anotherversus how much do we think of it as somehow localized– whether or not localized through governmentbut where different local communities make their own judgments? mark zuckerberg: that is one of the big questions. i mean, right now we have community standards that are global. we follow local laws, as you say. but i think the idea is– i don’t think we want to end up in a place where we have very different norms in different places, but you want to have some sense of representation and making sure that the body that can deliberate on this has a good diversity of views. so these are a lot of the things that we’re trying to figure out, is like: well, how big is the body? when decisions are made, are they made by the whole body, or do you have panels of people that are smaller sets? if there are panels, how do you make sure that you’re not just getting a random sample that kind of skews in the values perspective towards one thing? so then there a bunch of mechanisms like, okay, maybe one panel that’s randomly constituted decides on whether the board will take up a question or one of the issues, but then a separate random panel of the group actually does the decisions, so that way you eliminate some risk that any given panel is going to be too ideologically skewed. so there’s a bunch of things that i think we need to think through and work through, but the goal on this is to, over time, have it grow into something that can provide greater accountability and oversight to potentially more of the hard questions that we face, but i think it’s so high-stakes that starting with something that’s relatively defined is going to be the right way to go in the beginning. so regardless of the fact that i was unaware of the controversy around the legal point that i made a second ago, i do think in our case it makes sense to start with not having this group say what the policies are going to be, but just have there be– have it be able to say, “hey, we think that you guys are on the wrong side on this, and maybe you should rethink where the policy is because we think you’re on the wrong side.” there’s one other thing that i think is worth calling out, which is in a typical kind of judicial analog, or at least here in the u.s., my understanding, is there’s the kind of appeal route to the independent board considering an issue, but i also think that we want to have an avenue where we as the company can also just raise hard issues that come up to the board without having– which i don’t actually know if there’s any mechanism for that. jonathan zittrain: it’s called an advisory opinion. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: but under u.s. federal law, it’s not allowed because of article iii case or controversy requirement, but state courts do it all the time. you’ll have a federal court sometimes say– because it’s a federal court but it’s deciding something under state law. it’ll be like, “i don’t know, ask florida.” and they’ll be like, “hey florida,” and then florida is just florida. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: sure. so i think that– jonathan zittrain: so you can do an advisory opinion. mark zuckerberg: –that’ll end up being an important part of this too. we’re never going to be able to get out of the business of making frontline judgments. we’ll have the ai systems flag content that they think is against policies or could be, and then we’ll have people– this set of 30 thousand people, which is growing– that is trained to basically understand what the policies are. we have to make the frontline decisions, because a lot of this stuff needs to get handled in a timely way, and a more deliberative process that’s thinking about the fairness and the policies overall should happen over a different timeframe than what is often relevant, which is the enforcement of the initial policy. but i do think overall for a lot of the biggest questions, i just want to build a more independent process. jonathan zittrain: well, as you say, it’s an area with fractal complexity in the best of ways, and it really is terra incognito, and it’d be exciting to see how it might be built out. i imagine there’s a number of law professors around the world, including some who come from civil rather than common law jurisdictions, who are like, “this is how it works over here,” from which you could draw. another lingering question would be– lawyers often have a bad reputation. i have no idea why. but they often are the glue for a system like this so that a judge does not have to be oracular or omniscient. there’s a process where the lawyer for one side does a ton of work and looks at prior decisions of this board and says, “well, this is what would be consistent,” and the other lawyer comes back, and then the judge just gets to decide between the two, rather than having to just know everything. there’s a huge tradeoff here for every appealed content decision, how much do we want to build it into a case, and you need experts to help the parties, versus they each just sort of come before solomon and say, “this kind of happened,” and– or judge judy maybe is a more contemporary reference. mark zuckerberg: somewhere between the two, yeah. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: yeah. so it’s a lot of stuff– and for me, i both find myself– i don’t know if this is the definition of prurient– both excited by it and somewhat terrified by it, but very much saying that it’s better than a status quo, which is where i think you and i are completely agreeing, and maybe a model for other firms out there. so that’s the last question in this area that pops to my mind, which is: what part of what you’re developing at facebook– a lot of which is really resource-intensive– is best thought of as a public good to be shared, including among basically competitors, versus, “that’s part of our comparative advantage and our secret sauce”? if you develop a particularly good algorithm that can really well detect fake news or spammers or bad actors– you’ve got the phds, you’ve got the processors– is that like, “in your face, schmitter [ph?],” or is like, “we should have somebody that– some body– that can help democratize that advance”? and it could be the same to be said for these content decisions. how do you think about that? mark zuckerberg: yeah, so certainly the threat-sharing and security work that you just referenced is a good area where there’s much better collaboration now than there was historically. i think that that’s just because everyone recognizes that it’s such a more important issue. and by the way, there’s much better collaboration with governments now too on this, and not just our own here in the u.s., and law enforcement, but around the world with election commissions and law enforcement, because there’s just a broad awareness that these are issues and that– jonathan zittrain: especially if you have state actors in the mix as the adversary. mark zuckerberg: yes. so that’s certainly an area where there’s much better collaboration now, and that’s good. there’s still issues. for example, if you’re law enforcement or intelligence and you have developed a– “source” is not the right word– but basically if you’ve identified someone as a source of signals that you can watch and learn about, then you may not want to come to us and tell us, “hey, we’ve identified that this state actor is doing this bad thing,” because then the natural thing that we’re going to want to do is make sure that they’re not on our system doing bad things, or that they’re not– either they’re not in the system at all or that we’re interfering with the bad things that they’re trying to do. so there’s some mismatch of incentives, but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, “hey, this is what we’re at.” so i just think having that kind of baseline where you build that up over time is helpful. and i think on security and safety is probably the biggest area of that kind of collaboration now, across all the different types of threats; not just election and democratic process type stuff, but any kind of safety issue. the other area where i tend to think about what we’re doing is– it should be open– is just technical infrastructure overall. i mean, that is probably a less controversial piece, but we open-source a lot of the basic stuff that runs our systems, and i think that that is a– that’s a contribution that i’m quite proud of that we do. we have sort of pioneered this way of thinking about how people connect, and the data model around that is more of a graph, and the idea of graph database and a lot of the infrastructure for being able to efficiently access that kind of content i think is broadly applicable beyond the context of a social network. when i was here as an undergrad, even though i wasn’t here for very long, i studied psychology and computer science, and to me– i mean, my grounding philosophy on this stuff is that basically people should be at the center of more of the technology that we build. i mean, one of the early things that i kind of recognized when i was a student was like– at the time, there were internet sites for finding almost anything you cared about, whether it’s books or music or news or information or businesses– but as people, we think about the world primarily in terms of other people, not in terms of other objects, not cutting things up in terms of content or commerce or politics or different things, but it’s like– the stuff should be organized around the connections that people have, where people are at the centerpiece of that, and one of the missions that i care about is over time just pushing more technology development in the tech industry overall to develop things with that mindset. i think– and this is a little bit of a tangentbut the way that our phones work today, and all computing systems, organized around apps and tasks is fundamentally not how people– how our brains work and how we approach the world. it’s not– so that’s one of the reasons why i’m just very excited longer-term about especially things like augmented reality, because it’ll give us a platform that i think actually is how we think about stuff. we’ll be able to bring the computational objects into the world but fundamentally we’ll be interacting as people around them. the whole thing won’t be organized around an app or a task; it’ll be organized around people, and that i think is a much more natural and human system for how our technology should be organized. so opensourcing all of that infrastructure– to do that, and enabling not just us but other companies to kind of get that mindset into more of their thinking and the technical underpinning of that, is just something that i care really deeply about. jonathan zittrain: well, this is nice, and this is bringing us in for our landing, because we’re talking about 10, 20, 30 years ahead. as a term of art, i understand augmented reality to mean, “i’ve got a visor”version 0.1 was google glass– something where i’m kind of out in the world but i’m literally online at the same time because there’s data coming at me in some– that’s what you’re talking about, correct? mark zuckerberg: yeah, although it really should be glasses like what you have. i think we’ll probablymaybe they’ll have to be a little bigger, but not too much bigger or else it would start to get weird. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: so i don’t think a visor is going to catch. i don’t think anyone is psyched about that feature. jonathan zittrain: and anything involving surgery starts to sound a little bad too. mark zuckerberg: no, no, we’re definitely focused on– <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: –on external things. although– jonathan zittrain: like, “don’t make news, don’t make news, don’t make news.” <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. although we have showed this demo of basically can someone type by thinking, and of course when you’re talking about brain-computer interfaces, there’s two dimensions of that work. there’s the external stuff, and there’s the internal stuff, and invasive, and yes, of course if you’re actually trying to build things that everyone is going to use, you’re going to want to focus on the noninvasive things. jonathan zittrain: yes. can you type by thinking? mark zuckerberg: you can. jonathan zittrain: it’s called a ouija board. no. but you’re subvocalizing enough or there’s enough of a read of– mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. so there’s actually a bunch of the research here– there’s a question of throughput and how quickly can you type and how many bits can you express efficiently, but the basic foundation for the research is someone– a bunch of folks who are doing this research showed a bunch of people images– i think it was animals– so, “here’s an elephant, here’s a giraffe”– while having kind of a net on their head, noninvasive, but shining light and therefore looking at the level of blood activity andjust blood flow and activity in the brain– trained a machine learning basically on what the pattern of that imagery looked like when the person was looking at different animals, then told the person to think about an animal, right? so think about– just pick one of the animals to think about, and can predict what the person was thinking about in broad strokes just based on matching the neural activity. so the question is, so you can use that to type. jonathan zittrain: fifth amendment implications are staggering. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: sorry. mark zuckerberg: well, yes. i mean, presumably this would be something that someone would choose to use a product. i’m not– yeah, yeah. i mean, yes, there’s of course all the other implications, but yeah, i think that this is going to be– that’s going to be an interesting thing down the line. jonathan zittrain: but basically your vision then for a future– mark zuckerberg: i don’t know how we got onto that. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: you can’t blame me. i think you brought this up. mark zuckerberg: i did, but of all the things that– i mean, this is exciting, but we haven’t even covered yet how we should talk about– tech regulation and all this stuff i figured we’d get into. i mean, we’ll be here for like six or seven hours. i don’t know how many days you want to spend here to talking about this, but– jonathan zittrain: “we’re here at the zuckerberg center and hostage crisis.” <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: “the building is surrounded.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. but i think a little bit on future tech and research is interesting too, so. jonathan zittrain: please. mark zuckerberg: yeah, we’re good. jonathan zittrain: oh, we did cover it, is what you’re saying. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: i mean, but going back to your question about what– if this is the last topic– what i’m excited about for the next 10 or 20 years– i do think over the long term, reshaping our computing platforms to be fundamentally more about people and how we process the world is a really fundamental thing. over the nearer term– so call it five years– i think the clear trend is towards more private communication. if you look at all of the different ways that people want to share and communicate across the internet– but we have a good sense of the cross-strength, everything from one-on-one messages to kind of broadcasting publicly– the thing that is growing the fastest is private communication. right? so between whatsapp and messenger, and instagram now, just the number of private messages– it’s about 100 billion a day through those systems alone, growing very quickly, growing much faster than the amount that people want to share or broadcast into a feed-type system. of the type of broadcast content that people are doing, the thing that is growing by far the fastest is stories. right? so ephemeral sharing of, “i’m going to put this out, but i want to have a timeframe after which the data goes away.” so i think that that just gives you a sense of where the hub of social activity is going. it also is how we think about the strategy of the company. i mean, people– when we talk about privacy, i think a lot of the questions are often about privacy policies and legal or policy-type things, and privacy as a thing not to be breached, and making sure that you’re within the balance of what is good. but i actually think that there’s a much more– there’s another element of this that’s really fundamental, which is that people want tools that give them new contexts to communicate, and that’s also fundamentally about giving people power through privacy, not just not violating privacy, right? so not violating privacy is a backstop, but actually– you can kind of think about all the success that facebook has had– this is kind of a counterintuitive thing– has been because we’ve given people new private or semi-private ways to communicate things that they wouldn’t have had before. so thinking about facebook as an innovator in privacy is certainly not the mainstream view, but going back to the very first thing that we did, making it so harvard students could communicate in a way that they had some confidence that their content and information would be shared with only people within that community, there was no way that people had to communicate stuff at that scale, but not have it either be completely public or with just a small set of people before. and people’s desire to be understood and express themselves and be able to communicate with all different kinds of groups is, in the experience that i’ve had, nearly unbounded, and if you can give people new ways to be able to communicate safely and express themselves, then that is something that people just have a deep thirst and desire for. so encryption is really important, because i mean, we take for granted in the u.s. that there’s good rule of law, and that the government isn’t too much in our business, but in a lot of places around the world, especially where whatsapp is the biggest, people can’t take that for granted. so having it so that you really have confidence that you’re sharing something one-on-one and it’s not– and it really is one-on-one, it’s not one-on-one and the government there– actually makes it so people can share things that they wouldn’t be comfortable otherwise doing it. that’s power that you’re giving people through building privacy innovations. stories i just think is another example of this, where there are a lot of things that people don’t want as part of the permanent record but want to express, and it’s not an accident that that is becoming the primary way that people want to share with all of their friends, not putting something in a feed that goes on their permanent record. there will always be a use for that too– people want to have a record and there’s a lot of value that you can build around that– you can have longer-term discussions– it’s harder to do that around stories. there’s different value for these things. but over the next five years, i think we’re going to see all of social networking kind of be reconstituted around this base of private communication, and that’s something that i’m just very excited about. i think that that’s– it’s going to unlock a lot of people’s ability to express themselves and communicate things that they haven’t had the tools to do before, and it’s going to be the foundation for building a lot of really important tools on top of that too. jonathan zittrain: that’s so interesting to me. i would not have predicted that direction for the next five years. i would have figured, “gosh, if you already know with whom you want to speak, there are so many tools to speak with them,” some of which are end-to-end, some of which aren’t, some of which are rollyourown and open-source, and there’s always a way to try to make that easier and better, but that feels a little bit to me like a kind of crowded space, not yet knowing of the innovations that might lie ahead and means of communicating with the people you already know you want to talk to. and for that, as you say, if that’s where it’s at, you’re right that encryption is going to be a big question, and otherwise technical design so that if the law comes knocking on the door, what would the company be in a position to say. this is the apple iphone cupertino– sorry, san bernardino case– and it also calls to mind will there be peer-to-peer implementations of the things you’re thinking about that might not even need the server at all, and it’s basically just an app that people use, and if it’s going to deliver an ad, it can still do that appside, and how much governments will abide it. they have not, for the most part, demanded technology mandates to reshape how the technology works. they’re just saying, “if you’ve got it”– in part you’ve got it because you want to serve ads– “we want it.” but if you don’t even have it, it’s been rare for the governments to say, “well, you’ve got to build your system to do it.” it did happen with the telephone system back in the day. calea, the communications assistance to law enforcement act, did have federal law in the united states saying, “if you’re in the business of building a phone network, at&t, you’ve got to make it so we can plug in as you go digital,” and we haven’t yet seen those mandates in the internet software side so much. so we can see that coming up again. but it’s so funny, because if you’d asked me, i would have figured it’s encountering people you haven’t met before and interacting with them, for which all of the stuff about air traffic control of what goes into your feed and how much your stuff gets shared– all of those issues start to rise to the fore, and it gets me thinking about, “i ought to be able to make a feed recipe that’s my recipe, and fills it according to facebook variables, but i get to say what the variables are.” but i could see that if you’re just thinking about people communicating with the people they already know and like, that is a very different realm. mark zuckerberg: it’s not necessarily– it’s not just the people that you already know. i do think– we’ve really focused on friends and family for the last 10 or 15 years, and i think a big part of what we’re going to focus on now is around building communities in different ways and all the utility that you can build on top of, once you have a network like this in place. so everything from how people can do commerce better to things like dating, which is– a lot of dating happens on our services, but we haven’t built any tools specifically for that. jonathan zittrain: i do remember the facebook joint experiment– “experiment” is such a terrible wordstudy, by which one could predict when two facebook members are going to declare themselves in a relationship, months ahead of the actual declaration. i was thinking some of the ancillary products were in-laws. mark zuckerberg: that was very early. yeah. so you’re right that a lot of this is going to be about utility that you can build on top of it, but a lot of these things are fundamentally private, right? so if you’re thinking about commerce, that people have a higher expectation for privacy, and the question is: is the right context for that going to be around an app like facebook, which is broad, or an app like instagram? i think part of it is– the discovery part of it, i think we’ll be very well served there– but then we’ll also transition to something that people want to be more private and secure. anyhow, we could probably go on for many hours on this, but maybe we should save this for the round 2 of this that we’ll do in the future. jonathan zittrain: indeed. so thanks so much for coming out, for talking at such length, for covering such a kaleidoscopic range of topics, and we look forward to the next time we see you. mark zuckerberg: yeah. thanks. jonathan

"google is shutting down its emmy award-winning vr film division, spotlight stories, after six years of building out content, variety reports. we’ve reached out to google for confirmation. update: a google spokesperson responded to techcrunch with a statement confirming the shutdown. “since its inception, spotlight stories strove to re-imagine vr storytelling. from ambitious shorts like son of jaguar, sonaria and back to the moon to critical acclaim for pearl (emmy winner and first-ever vr film nominated for an oscar) the spotlight stories team left a lasting impact on immersive storytelling. we are proud of the work the team has done over the years.” “google spotlight stories means storytelling for vr. we are artists and technologists making immersive stories for mobile 360, mobile vr and room-scale vr headsets, and building the innovative tech that makes it possible,” the group’s site reads. the spotlight stories team was part of the company’s advanced technologies and products (atap) group. much like facebook’s ill-fated oculus story studio, there was never a big focus on monetizing what was being created internally. the studio’s best-received work, “pearl,” was nominated for an academy award and won an emmy in 2017. the group also worked with wes anderson to bring a vr behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of his film “isle of dogs.” in november, the group released its last major work, “age of sail,” a narrative film that could be watched on mobile and high-end vr systems. google has made significant investments in ar and vr, but has allowed competitors like facebook and apple to surpass their consumer efforts. google’s efforts on its vr program went full throttle in 2016 and early 2017 while the company sought to keep pace with samsung, which was aggressively hocking mobile hardware it had built alongside oculus. it’s rumored the company made significant changes to its immersive divisions after apple introduced arkit in mid-2017, aggressively shifting resources from its vr division to ar projects like its arcore mobile augmented reality platform. the company has not updated its daydream view vr headset since 2017; it has ceded most of its ground to oculus as it allowed products like lenovo’s daydream view to die on the shelf as it failed to make updates to its platform or direct significant resources to bringing new content on board. now, with the reported shutdown of spotlight stories, the company is making it clear it doesn’t think building their own content is the right approach either."
"andreessen horowitz, a venture capital fund behind the likes of facebook, instagram and groupon, has tapped david george as its newest general partner and its first top dealmaker focused on late-stage deals. george joins from general atlantic, where he’d backed consumer internet, enterprise software and fintech startups as a principal since 2012. “andreessen has always been a multi-stage investment firm, but really the opportunity here is for [me] to be the first focused late-stage investor there and to work with the early-stage team and complement their experience,” george told techcrunch. a16z’s newest general partner david george at a16z, george will invest across industries, offering up his knowledge of late-stage economics, valuations and underwriting to a16z’s large team of investors. george is the firm’s 15th general partner and at least the fourth high-level addition to the team in the last year, including katie haun, who joined in june to lead a16z’s cryptocurrency investment effort. angela strange and connie chan, additionally, were promoted to gp last summer. the firm’s swelling team is amongst the largest of any vc firm. most partnerships consist of one to three top dealmakers and a few partners or principals. a16z breaks the mold with its ever-expanding team of gps. managing director scott kupor says this is part of the firm’s strategy of attacking every industry head-on. “this is a market where entrepreneurs have lots of choices and they are making choices on the expertise of the individual partner,” kupor told techcrunch. “the purpose of having more gps is about having the appropriate domain expertise and coverage so we can be in front of the most opportunities out there.” with that in mind, a16z has no plans to slow down on hiring. “we want to make sure we have the right coverage of all the domains we are focused on,” kupor added. a16z is currently investing out of its fifth flagship venture fund, which closed on $1.5 billion in 2016. the firm has raised two bio funds, deploying capital to early-stage startups at the intersection of computer science and life sciences, as well as a $300 million crypto fund and a cultural leadership fund, which counts sean “diddy” combs, shonda rhimes, jada pinkett smith and others as limited partners. connie chan breaks the mold at andreessen horowitz, becoming the first general partner to be promoted from within"
"entrepreneurs and tech executives are widening their gazes outside of developed nations for their next source of growth. ubiquitous cheap phones and increasingly affordable phone plans such as jio in india are helping another billion users join the internet. what do those users want though, and how are they the same and different than existing internet users? that’s the subject of a critical book by payal arora, entitled the next billion users: digital life beyond the west. the compact thesis encompasses a range of argumentative vignettes on how western tech founders and non-profit executives misinterpret the needs of the global poor — and what internet access really means to them. “let’s drop the morality and let’s start engaging with the reality,” arora explained in an interview with techcrunch. “let’s celebrate the mundane over the grand.” that’s the summation of more than two decades working with the global poor and engagement with issues of technology, social media, and entrepreneurship. in her book, arora, who today is a professor at erasmus university rotterdam in the netherlands, argues against narratives that make it hard to see the global poor for who they really are. “the various templates about the global poor today — as blank slates, criminals, deviants, virtuous beings, entrepreneurs, self-organizers, victims, and more — is testament to the mystification strategies at play in the framing of this vast populace.” as she discussed with techcrunch, “[the internet is] basically an always ongoing project, and it’s constantly going to be shaped by the people who use it.” the global poor really want to “play” far from being “exotic,” these users need many of the same things found in the west: entertainment, education, and romance. in fact, there is a huge intellectual gap between what western product leaders believe these next users want, and what they really desire. when youth (and a huge proportion of these new users are young given demographics in emerging markets) acquire digital devices, their top priorities are often listening to music and communicating on social media like facebook . indeed, the entire expansion of technology in many parts of the world are driven not by necessity, but by a desire to have fun. “from jio to facebook, these initiatives have at least one thing in common: they promote leisure usage to motivate people to adopt these new technologies,” arora writes. she emphasizes the importance and challenges of notions of “play” in regard to this new digital divide. as she writes, “the concept of jugaad, or ‘frugal innovation,’ has become pervasive. how to get more from less is the name of the game.” the bottoms-up innovation seen in places like india are a positive form of play, where users remix their technology to meet their needs. yet, that innovation is not always looked upon favorably by western executives. piracy can be rampant in developing economies due to the lack of resources available to pay for western-priced media. “legitimizing the ingenuity of the poor in creating a marketplace for digital leisure through pirated goods comes at the cost of disrupting the core business model of the western media industries.” privacy is much more complicated in these emerging markets every day in the west, there is news of data breaches and privacy violations. europe has passed one of the most comprehensive policies to protect user privacy in the world with gdpr, and concerns around privacy on platforms like facebook are hot issues in silicon valley policymaking circles these days. arora sees a much more complicated relationship with privacy for the global poor though. for these users, “privacy is not such a big issue, not because they don’t care about privacy, not because they don’t quite get it. […] but the fact that it is still — in relation to their actual lives — far more private,” she said. in her book, she writes, “they are savvy hiders when they need to be, and active seekers when they need to be, especially when seeking happiness online.” these new users are often coming from very conservative and gendered societies, where even showing a woman’s face can be grounds for punishment. yet, women and men often use social networks like facebook and twitter as pathways around these rules, purposely using technology to intermediate their social lives. plus, they can be fun. “facebook is a ‘happy’ place. this matters a lot in [brazil’s slums known as] favelas, where young people’s day-to-day lives are entrenched in poverty and violence.” technology of course creates new sets of problems. location-based technologies can help gangs target individuals for harassment or kidnapping. romance scams are proliferating as young men and women try to find a relationship online. a scandalous image can be distributed to the shame of families and entire communities. yet, these simple connections made through tech can make the burdens of living poor just a bit less hard. for entrepreneurs, focus on the mundane arora’s most trenchant criticism is when she analyzes the obsessive focus of silicon valley and its entrepreneurs on grand projects rather than on core needs. she heavily criticizes nicholas negroponte and his one laptop per child program (an argument that at this point feels redundant), along with sugata mitra of the hole-in-the-wall experiment that plopped computers in villages with the belief that it would transform education. in our interview, arora said that “i’m not saying they were not inspirational, but they were brazen in the sense that it was so deeply arrogant.” instead of looking for rocket ships and novel technology, she recommends that product designers simply offer the poor the dignity of meeting the needs they already express. talking about the success of jio in india, arora writes that it’s strategy “was motivated by the ‘abcd principle’ dictating the online market in india — based on the fact that most indian consumers use most of their data to access content on the astrology, bollywood, cricket, and devotion sites.” some founders, government agencies, and aid groups find that conclusion hard to accept. they want to castigate such leisure pursuits and frivolity, arguing that users should be educating themselves and trying to “rescue themselves” out of poverty. arora argues passionately that self-expression, the ability to explore sexuality, to engage with political opinions in a safer space, and more are absolutely the right of the poor to pursue. memorizing molecular biology facts can take a back seat. next billion users doesn’t have a single thesis to offer, to its credit and also detriment. instead, arora offers a selection of anecdotes, data, and perspectives to try to open the reader to a wider world. in that project, she has succeeded, and it is worth anyone who has users outside of soma to take in her cultivated point-of-view. our infrastructure problem is also a data problem image by 31moonlight31 via getty images written by arman tabatabai we’ve been trying to dig deeper into how we got to such a broken system of infrastructure development and why we can’t build anything. this week, we spoke to benjamin schmidt, cto of roadbotics, a startup that collects visual imagery from a smartphone or dashcam and uses an ai / ml platform to identify all the deficiencies in the surrounding infrastructure. roadbotics helps over 100 different governments in the u.s. — from big cities like detroit all the way down to small towns — monitor, manage and understand the state of their roads and infrastructure. the conversation offered great background on the misinformation – or the lack of information altogether – that muddies the infrastructure development process in the u.s. traditionally, governments monitor the state of their physical infrastructure manually – as in they literally have someone drive around and mark down how things look. so monitoring an entire system of infrastructure can be quite costly, and collecting clean data can be incredibly time-consuming. given the expense, schmidt said that some governments wait five and even ten years to resurvey their infrastructure, meaning they’re planning, developing, and operating on outdated information. the most poignant takeaway from the conversation came when schmidt lamented how, after talking to more than 200 governments, he was shocked that practically none had a complete understanding of the state of their road networks. “yet, when governments are asked how much money would be needed to upgrade their roads, they still offer up some definitive number even though they could not possibly know the cost.” the misinformation governments have on the state of their infrastructure, as schmidt observed, is a huge issue for infrastructure planning and costs: on the planning side, without accurately knowing what and where specific deficiencies lie throughout their systems, governments can’t really develop infrastructure through the “minimal operable segments” model we discussed recently – where they work on smaller projects that can be built cheaper, more quickly and more efficiently. instead, policymakers opt for megaprojects and overhauls of entire systems, which are hard to coordinate and have huge costs and geographic exposure that lead to the scope creep and political gamesmanship infrastructure expert phil plotch described in our recent conversation. schmidt pointed out that since many governments are severely behind collecting data on their infrastructure, it’s now a massive undertaking for them to try to resurvey and understand it. therefore, projects are often proposed and started without a fully comprehensive execution plan in place, with developers instead surveying and studying the infrastructure after approval, leading to the route and plan revisions that inflate costs by billions of dollars seen with california’s high-speed rail project. even at a higher level, if governments don’t know the state of their infrastructure, they don’t know how much it’s going to cost to fix. with no accurate idea of what the real bill may ultimately come out to, policymakers underestimate costs to push projects through and we see the drastic cost overruns that dwarf estimates in initial proposals or early plans. silicon valley loves to analogize data as the “new oil,” but governments still need to build their first wells if they are ever to bring infrastructure costs back to earth. obsessions perhaps some more challenges around data usage and algorithmic accountability we have a bit of a theme around emerging markets, macroeconomics, and the next set of users to join the internet. more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure, and “why can’t we build things” thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people, and companies.

"stephen yaxley-lennon, a far right uk activist who was permanently banned from facebook last week for repeatedly breaching its community standards on hate speech, was nonetheless able to use its platform to livestream harassment of an anti-fascist blogger whom he doorstepped at home last night. uk-based blogger mike stuchbery detailed the intimidating incident in a series of tweets earlier today, writing that yaxley-lennon appeared to have used a friend’s facebook account to circumvent the ban on his own facebook and instagram pages. i've spent the last few months documenting how 'tommy robinson’ uses doorstepping to intimidate his critics, and how social media giants have enabled it. so what does he do? turns up at my house tonight. 1/ pic.twitter.com/nbb4b636ey — mike stuchbery💀🍷 (@mikestuchbery_) march 5, 2019 in recent years yaxley-lennon, who goes by the moniker ‘tommy robinson’ on social media, has used online platforms to raise his profile and solicit donations to fund far right activism. he has also, in the case of facebook and twitter, fallen foul of mainstream tech platforms’ community standards which prohibit use of their tools for hate speech and intimidation. earning himself a couple of bans. (at the time of writing yaxley-lennon has not been banned from google-owned youtube .) though circumventing facebook’s ban appears to have been trivially easy for yaxley-lennon, who, as well as selling himself as a far right activist called “tommy robinson”, previously co-founded the islamophobic far right pressure group, the english defence league. giving an account of being doorstepped by yaxley-lennon in today’s independent, stuchbery writes: “the first we knew of it was a loud, frantic rapping on my door at around quarter to 11 [in the evening]… that’s when notifications began to buzz on my phone — message requests on facebook pouring in, full of abuse and vitriol. “tommy” was obviously livestreaming his visit, using a friend’s facebook account to circumvent his ban, and had tipped off his fans.” a repost (to youtube) of what appears to be a facebook live stream of the incident corroborates stuchbery’s account, showing yaxley-lennon outside a house at night where can be seen shouting for “mike” to come out and banging on doors and/or windows. at another point in the same video yaxley-lennon can be seen walking away when he spots a passerby and engages them in conversation. during this portion of the video yaxley-lennon publicly reveals stuchbery’s address — a harassment tactic that’s known as doxxing. he can also be heard making insinuating remarks to the unidentified passerby about what he claims are stuchbery’s “wrong” sexual interests. in another tweet today stuchbery describes the remarks are defamatory, adding that he now intends to sue yaxley-lennon. a couple of things: first, let me assure you, i take my reputation very, very seriously. for 'tommy’ to call me a paedophile is defamatory in the extreme. we've got it on video. see you in court, 'tommy’. /9 — mike stuchbery💀🍷 (@mikestuchbery_) march 5, 2019 stuchbery has also posted several screengrabs to twitter, showing a number of facebook users who he is not connected to sending him abusive messages — presumably during the livestream. during the video yaxley-lennon can also be heard making threats to return, saying: “mike stuchbery. see you soon mate, because i’m coming back and back and back and back.” at the same time, messages came flooding in via social media. despite being banned by facebook, he was using a mate's account to stream – and the abuse came flooding in. /5 pic.twitter.com/doyzinsewo — mike stuchbery💀🍷 (@mikestuchbery_) march 5, 2019 in a second livestream, also later reposted to youtube, yaxley-lennon can be heard apparently having returned a second time to stuchbery’s house, now at around 5am, to cause further disturbance. stuchbery writes that he called the police to report both visits. in another tweet he says they “eventually talked ‘tommy’ into leaving, but not before he gave my full address, threatened to come back tomorrow, in addition to making a documentary ‘exposing me'”. i called the police – who wouldn't? they came and eventually talked 'tommy’ into leaving, but not before he gave my full address, threatened to come back tomorrow, in addition to making a documentary 'exposing me’. /7 — mike stuchbery💀🍷 (@mikestuchbery_) march 5, 2019 we reached out to bedfordshire police to ask what it could confirm about the incidents at stuchbery’s house and the force’s press office told us it had received a number of enquiries about the matter. a spokeswoman added that it would be issuing a statement later today. we’ll update this post when we have it.   update: bedfordshire police have now sent the following statement regarding the incidents: we were called to reports of a man causing a disturbance outside a house in spurcroft, luton at around 10.52pm on monday (4 march) and again at around 5:21am on tuesday (5 march). officers attended and we are now establishing the circumstances around both incidents so we can determine whether any offences have been committed. stuchbery also passed us details of the account he believes was used to livestream the harassment — suggesting it’s linked to another far right activist, known by the moniker ‘danny tommo’, who was also banned by facebook last week. though the facebook account in question was using a different moniker — ‘jack dawkins’. this suggests, if the account did indeed belong to the same banned far right activist, he was also easily able to circumvent facebook’s ban by creating a new account with a different (fake) name and email. we passed the details of the ‘jack dawkins’ account to facebook and since then the company appears to have suspended the account. (a message posted to it earlier today claimed it had been hacked.) the fact of yaxley-lennon being able to use facebook to livestream harassment a few days after he was banned underlines quite how porous facebook’s platform remains for organized purveyors of hate and harassment. studies of facebook’s platform have previously suggested as much. which makes high profile ‘facebook bans’ of hate speech activists mostly a crisis pr exercise for the company. and indeed easy pr for far right activists who have been quick to seize on and trumpet social media bans as ‘evidence’ of mainstream censorship of their point of view — liberally ripping from the playbook of us hate speech peddlers, such as the (also ‘banned’) infowars conspiracy theorist alex jones. such as by posting pictures of themselves with their mouths gagged with tape. such images are intended to make meme-able messages for their followers to share. but the reality for social media savvy hate speech activists like jones and yaxley-lennon looks nothing like censorship — given how demonstrably easy it remains for them to circumvent platform bans and carry on campaigns of hate and harassment via mainstream platforms. we reached out to facebook for a response to yaxley-lennon’s use of its livestreaming platform to harass stuchbery, and to ask how it intends to prevent banned far right activists from circumventing bans and carrying on making use of its platform. the company declined to make a public statement, though it did confirm the livestream had been flagged as violating its community standards last night and was removed afterwards. it also said it had deleted one post by a user for bullying. it added that it has content and safety teams which work around the clock to monitor live videos flagged for review by facebook users. it did not confirm how long yaxley-lennon’s livestream was visible on its platform. stuchbery, a former history teacher, has garnered attention online writing about how far right groups have been using social media to organize and crowdfund ‘direct action’ in the offline world, including by targeting immigrants, muslims, politicians and journalists in the street or on their own doorsteps. but the trigger for stuchbery being personally targeted by yaxley-lennon appears to be a legal letter served to the latter’s family home at the weekend informing him he’s being sued for defamation. stuchbery has been involved in raising awareness about the legal action, including promoting a crowdjustice campaign to raise funds for the suit. the litigation relates to allegations yaxley-lennon made online late last year about a 15-year-old syrian refugee schoolboy called jamal who was shown in a video that went viral being violently bullied by white pupils at his school in northern england. yaxley-lennon responded to the viral video by posting a vlog to social media in which he makes a series of allegations about jamal. the schoolboy’s family have described the allegations as defamatory. and the crowdjustice campaign promoted by stuchbery has since raised more than £10,000 to sue yaxley-lennon. the legal team pursuing the defamation litigation has also written that it intends to explore “routes by which the social media platforms that provide a means of dissemination to lennon can also be attached to this action”. the video of yaxley-lennon making claims about jamal can still be found on youtube. as indeed can yaxley-lennon’s own channel — despite equivalent pages having been removed from facebook and twitter (the latter pulled the plug on yaxley-lennon’s account a year ago). we asked youtube why it continues to provide a platform for yaxley-lennon to amplify hate speech and solicit donations for campaigns of targeted harassment but the company declined to comment publicly on the matter. it did point out it demonetized yaxley-lennon’s channel last month, having determined it breaches its advertising policies. youtube also told us that it removes any video content that violates its hate speech policies — which do prohibit the incitement of violence or hatred against members of a religious community. but by ignoring the wider context here — i.e. yaxley-lennon’s activity as a far right activist — and allowing him to continue broadcasting on its platform youtube is leaving the door open for dog whistle tactics to be used to signal to and stir up ‘in the know’ followers — as was the case with another internet savvy operator, infowars’ alex jones (until youtube eventually terminated his channel last year). until last week facebook was also ignoring the wider context around yaxley-lennon’s far right activism — a decision that likely helped him reach a wider audience than he would otherwise have been able to. so now facebook has another full-blown hate speech ‘influencer’ going rogue on its platform and being cheered by an audience of followers its tools helped amass. there is, surely, a lesson here. yet it’s also clear mainstream platforms are unwilling to pro-actively and voluntarily adapt their rules to close down malicious users who seek to weaponize social media tools to spread hate and sew division via amplified harassment. but if platforms won’t do it, it’ll be left to governments to curb social media’s antisocial impacts with regulation. and in the uk there is now no shortage of appetite to try; the government has a white paper on social media and safety coming this winter. while the official opposition has said it wants to create a new regulator to rein in online platforms and even look at breaking up tech giants. so watch this space. public attitudes to (anti)social media have certainly soured — and with livestreams of hate and harassment it’s little wonder. “perhaps the worst thing, in the cold light of day, is the near certainty that the “content” “tommy” produced during his stunt will now be used as a fundraising tool,” writes stuchbery, concluding his account of being on the receiving end of a facebook live spewing hate and harassment. “if you dare to call him out on his cavalcade of hate, he usually tries to monetize you. it is a cruel twist. “but most of all, i wonder how we got in this mess. i wonder how we got to a place where those who try to speak out against hatred and those who peddle it are threatened at their homes. i despair at how social media has become a weapon wielded by some, seemingly with impunity, to silence.”"
"amazon’s formidable presence in the world of retail stems partly from the fact that it’s just not a commerce giant, it’s also a tech company — building solutions and platforms in-house that make its processes, from figuring out what to sell, to how much to have on hand and how best to distribute it, more efficient and smarter than those of its competition. now, one of the startups that is building retail technology to help those that are not amazon compete better with it, has raised a significant round of funding to meet that challenge. relex — a company out of finland that focuses on retail planning solutions by helping both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce companies make better forecasts of how products will sell using ai and machine learning, and in turn giving those retailers guidance on how and what should be stocked for purchasing — is today announcing that it has raised $200 million from tcv. the vc giant — which has backed iconic companies like facebook, airbnb, netflix, spotify and splunk — last week announced a new $3 billion fund, and this is the first investment out of it that is being made public. relex is not disclosing its valuation, but from what i understand it’s a minority stake, which would put it at between $400 million and $500 million. the company has been around for a few years but has largely been very capital-efficient, raising only between $20 million and $30 million before this from summit partners, with much of that sum still in the bank. that lack of song and dance around vc funding also helped keep the company relatively under the radar, even while it has quietly grown to work with customers like supermarkets albertsons in the u.s., morrisons in the u.k. and a host of others. business today is mostly in north america and europe, with the u.s. growing the fastest, ceo mikko kärkkäinen — who co-founded the company with johanna småros and michael falck — said in an interview. while the company has already been growing at a steady clip — kärkkäinen said sales have been expanding by 50 percent each year for a while now — the plan now will be to accelerate that. relex competes with management systems from sap, jda and oracle, but kärkkäinen said that these are largely “legacy” solutions, in that they do not take advantage of advances in areas like machine learning and cloud computing — both of which form the core of what relex uses — to crunch more data more intelligently. “most retailers are not tech companies, and relex is a clear leader among a lot of legacy players,” said tcv general partner john doran, who led the deal. significantly, that’s an approach that the elephant in the room pioneered and has used to great effect, becoming one of the biggest companies in the world. “amazon has driven quite a lot of change in the industry,” kärkkäinen said (he’s very typically finnish and understated). “but we like to see ourselves as an antidote to amazon.” brick-and-mortar stores are an obvious target for a company like relex, given that shelf space and real estate are costs that these kinds of retailers have to grapple with more than online sellers. but in fact kärkkäinen said that e-commerce companies (given that’s also where amazon primarily operates too) have been an equal target and customer base. “for these, we might be the only solution they have purchased that has not been developed in-house.” the funding will be used in two ways. first, to give the company’s sales a boost, especially in the u.s., where business is growing the fastest at the moment. and second, to develop more services on its current platform. for example, the focus up to now has been on-demand forecasting, kärkkäinen said, and how that effects prices and supply, but it would like to expand its coverage also to labor optimisation alongside that; in other words, how best to staff a business according to forecasts and demands. of course, while amazon is the big competition for all retailers, they potentially also exist as a partner. the company regularly productizes its own in-house services, and it will be interesting to see how and if that translates to amazon emerging as a competitor to relex down the line."
"the continued presence of a u.k. far-right activist on youtube’s platform has been raised by the deputy leader of the official opposition during ministerial questions in the house of commons today. labour’s tom watson put questions to the secretary of state for digital, jeremy wright, regarding stephen yaxley-lennon’s use of social media for targeted harassment of journalists. this follows an incident on monday night when yaxley-lennon used social media tools to live-stream himself banging on the doors and windows of a journalist’s home in the middle of the night. “every major social media platform other than youtube has taken down stephen yaxley-lennon’s profile because of his hateful conduct,” said watson, before recounting how the co-founder of the far right english defence league — who goes by the made-up name “tommy robinson” on social media — used social media live-streaming tools to harass journalist mike stuchbery on monday night. stuchbery has since written about the incident for independent. a journalist intimidated at home at 5am, live streamed. women colleagues facing rape and death threats installing panic buttons. the torrent of online abuse undermines democracy and free speech. we must act to stop the online world turning into a cesspit of hate. pic.twitter.com/6g4fsjeue7 — tom watson (@tom_watson) march 7, 2019 as we reported on monday, facebook removed the live stream for violating its policies after it was reported but not before stuchbery had received a flood of abusive messages from other facebook users who were watching the stream online. yaxley-lennon appears to have been able to circumvent facebook’s ban on his own account to live stream his intimidation of stuchbery via facebook live by using another facebook account with a fake name (which the company appears to have since suspended). following the incident, stuchbery has reported receiving physical hate mail to his home address, which yaxley-lennon gave out during the live stream (an intimidation tactic that’s known as doxxing). he has also said he’s received further abuse online. “does the secretary of state think that it is right that youtube, and the parent company alphabet, continues to give this man a platform?” asked watson, after highlighting another vlog yaxley-lennon has since uploaded to youtube in which he warns other journalists “to expect a knock at the door.” wright responded by saying that “all internet companies, all platforms for this kind of speech need to take their responsibilities seriously.” “i hope that youtube will consider this very carefully,” he told the house of commons. “consider what [yaxley-lennon] has said. what i have said, and reconsider their judgement.” “we all believe in freedom of speech. but we all believe too that that freedom of speech has limits,” wright added. “and we believe that those who seek to intimidate others, to potentially of course break the law… that is unacceptable. that is beyond the reach of the type of freedom of speech that we believe should be protected.” we’ve reached out to youtube for comment. stephen yaxley-lennon was banned by facebook last month for repeat violations of its policies on hate speech. twitter banned yaxley-lennon a full year ago. but he remains active on youtube — where his channel has more than 350,000 subscribers. the company has resisted calls to shutter his account, claiming the content yaxley-lennon posts to its platform is different to content he has posted elsewhere and thus he has not broken any of its rules. (though youtube did demonetize videos on his channel in january, saying they violated its ad policies.) in a follow-up question, watson raised the issue of online harassment more widely — asking whether the government would be including measures “to prevent hate figures, extremists and their followers from turning the online world into a cesspit of hate” in its forthcoming white paper on social media and safety, which it’s due to publish this winter — and thereby tackle a culture of hate and harassment online that he said is undermining democracy. wright said he would “consider” watson’s suggestion, though he stressed the government must protect the ability for people to carry out robust debate online — and “to discuss issues that are sometimes uncomfortable and certainly controversial.” but he went on to reiterate his earlier point that “no freedom of speech can survive in this country if we do not protect… people’s ability to feel free to say what they think, free of intimidation, free of the threat of violence.” “those who engage in intimidation or threats of violence should not find succour either online or anywhere else,” the minister added. youtube’s own community guidelines prohibit “harassment and cyberbullying,” so its continued silence on yaxley-lennon’s misuse of its tools does look inconsistent. (youtube previously banned the infowars conspiracy theorist alex jones for violating its policies, for example, and there’s more than a passing resemblance between the two “hate preachers”). moreover, as watson noted in parliament, yaxley-lennon’s most recent video contains a direct threat to doorstep and doxx journalists who covered his harassment of stuchbery. the video also contains verbal abuse targeted at stuchbery. however, youtube told us the video does not violate its policies. in one of the live streams recorded outside stuchbery’s home, yaxley-lennon can also be heard making allegations about stuchbery’s sexual interests that the journalist has described as defamatory. youtube previously declined to make a statement about yaxley-lennon’s continued presence on its platform. it has not responded to our repeated requests for follow-up comment about the issue since monday. we’ll update this post if it does provide a statement following the government’s call to rethink its position on giving yaxley-lennon a platform. this post was updated with information from youtube regarding yaxley-lennon’s latest video."
"vive has seemed to be devoting a lot of attention to the enterprise, but the company teased their new consumer vr headset called the vive cosmos at ces today. the positionally-tracked headset boasts tracked hand controllers and can be interestingly be powered via pc or “other methods,” making it the first in a new class of hybrid vr headsets. we’d like to give you a first look at vive cosmos, the newest vr headset from vive. #htcvivecosmos #htcvive #viveport pic.twitter.com/op00jxoevu — htc vive (@htcvive) january 7, 2019 the consumer market is going to be a tough one for htc to hold onto. the company’s original htc vive garnered a lot of early excitement, but a series of aggressive price cuts from facebook’s oculus forced the company into a rough spot trying to find hardware margins in the less price-sensitive enterprise market. the company can’t really compete on the same playing field as oculus as facebook ships hardware at seemingly break-even prices, htc’s move seems to therefore sell products that facebook wouldn’t make in the first place. what’s interesting is that htc is relying on embedded inside-out tracking technology for this device, essentially removing steamvr — valve’s highly-accurate tracking tech — from the equation. this could be a big risk to htc, as their main consumer market seems to be those looking to push high-end experiences and the alignment with valve and steamvr has been a big selling point there. the vive cosmos will run htc’s new vivers operating system. it’s unclear what kind of onboard compute will be available and how exactly the device is powered besides a pc connection. what’s really going to matter is implementation and what kind of experiences without a pc. if the company can eek out performance that enables headset and controller positionally-tracked experiences on the device without a pc connection, they’d have something that could potentially be an interesting challenger to the $399 oculus quest, though it would assumedly operate at a much higher price point. there’s still a lot we don’t know like specs, price or release date. more info will be available “in the coming months,” according to the company."
"facebook will end its unpaid market research programs and proactively take its onavo vpn app off the google play store in the wake of backlash following techcrunch’s investigation about onavo code being used in a facebook research app the sucked up data about teens. the onavo protect app will eventually shut down, and will immediately cease pulling in data from users for market research, though it will continue operating as a virtual private network in the short-term to allow users to find a replacement. facebook has also ceased to recruit new users for the facebook research app that still runs on android but was forced off of ios by apple after we reported that it violated apple’s enterprise certificate program for employee-only apps. existing facebook research app studies will continue to run, though. with the suspicions about tech giants and looming regulation leading to more intense scrutiny of privacy practices, facebook has decided that giving users a utility like a vpn in exchange for quietly examining their app usage and mobile browsing data isn’t a wise strategy. instead, it will focus on paid programs where users explicitly understand what privacy they’re giving up for direct financial compensation. onavo billed itself as a way to “limit apps from using background data” and “use a secure vpn network for your personal info” but also noted it would collect the “time you spend using apps, mobile and wi-fi data you use per app, the websites you visit, and your country, device and network type.” a facebook spokesperson confirmed the change and provided this statement: “market research helps companies build better products for people. we are shifting our focus to reward-based market research which means we’re going to end the onavo program.” facebook acquired onavo in 2013 for a reported $200 million to use its vpn app to gather data about what people were doing on their phones. that data revealed whatsapp was sending over twice as many messages per day as messenger, buzzfeed’s ryan mac and charlie warzel reported, convincing facebook to pay a steep sum of $19 billion to buy whatsapp. facebook went on to frame onavo as a way for users to reduce their data usage, block dangerous websites, keep their traffic safe from snooping — while facebook itself was analyzing that traffic. the insights helped it discover new trends in mobile usage, keep an eye on competitors and figure out what features or apps to copy. cloning became core to facebook’s product strategy over the past years, with instagram’s version of snapchat stories growing larger than the original. but last year, privacy concerns led apple to push facebook to remove the onavo vpn app from the app store, though it continued running on google play. but facebook quietly repurposed onavo code for use in its facebook research app that techcrunch found was paying users in the u.s. and india ages 13 to 35 up to $20 in gift cards per month to give it vpn and root network access to spy on all their mobile data. facebook ran the program in secret, obscured by intermediary beta testing services like betabound and applause. it only informed users it recruited with ads on instagram, snapchat and elsewhere that they were joining a facebook research program after they’d begun signup and signed non-disclosure agreements. a facebook spokesperson claimed in a statement that “there was nothing ‘secret’ about this”, yet it had threatened legal action if users publicly discussed the research program. but the biggest problem for facebook ended up being that its research app abused apple’s enterprise certificate program meant for employee-only apps to distribute the app outside the company. that led apple to ban the research app from ios and invalidate facebook’s certificate. this shut down facebook’s internal ios collaboration tools, pre-launch test versions of its popular apps and even its lunch menu and shuttle schedule to break for 30 hours, causing chaos at the company’s offices. to preempt any more scandals around onavo and the facebook research app and avoid google stepping in to forcibly block the apps, facebook is now taking onavo off the play store and stopping recruitment of research testers. that’s a surprising voluntary move that perhaps shows facebook is finally getting in tune with the public perception of its shady actions. the company has repeatedly misread how users would react to its product launches and privacy invasions, leading to near constant gaffes and an unending news cycle chronicling its blunders. without onavo, facebook loses a powerful method of market research, and its future initiatives here will come at a higher price. facebook has run tons of focus groups, surveys and other user feedback programs over the past decade to learn where it could improve or what innovations it could co-opt. and with more apps recently turning on encryption, onavo likely started learning less about their usage. but given how cloning plus acquisitions like whatsapp and instagram have been vital to facebook’s success, it’s likely worth paying out more gift cards and more tightly monitoring its research practices. otherwise facebook could miss the next big thing that might disrupt it. hopefully facebook will be less clandestine with its future market research programs. it should be upfront about its involvement, make certain that users understand what data they’re giving up, stop researching teens or at the very least verify the consent of their parents and avoid slurping up sensitive information or data about a user’s unwitting friends. for a company that depends on people to trust it with their content, it has a long way to go win back our confidence. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them"
"users are complaining that the phone number facebook hassled them to use to secure their account with two-factor authentication has also been associated with their user profile — which anyone can use to “look up” their profile. worse, facebook doesn’t give you an option to opt-out. last year, facebook was forced to admit that after months of pestering its users to switch on two-factor by signing up their phone number, it was also using those phone numbers to target users with ads. but some users are finding out just now that facebook’s default setting allows everyone — with or without an account — to look up a user profile based off the same phone number previously added to their account. the recent hubbub began today after a tweet by jeremy burge blew up, criticizing facebook’s collection and use of phone numbers, which he likened to “a unique id that is used to link your identity across every platform on the internet.” for years facebook claimed the adding a phone number for 2fa was only for security. now it can be searched and there's no way to disable that. pic.twitter.com/zpyhuwadms — jeremy burge 🐥🧿 (@jeremyburge) march 1, 2019 although users can hide their phone number on their profile so nobody can see it, it’s still possible to “look up” user profiles in other ways, such as “when someone uploads your contact info to facebook from their mobile phone,” according to a facebook help article. it’s a more restricted way than allowing users to search for user profiles using a person’s phone number, which facebook restricted last year after admitting “most” users had their information scraped. facebook gives users the option of allowing users to “look up” their profile using their phone number to “everyone” by default, or to “friends of friends” or just the user’s “friends.” but there’s no way to hide it completely. security expert and academic zeynep tufekci said in a tweet: “using security to further weaken privacy is a lousy move — especially since phone numbers can be hijacked to weaken security,” referring to sim swapping, where scammers impersonate cell customers to steal phone numbers and break into other accounts. see thread! using security to further weaken privacy is a lousy move—especially since phone numbers can be hijacked to weaken security. putting people at risk. what say you @facebook? https://t.co/9qkttodkrd — zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) march 2, 2019 tufekci’s argued that users can “no longer keep keep private the phone number that [they] provided only for security to facebook.” facebook spokesperson jay nancarrow told techcrunch that the settings “are not new,” adding that, “the setting applies to any phone numbers you added to your profile and isn’t specific to any feature.” gizmodo reported last year that when a user gives facebook a phone number for two-factor, it “became targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks.” if a user doesn’t like it, they can set up two-factor without using a phone number — which hasn’t been mandatory for additional login security since may 2018. but even if users haven’t set up two-factor, there are well documented cases of users having their phone numbers collected by facebook, whether the user expressly permitted it or not. a spokesperson for the irish data protection agency said it is “making enquiries with facebook to get a better understanding of the issue.” in 2017, one reporter for the telegraph described her alarm at the “look up” feature, given she had “not given facebook my number, was unaware that it had found it from other sources, and did not know it could be used to look me up.” whatsapp, the messaging app also owned by facebook (alongside messenger and instagram), uses your phone number as the primary way to create your account and connect you to its service. facebook has long had a strategy to further integrate the two services, although it has run into some bumps along the way. to the specific concerns by users, facebook said: “we appreciate the feedback we’ve received about these settings and will take it into account.” concerned users should switch their “look up” settings to “friends” to mitigate as much of the privacy risk as possible. when asked specifically if facebook will allow users to users to opt-out of the setting, facebook said it won’t comment on future plans. and, asked why it was set to “everyone” by default, facebook said the feature makes it easier to find people you know but aren’t yet friends with. others criticized facebook’s move to expose phone numbers to “look ups,” calling it “unconscionable.” alex stamos, former chief security officer and now adjunct professor at stanford university, also called out the practice in a tweet. “facebook can’t credibly require two-factor for high-risk accounts without segmenting that from search and ads,” he said. since stamos left facebook in august, facebook has not hired a replacement chief security officer. updated with comment from the irish data protection agency. natasha lomas contributed reporting. facebook’s weapon amid chaos and controversy: misdirection"
"snapchat isn’t growing again, but at least it didn’t hemorrhage any more users in its q4 earnings report. the company stayed flat at 186 million daily users after falling from 191 million in q1 to 188 million in q2 to 186 million in q3. it exceeded an expected quarterly count of 184.2 million user, though 186 million is still down 0.3 percent year-over-year. it reached record revenue of $390 million in the holiday quarter, up 36 percent year-over-year to beat the $378 million wall street estimate, and snapchat lost just $0.04 per share compared to wall street’s $0.08 loss estimate for a beat in q4 earnings. the highlight of the earnings report was that snap has managed a 68 percent year-over-year improvement in its adjusted ebitda losses, which came in at $50 million (though net loss was still $158 million). with 43 percent full-year revenue growth in 2018, “this limited our q4 losses to just 13 percent of our revenue, compared to just one year ago when our q4 losses totaled more than 50 percent of revenue” ceo evan spiegel wrote in his opening remarks. that means snap might make it to profitability in the next year or two before running out of cash and having to take more from big investors or consider being acquired. after closing at $7.04 today, snap was up around 17 percent in after hours trading to hover around $8.27 — still way down from a peak of $20.75 a year ago. importantly, snapchat grew its europe user count from 59 million to 60 million and stayed flat at 79 million in north america. since those are its two best monetizing markets, stopping the shrinkage there was critical. that helped spur a 37 percent year-over-year increase in global average revenue per user, and a 30 percent boost over q3. looking forward, snap expects between $285 million and $310 million in q1 2019, which would be a 24 percent to 34 percent year-over-year increase, while its adjusted ebitda losses are expected to be between $165 million and $140 million, down from $218 million in q1. it ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and securities. on the content and engagement front, snap is reaching 70 percent of total us 13 to 34 year olds with premium mobile video, which could be very lucrate if it can keep its user count stable or growing. 70 precent of users played with or viewed a lens each day, though snap didn’t provide an update on its snaps created per day metric that’s useful for judging the health of its messaging feature. but it does say that users still average 30 minutes per day on the app. 30 percent more people are watching its discover section’s publisher stories and shows every day versus last year, with snapchat’s new algorithmically personalized bitmoji stories seeing 40 million viewers in december. that’s powerful because since snap makes the content in-house, it doesn’t have to share ad revenue with anyone. meanwhile, snapchat announced it’s finally starting to roll out its android rebuild to some users, and the initial test results were promising. app startup time was reduced 20 percent, and the improvements could reinvigorate snapchat for android’s growth after years of bugs and slow loading dragging down snapchat’s user count. snapchat’s future hinges on its ability to get to profitability so it can keep financing r&d in augmented reality and hardware. snap won’t be able to keep up with dedicated ar companies like magic leap or tech giants like facebook and apple if it’s constantly trying to cut costs. it could still be years before fashionable and useful ar eyewear is feasible and snap must weather the storm until then. the fact that it’s no longer bleeding users and its losses are falling shows great progress in that direction. most tech giants like apple and google end up sitting on their cash, unsure what to invest in. snapchat seems to have plenty of options if it can just start stockpiling cash instead of spending it all. snapchat’s android usage keeps falling but rebuild tests promising"
"an ongoing case in singapore is testing the legal boundaries of virtual conferences. a court in the southeast asian city-state this week convicted human rights activist jolovan wham of organizing a public assembly via skype without a permit and refusing to sign his statement when ordered by the police. wham will be sentenced on january 23 and faces a fine of up to s$5,000 or a jail term of up to three years. the judge in charge of the case, however, has not provided grounds of his decision, wham wrote on twitter. i've been found guilty 'beyond reasonable doubt'. but the grounds of decision are not available yet. the judge also did not explain his decision in court. https://t.co/1djxmuv0tn — jolovan wham (@jolovanwham) january 3, 2019 wham, 39, is a social worker at community action network singapore consisting of a group of activists, social workers and journalists advocating civil and political rights. he previously served as executive director of migrant worker advocacy group humanitarian organisation for migration economics. on november 26, 2016, wham organized an indoor forum called “civil disobedience and social movements” at a small event space inside a shopping mall in singapore. the event featured prominent hong kong student activist joshua wong, who addressed the audience remotely via a skype video call. the event’s facebook page indicates that 355 people were interested and 121 went. the skype discussion, which lasted around two hours, was also live-streamed on facebook by the online citizen sg, a social media platform focused on political activism, and garnered 5,700 views. despite being advised by the police to obtain a permit prior to the event, wham proceeded without said consent, according to a statement by the singapore police force. wham faced similar charges of organizing public assemblies without police permits and refusing to sign statements under the penal code. in singapore, it is a criminal offence under the public order act to organize or participate in a public assembly without a police permit. the police described wham’s act as “recalcitrant” in regard to organizing and participating in illegal public assemblies. commenting on the charge against wham, a joint statement from joshua wong and members of can singapore argued that the event was “closed-door.” “skype conversations that take place within the confines of a private space are private matters that should logically, not require permits before they can be carried out,” raged the statement. “wham’s discussion with wong ended peacefully and would not have drawn any further attention if authorities hadn’t decided to act.” “it was a discussion about civil disobedience and social movements,” wham pointed out in another twitter post. “the law says that any event which is open to the public, and is ’cause related’, requires a permit when a foreigner speaks. what is considered ’cause related’ isn’t clear.”"
"the field of technology and the business practices within it tend to advance faster than regulators can keep up. but the ftc is making a concerted effort with a new 17-lawyer tech task force dedicated to ensuring “free and fair competition” and watching for anticompetitive conduct among technology companies. this isn’t necessarily a precursor to some big action like breaking up a big company or imposing rules or anything like that. it seems to be more a recognition that the ftc needs to be ready to ascertain quickly and move decisively in tech matters, and a crack team of tech-savvy staff attorneys is the way to do it. the technology task force will live under the competition bureau within the ftc, the director of which, bruce hoffman, commented as follows in the agency’s announcement: technology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust enforcement. by centralizing our expertise and attention, the new task force will be able to focus on these markets exclusively – ensuring they are operating pursuant to the antitrust laws, and taking action where they are not. that it is under this bureau and not the bureau of consumer protection gives a good indicator of its purpose. this won’t be a way for the ftc to, for instance, more closely scrutinize google or facebook’s shady user data practices. that said, the lawyers are stated to have expertise in “advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platform businesses,” which i doubt they mention for no reason. instead it is likely to be more focused on investigating and reporting on potential anticompetitive practices that are the potential result of m&a deals or quasi-monopolies like amazon and facebook. the fascinating amazon’s antitrust paradox paper from a while back noted all kinds of ways that a company slips through loopholes while performing actions that look, walk and talk like monopolistic ones. but just what exactly constitutes such practices legally speaking is a matter of considerable debate. no doubt the lawyers and their tech fellows, with whom they will consult, will spend a great deal of time sifting through old cases and precedents and seeing what does and doesn’t apply. the team will be performing its own investigations of ongoing and completed mergers, and will also supply investigative services to other branches of the agency. essentially it’s an indication that the ftc will be taking tech antitrust more seriously going forward, and dedicating more and better organized resources to the task of monitoring the sector. that’s probably not the kind of thing big tech companies like to hear. i’ve asked the agency some questions as far as markets they’ll be watching, behaviors they’re looking for and so on. i’ll update this post if i hear back."
"having reached critical mass, netflix shows are now influencing culture — whether that’s prompting everyone to “tidy up” or causing chaos with “bird box”-inspired challenges. for good or bad, what happens on netflix is talked about, memed and shared across the social media landscape. today, netflix is launching a new feature aimed at better inserting its brand into those online conversations: instagram story integration. launching first on ios, netflix users will be able to share their favorite movies and shows to their instagram story right from the netflix mobile app. the feature will add the title’s custom art to a users’ instagram story, where it remains visible for 24 hours. the story can also be customized with other options, like a user poll, for example. if the viewer has the netflix app installed on their iphone, they’ll see a “watch on netflix” link in the story that takes them to the show’s or movie’s page in the netflix app when tapped. this isn’t the first time you could share a show from netflix’s app to a social platform — that’s been supported for some time. however, the existing experience will pull up ios’s “share sheet” (the built-in sharing function in the ios operating system). according to a screenshot provided by netflix, however, the new sharing feature is now a part of the netflix app itself. after tapping “share,” a screen appears with various options, including whatsapp, messages, messenger, twitter, line and more, in addition to the newly added “instagram stories.” the launch follows facebook’s introduction of an option last year that allows third-party apps to share their in-app content to instagram stories. the idea was to provide users with an alternative to screenshotting what they wanted to share from other apps — like a song, a video, a playlist, etc. — to instagram stories. it’s also meant to provide a more seamless experience for the story’s viewers, as they’re able to tap the story to engage with the shared content — while also giving the brand more control over the look-and-feel of what’s being shared. in netflix’s case, it’s branding shared title art with the name of the show or film, as well as a teaser or slogan, and the words “netflix original,” where relevant. (the feature works with all titles, not just originals.) the feature could prompt more word-of-mouth recommendations between friends and followers on instagram, whose stories platform alone is bigger than snapchat, reaching more than 400 million users. and it could help content go viral within a certain fan base or demographic — like teen girl viewers or sci-fi fans, for instance — as prominent instagram accounts shared the netflix show. “we’re always on the lookout for ways to make it easier for members to share the netflix titles they’re obsessing about and help them discover something new to watch,” said netflix in a statement about the launch. instagram stories integration is launching today on ios to netflix users worldwide. an android version is in the works."
"trust is a fundamental building block of any healthy relationship, whether that’s between individuals or companies and customers. if you can’t trust the company you are doing business with to do the right thing by you, it’s hard to continue the relationship. too often, we have seen this trust broken when it comes to data sharing. last week, a wall street journal article revealed a practice of apps sharing highly personal data with facebook without user knowledge, whether the user had a facebook account or not. in a follow-up article, the wsj listed all 11 apps in its study (five of which stopped sharing data after being contacted by the publication). these included ovulation and heart-monitoring apps. whatever the reason, if your users aren’t aware that you are sharing their data in this fashion, and that would appear to be the case, then it’s a gross violation of trust between user and brand. marc benioff, co-ceo and co-founder at salesforce, has often stated that trust is one of the primary components of a healthy brand-customer relationship. if you mess that up, it’s going to be very tough going for you as a business. in an interview in september with bloomberg’s emily chang, benioff had this to say about trust. “every ceo needs to ask themselves what is the most important thing to you. what is the most important thing to your company? what is your highest value? i know our highest value at salesforce is trust. nothing is more important than the trust that we have that we have with our customers or employees or partners or our top executives,” benioff explained. he went on to say when companies misuse customer’s data, they are breaking that trust and that could involve losing key personnel or customers. “when you see top executives walking out. when you see customers questioning your privacy practices or how you’re using or misusing their data or how you’re misusing partnerships, you need to listen. you need to wake up. you need to [ask] what is going on. it’s very serious,” benioff said if benioff is right, and trust is the basis of all business relationships, then you’re playing with fire when you abuse the trust by sharing data with third parties without your customer’s knowledge, and sooner or later that’s going to come back and bite you as a brand. let’s face it, people stop using apps for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with something as fundamental as trust. it could just be buggy or slow, but when the app is sending data to another company without user knowledge, it’s easy enough to just remove it from the phone and find another one that doesn’t do that (or at least you hope it doesn’t). for brands, perception is everything. if people begin to think you are not looking out for their best interests, or are putting profit over common sense protections, it becomes difficult to turn around those negative feelings once they begin to harden. if the brand continues to abuse its users time and again, it will eventually have an impact on revenue and begin to hurt your relationship with your existing customer base, and your ability to attract new customers to your products and services. it seems like a risk that would be too big to take, yet we see brands take these risks time and again. if you don’t want to go that route, it’s pretty easy to prevent. do right by your customers and they’ll continue to believe in you — or don’t, and watch what happens. your customer’s online journey is only part of the story"
"researchers at michigan state university are exploring the idea that there’s more to “social media addiction” than casual joking about being too online might suggest. their paper, titled “excessive social media users demonstrate impaired decision making in the iowa gambling task” (meshi, elizarova, bender and verdejo-garcia) and published in the journal of behavioral addictions, indicates that people who use social media sites heavily actually display some of the behavioral hallmarks of someone addicted to cocaine or heroin. the study asked 71 participants to first rate their own facebook usage with a measure known as the bergen facebook addiction scale. the study subjects then went on to complete something called the iowa gambling task (igt), a classic research tool that evaluates impaired decision making. the igt presents participants with four virtual decks of cards associated with rewards or punishments and asks them to choose cards from the decks to maximize their virtual winnings. as the study explains, “participants are also informed that some decks are better than others and that if they want to do well, they should avoid the bad decks and choose cards from the good decks.” what the researchers found was telling. study participants who self-reported as excessive facebook users actually performed worse than their peers on the igt, frequenting the two “bad” decks that offer immediate gains but ultimate result in losses. that difference in behavior was statistically significant in the latter portion of the igt, when a participant has had ample time to observe the deck’s patterns and knows which decks present the greatest risk. the igt has been used to study everything from patients with frontal lobe brain injuries to heroin addicts, but using it as a measure to examine social media addicts is novel. along with deeper, structural research, it’s clear that researchers can apply to social media users much of the existing methodological framework for learning about substance addiction. the study is narrow, but interesting, and offers a few paths for follow-up research. as the researchers recognize, in an ideal study, the researchers could actually observe participants’ social media usage and sort them into categories of high or low social media usage based on behavior rather than a survey they fill out. future research could also delve more deeply into excessive users across different social networks. the study only looked at facebook use, “because it is currently the most widely used [social network] around the world,” but one could expect to see similar results with the billion-plus monthly instagram and potentially the substantially smaller portion of people on twitter. ultimately, we know that social media is shifting human behavior and potentially its neurological underpinnings, we just don’t know the extent of it — yet. due to the methodical nature of behavioral research and the often extremely protracted process of publishing it, we likely won’t know for years to come the results of studies conducted now. still, as this study proves, there are researchers at work examining how social media is impacting our brains and our behavior — we just might not be able to see the big picture for some time."
"a bug that anyone can easily exploit in google makes it easy to kick out manipulated search results that look entirely real. the search manipulation bug was documented by wietze beukema, a london-based security specialist, who warned that a malicious user could use this bug to generate misinformation. this is done by splicing together values from a google search result’s “knowledge graph,” the cards that pop up in search results to supplement the search query with visuals and quick facts. anything from countries, planets, tech news sites and more have cards that appear on the right-side of google’s search results, displaying other nuggets of information at a glance. in a blog post, beukema explained that the short, shareable url when entered into a google search result could be chopped and added to the web address of any other search query. so, when you’d search: “what is the capital of britain,” you’d expect london to return. actually, you can make it any value — such as mars. it also works if you search “who is the us president?” you can just manipulate the result to read “snoop dogg.” a bug makes it easy to put the contents of a knowledge card into a search result. (image: techcrunch)the manipulated search query doesn’t break https, so anyone can craft a link, send it in an email, tweet it out or share it on facebook — and the recipient, one assumes, would be none the wiser. but that can be a real problem in an age of mistrust of internet companies after misinformation campaigns by nation-state actors. beukema warned that this search manipulation bug could be used to spread factually incorrect information, or even propaganda. “who is responsible for 9/11?” can be pointed to george bush, a widely held conspiracy theory. “where was barack obama born?” can be pointed to kenya, another conspiracy theory largely propagated by his successor, donald trump, who later backtracked on the claim. and even, “which party should i vote for?” can be pointed to either the republicans or the democrats. no wonder so many people think the election was rigged if they think they can click a button and have a search engine tell them who to vote for. beukema told techcrunch that anyone can “generate normal-looking google urls that make controversial assertions,” which can “either look bad on google, or worse, people will accept them as being true.” he said that he first reported the bug to google in december 2017, but the report was closed without the company taking any action. “the ‘attack’ i described relies on this trust people have in google and the facts it presents,” he said. the bug is still active at the time of writing. in fact, it’s been known about for almost three years. beukema simply brought the issue to light after first discovering the issue more than a year ago. but it’s already sparked interest from the hacker community. one developer, lucas miller, took just a few hours to build a python script to automatically generate fake results based on search queries. it’s a mystery why google, despite claims of political bias (though no evidence to say it’s true), has taken so long to fix a basic weakness in its search results that would make the service far more trustworthy. a google spokesperson told techcrunch that it was “working to fix” the issue. cybersecurity 101: how to browse the web securely and privately"
"today in a short blog post, slack announced that it had removed 28 accounts with a “clear affiliation with known hate groups.” few details were provided about the accounts or how slack identified them, but we have reached out to the company for more information. the announcement, brief as it is, comes as a surprise. to date, slack has managed to stay out of the conversation around what happens when sometimes violent politically extreme organizations use popular social platforms to organize. while that conversation should be fairly clear-cut when it comes to public-facing content somewhere like facebook, it’s a bit more nuanced on messaging platforms where communication is private in nature. slack is mostly used for workplace communication, but the chat platform discord, popular with gamers, has been grappling with the same issues. in 2017, discord removed a public server tied to altright.com that the company said violated its rules against harassment and calls for violence. as fringe groups are booted off of mainstream platforms, it will be interesting to see where they wind up and how their new platforms of choice will handle their unsavory new clusters of users. for reference, here’s slack’s full blog post: today we removed 28 accounts because of their clear affiliation with known hate groups. the use of slack by hate groups runs counter to everything we believe in at slack and is not welcome on our platform. slack is designed to help businesses communicate better and more collaboratively so people can do their best work. using slack to encourage or incite hatred and violence against groups or individuals because of who they are is antithetical to our values and the very purpose of slack. when we are made aware of an organization using slack for illegal, harmful, or other prohibited purposes, we will investigate and take appropriate action and we are updating our terms of service to make that more explicit. update: a slack spokesperson declined to offer additional details but provided the following statement. “we don’t normally comment on how we conduct our investigations, but we want to be clear that the privacy of our customer data is sacrosanct,” the slack representative said. “in this case, we were informed of the possible use of slack by hate groups and we were able to determine their affiliation on an organizational level.”"

"update: instagram has confirmed that service is now restored via a tweet sent in the early hours of this morning (cet)… anddddd… we're back. pic.twitter.com/5e8udlcspj — instagram (@instagram) march 14, 2019 facebook has yet to tweet confirmation of its return to stable uptime but at the time of writing the service is at least accessible in europe so it looks to be getting on top of whatever caused the downtime. we’ve reached out to the company for confirmation. original report follows below…  at least one security firm thinks the culprit of the facebook outage could be a border gateway protocol routing leak. routing internet traffic around the world relies on the border gateway protocol (bgp), which manages how internet traffic is routed the internet. bgp relies on trust between network operators to not send incorrect or malicious data. but mistakes happen, and malformed data can form a “route leak” that leads to confusion over where internet traffic should go, and can lead to massive outages. in a bgp route leak, the routing announcements from an autonomous system that guides the information to its destination is inaccurate and is rejected by either receiver, the sender or an intermediary along the route that packet is supposed to travel. that may be what happened to facebook. “at approximately 12:52pm est on march 13th, 2019, it appears that an accidental bgp routing leak from a european isp to a major transit isp, which was then propagated onwards to some peers and/or downstreams of the transit isp in question, resulted in perceptible disruption of access to some well-known internet properties for a short interval,” explained roland dobbins, a netscout principal engineer in an email to techcrunch. at least one professor isn’t convinced that a bgp leak explains the outage. “it is possible that a route leak could have caused/contributed to the outage event facebook and its affiliated applications faced today. when routes are ‘leaked’ erroneously they can have a large impact to the negative on functions and availability of services,” wrote tulane university adjunct faculty member, tom thomas. “however, bgp is a usually a static protocol, meaning that once it’s setup it rarely changes. more likely a cause of this nature would be due to a mistake in programmatic automation and various health checks that they perform to ensure optimal functionality for users. if i had to conjecture, i would suspect that the outage today was likely due to a flaw in the code that controls such functions on a high-level business wise. consider that the impact was across several facebook owned services therefore the likelihood of them trying to be efficient in their code and its centralization for many services is more likely the root cause,” thomas wrote. facebook and its related family of apps have been down for most of wednesday. there’s not much more information to share at this point, but the web is freaking out (as is to be expected). facebook has confirmed the outage and we’ll update as we get more information. we’re aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the facebook family of apps. we’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. — facebook (@facebook) march 13, 2019 the social media management tool naytev also confirmed the outage. “facebook is experiencing a large outage, impacting posting to facebook and the ability to log into naytev. we are actively monitoring the issue and we hope facebook resolves it soon,” the company said in a message to customers seen by techcrunch. as the outage is persisting throughout the day, facebook has taken to twitter to respond to some of the claims that are floating around. the company earlier batted down a rumor that a ddos attack was behind the outage. we're focused on working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, but can confirm that the issue is not related to a ddos attack. — facebook (@facebook) march 13, 2019"
"massive-scale predictive analytics is a relatively new phenomenon, one that challenges both decades of law as well as consumer thinking about privacy. as a technology, it may well save thousands of lives in applications like predictive medicine, but if it isn’t used carefully, it may prevent thousands from getting loans, for instance, if an underwriting algorithm is biased against certain users. i chatted with dennis hirsch a few weeks ago about the challenges posed by this new data economy. hirsch is a professor of law at ohio state and head of its program on data and governance. he’s also affiliated with the university’s risk institute. “data ethics is the new form of risk mitigation for the algorithmic economy,” he said. in a post-cambridge analytica world, every company has to assess what data it has on its customers and mitigate the risk of harm. how to do that, though, is at the cutting edge of the new field of data governance, which investigates the processes and policies through which organizations manage their data. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. “traditional privacy regulation asks whether you gave someone notice and given them a choice,” he explains. that principle is the bedrock for europe’s gdpr law, and for the patchwork of laws in the u.s. that protect privacy. it’s based around the simplistic idea that a datum — such as a customer’s address — shouldn’t be shared with, say, a marketer without that user’s knowledge. privacy is about protecting the address book, so to speak. the rise of “predictive analytics,” though, has completely demolished such privacy legislation. predictive analytics is a fuzzy term, but essentially means interpreting raw data and drawing new conclusions through inference. this is the story of the famous target data crisis, where the retailer recommended pregnancy-related goods to women who had certain patterns of purchases. as charles duhigg explained at the time: many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date. predictive analytics is difficult to predict. hirsch says “i don’t think any of us are going to be intelligent enough to understand predictive analytics.” talking about customers, he said “they give up their surface items — like cotton balls and unscented body lotion — they know they are sharing that, but they don’t know they are giving up their pregnancy status. … people are not going to know how to protect themselves because they can’t know what can be inferred from their surface data.” in other words, the scale of those predictions completely undermines notice and consent. even though the law hasn’t caught up to this exponentially more challenging problem, companies themselves seem to be responding in the wake of target and facebook’s very public scandals. “what we are hearing is that we don’t want to put our customers at risk,” hirsch explained. “they understand that this predictive technology gives them really awesome power and they can do a lot of good with it, but they can also hurt people with it.” the key actors here are corporate chief privacy officers, a role that has cropped up in recent years to mitigate some of these challenges. hirsch is spending significant time trying to build new governance strategies to allow companies to use predictive analytics in an ethical way, so that “we can achieve and enjoy its benefits without having to bear these costs from it.” he’s focused on four areas: privacy, manipulation, bias and procedural unfairness. “we are going to set out principles on what is ethical and and what is not,” he said. much of that focus has been on how to help regulators build policies that can manage predictive analytics. because people can’t understand the extent that inferences can be made with their data, “i think a much better regulatory approach is to have someone who does understand, ideally some sort of regulator, who can draw some lines.” hirsch has been researching how the ftc’s unfairness authority may be a path forward for getting such policies into practice. he analogized this to the food and drug administration. “we have no ability to assess the risks of a given drug [so] we give it to an expert agency and allow them to assess it,” he said. “that’s the kind of regulation that we need.” hirsch overall has a balanced perspective on the risks and rewards here. he wants analytics to be “more socially acceptable,” but at the same time, sees the needs for careful scrutiny and oversight to ensure that consumers are protected. ultimately, he sees that as incredibly beneficial to companies that can take the value out of this tech without risking provoking consumer ire. who will steal your data more: china or america? jaap arriens/nurphoto via getty images talking about data ethics, europe is in the middle of a superpower pincer. china’s telecom giant huawei has made expansion on the continent a major priority, while the united states has been sending delegation after delegation to convince its western allies to reject chinese equipment. the dilemma was quite visible last week at mwc barcelona, where the two sides each tried to make their case. it’s been years since the snowden revelations showed that the united states was operating an enormous eavesdropping infrastructure targeting countries throughout the world, including across europe. huawei has reiterated its stance that it does not steal information from its equipment, and has repeated its demands that the trump administration provide public proof of flaws in its security. there is an abundance of moral relativism here, but i see this as increasingly a litmus test of the west on china. china has not hidden its ambitions to take a prime role in east asia, nor has it hidden its intentions to build a massive surveillance network over its own people or to influence the media overseas. those tactics, though, are straight out of the american playbook, which lost its moral legitimacy over the past two decades from some combination of the iraq war, snowden, wikileaks and other public scandals that have undermined trust in the country overseas. security and privacy might have been a competitive advantage for american products over their chinese counterparts, but that advantage has been weakened for many countries to near zero. we are increasingly going to see countries choose a mix of chinese and american equipment in sensitive applications, if only to ensure that if one country is going to steal their data, it might as well be balanced. things that seem interesting that i haven’t read yet lyft s-1 concrete: the most destructive material on earth | cities | the guardian silicon valley skeptical of washington’s china concerns france plans 5% digital tax as governments chase internet giants – bloomberg status as a service (staas) — remains of the day why american costs are so high (work-in-progress) | pedestrian observations obsessions perhaps some more challenges around data usage and algorithmic accountability we have a bit of a theme around emerging markets, macroeconomics and the next set of users to join the internet more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure and “why can’t we build things?” thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter?

"yoav leitersdorf contributor yoav leitersdorf is a partner at yl ventures. more posts by this contributor trends in israel’s cybersecurity investments the drone race is off and running, with israel in the lead ofer schreiber contributor ofer schreiber is a partner at yl ventures. more posts by this contributor a look back at the israeli cyber security industry in 2018 trends in israel’s cybersecurity investments 2018 saw a spate of major cyber attacks including the hacks of british airways, facebook and marriott. despite growing emphasis on and awareness of cyber threats, large organizations continue experiencing massive data breaches. and as the world becomes increasingly connected (cars and medical devices, among others), attack vectors are evolving and exposures multiply. the israeli cybersecurity industry has long been recognized as a hotbed for innovative solutions, and 2018 to be yet another strong year. early stage companies raised more money than ever before to tackle emerging security threats like protecting the proliferating number of internet-connected devices and enabling blockchain technologies to thrive in more secure environments. growing seed rounds chasing greenfield opportunities in 2018, the total amount of funding for israeli cybersecurity companies across all stages grew 22 percent year-over-year to $1.03b. this closely matched the funding trends of 2016 and 2017 that each saw 23 percent year-over-year growth in funding amount. at the same time, 2018 saw 66 new companies founded, an increase of 10 percent over 2017, which represented a rebound after a dip last year (60 new companies in 2017 vs. 83 in 2016). notably, average seed round increased to $3.6m in 2018 from $3.3m in 2017. 2018 marked the fifth consecutive year the size of israeli cyber seed rounds grew. since 2014, the average seed round size has increased 80 percent. with industry growth metrics of israeli cybersecurity up across the board in 2018, 2017’s dip in new cyber startups appears to have been an outlier. not only does entrepreneurial interest in cyber look to be on the rise, investor enthusiasm, especially at the early stages, signals a market brimming with opportunity. growing round sizes are interesting, but more revealing is following where this capital is flowing. emerging fields supplanting “traditional” technologies the top emerging fields among new startups in 2018 included new verticals within iot security, security for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, cloud-native security and sdp (software defined perimeter). these nascent verticals drew considerably more attention than more “traditional” cyber sectors such as network security, email security and endpoint protection. of all the emerging sectors, iot drew the most investment with funding reaching $229.5m across all stages. what makes iot particularly interesting is its continual branching into various new sub-domains including automotive, drones and medical devices. shai morag, ceo and co-founder of secdo, an israeli cybersecurity firm acquired for $100m by palo alto networks in mid-2018, sees these trends accelerating. “innovation is going to keep happening in these areas for the next few years. we’ll also see innovation in third-party supply-chain risk assessment and management. another wide-open field for innovation is smbs. they are an underserved market hungry for full-stack solutions. these emerging fields are where i’m seeing the most excitement.” breaking out data on seed round funding into cyber startups targeting emerging vs. traditional markets reveals an even more pronounced growth trend. 2018’s aggressive early stage funding rounds disproportionately focused on companies pursuing emerging fields within cybersecurity. of the 33 seed rounds raised in 2018, 20 (61 percent) went to companies in emerging fields. even more striking, the sum of all seed rounds for emerging tech companies in 2018 was $79m, a 76 percent year-over-year increase. the numbers are clear, there is overwhelming investor interest in emerging cyber tech. for example, the two largest seed funding rounds this year were in the iot security domain. vdoo, founded by ex-cyvera entrepreneurs (acquired by palo alto networks in 2014 for $200m) and which develops security solutions for iot vendors, raised an abnormally high seed round of $13m. toka cyber has secured $12.5m seed funding from andreessen horowitz and others, to develop and expand their iot cybersecurity platform for governmental agencies. twistlock, a pioneer developer of cloud-native security solutions raised $33m series c this year. bigid which protects sensitive data in light of gdpr and other privacy regulations raised both a ($14m) and b ($30m) rounds during 2018. as the more traditional cybersecurity markets continue to consolidate and mature, prospects dim for “me too” cyber startups. we see that the industry still faces pressing problems in need of innovative solutions. looming labor shortages, gdpr and other global data privacy legislation and the iot explosion, are major challenges presenting substantial opportunities to incumbents able to provide relief. investors and entrepreneurs sense greenfield opportunities on the horizon and are racing to plant their flags before the competition. this new divergent ecosystem is more selective of sophisticated, savvy investors and specialized, seasoned entrepreneurs. greenfields, not green founders in 2018, 60 percent of founders had more than a decade’s worth of experience in the private sector–a 28 percent increase from 2017. the experience of these more seasoned founders came mostly from working in startups either as an executive or as an entrepreneur. although israel’s cybersecurity ecosystem relies heavily on the technical training potential entrepreneurs receive during service in the israeli defense forces (idf), in 2018, the proportion of founders coming straight out of the idf fell to 2 percent, dropping from 10 percent the year before. while nearly all israeli founders leverage the skills and know-how acquired in the idf’s various technological units, the need for experience from the private sector, either as an executive or an employee, seems to be more prevalent. larger seed checks and larger ambitions are fuelling this push for more mature, veteran founders. rising founders are not simply looking to build a novel technology and score a lucrative acquihire exit from an existing giant–they want to push into greenfield territory and stake a market-leading claim all their own. amichai shulman, co-founder & former cto of imperva and a venture advisor at yl ventures, gives such founders aiming to “own a market” the following advice: “make sure you’re able to explain – primarily to yourselves – how your offering and product becomes something bigger than what it inherently is in the beginning. be able to articulate how you expand (in the future) further into organizations, not just by ‘selling more’ but by solving bigger and more general problems.” cyber exits continue to overperform beyond general trends, 2018 also had many exciting individual exits. checkpoint-dome9 and cyberark-vaultive were notable because both acquirer and acquiree were israeli — a mark of true market maturity. the acquisition of sygnia by singaporean holding giant temasek also was remarkable because it shows that the israeli cyber market continues to attract new classes and kinds of global strategic players each year. in addition, thoma bravo’s  $2.1b acquisition of israeli cyber firm imperva made waves throughout the industry. tsahy shapsa, co-founder of cloudlock, which was acquired by cisco in 2016 for $293m, reflected on the potential he sees coming from growing global investment. “from an entrepreneurial perspective, there is a constant dilemma between short-/mid-term exits and building a legacy company. as funding floods into israel from around the world, temptation to sell early only increases. but all these exits have an advantage. they grow the pool of experienced, ‘repeat’ entrepreneurs and set the stage for more legacy companies to originate locally.” zohar alon, ceo and co-founder of dome9 security, which was acquired by checkpoint in 2018 for $175m added the following guidance: “israeli entrepreneurs should establish and maintain a constant communication channel with the local corporate development leaders, same as most do with the vc community focusing on product and go-to-market synergies.” israeli cybersecurity maintaining momentum in 2018, investors became more domain-focused and preferred emerging fields. with traditional cybersecurity consolidating, emerging greenfields signal much stronger potential. furthermore, growth continued both in cybersecurity startups as well as their fundraising across all stages, indicating rising confidence in the israeli cybersecurity market. the 2018 israeli cybersecurity market boasted an excellent exit climate, highlighted not only by imperva’s large-scale acquisition but also by the diversity in the types of players in the space. as such, the local cybersecurity market signals its ability to create and nurture large-scale security vendors, thereby attracting variety of both international and local players which continue identifying and capitalizing opportunities in this domain. for 2018, as has been the case for many years past, the state of the cyber nation is strong–and 2019 appears to promise more of the same."
"in a move that’s both bold and bizarre, jetblue is introducing a new contest that will give three winners a year of free flights on the carrier. but entrance to the contest comes at a steep price. users must delete all of their instagram photos, post a new photo using a jetblue template and hope to be one of the lucky three. entrants must keep their instagram clear, and set to public, through march 8. on the one hand, the instagram-decimating contest may tap into some of the anti-social sentiment that’s cropped up over the past couple of years. in the wake of data misuse and privacy mishandling by facebook, which owns instagram, conversations around deleting social media and one’s own digital imprint have grown more frequent. plus, instagram has tools to let users download all of their photos. starting fresh on social media may be an attractive prospect to some people. on the other hand, instagram has been a modern-day photo album for many people, representing a place where they record the various steps of their life. for many, the request to delete their ig history is a very tall order. the situation is made more baffling by the fact that jetblue doesn’t really explain why you must delete all your instagram photos before posting their promotional garbage content. perhaps the carrier would like to replicate the same viral moment that #fyrefestival did with that burnt orange square. or maybe i’m falling into their trap as we speak, as a seemingly crazy request to delete an entire instagram history is inherently a bit of a publicity stunt. whatever the case, we all have a very first-world decision to make. what’s worth more: your instagram or the slim chance of free flights for a year?"
"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here: 1. facebook is the new crapware  well facebook, you did it again. fresh off its latest privacy scandal, the troubled social media giant has inked a deal with android to pre-install its app on an undisclosed number of phones and make the software permanent. this means you won’t be able to delete facebook from those phones. thanks, facebook. 2. the world’s first foldable phone is real  chinese company royole has beaten samsung to the market and has been showing off a foldable phone/tablet this week at ces. while it’s not the most fluid experience, the device definitely works at adapting to your needs. 3. ces revokes award from female-founded sex tech company outcries of a double-standard are pouring out of ces after the consumer tech association revoked an award from a company geared toward women’s sexual health. 4. everything google announced at ces 2019  google went all in on the assistant this year at ces. the company boasted that the voice-enabled ai will make its way onto a billion devices by the end of the month — up from 400 million last year. but what’s most exciting is the expanded capabilities of google’s assistant. soon you’ll be able to check into flights and translate conversations on the fly with a simple “hey google.” 5. rebranding wework won’t work  the company formerly known as wework has rebranded to the we company, but its new strategy has the potential to plunge the company further into debt. 6. despite promises to stop, us cell carriers are still selling your real-time phone location data last year a little-known company called locationsmart came under fire after leaking location data from at&t, verizon, t-mobile and sprint users to shady customers. locationsmart quickly buckled under public scrutiny and promised to stop selling user data, but few focused on another big player in the location tracking business: zumigo. 7. the best and worst of ces 2019  from monster displays to vr in cars, we’re breaking down the good, the bad and the ugly from ces 2019."
"google maps for ios will now allow users to follow their favorite businesses right in the app, the company announced today. the feature, which positions the platform as a challenger to facebook pages, lets users keep track of a business’s news and updates — like their sales, promotions or events, for example — through a new “for you” tab in the mobile app. the feature was previously available on android. this past fall, google rolled out the “follow” feature on google maps on android with little fanfare, beyond a brief blog post about the launch. but the feature’s significance shouldn’t be understated. google maps is one of the most-used apps in the world with more than a billion users. over the years, it has steadily expanded its feature set beyond just place search and navigation to become a tool to seek out new businesses, find restaurants and shops, read reviews, browse photos and much more. now, google is giving businesses a way to directly communicate with their customers, much like facebook does today. through a revamped my business app, also launched last fall, business owners can post content updates to their business profile on google. these are the same sort of updates that, previously, would have been published exclusively to social media — like the dates of a big sales event or a grand opening, for example. businesses can also use the my business app to track their customer reviews and respond to messages from google maps users in a centralized fashion. however, before today, the ability for google maps users to follow their favorite businesses’ updates was something that was only available on android. now, ios users can join in, too. starting this week, google is rolling out an update to the google maps app. now, ios users can search for a place — like a restaurant, store or anything else — then tap the “follow” button to keep up with the place’s news within the “for you” tab. and on the other end, businesses will now be able to see all their customers — not just those using android devices. the follow button is rolling out today, but releases reaching this large of a user base take time. you may not see the changes immediately, but should soon."
"after indicating that it was exploring its options for fighting the potentially deadly rise of anti-vaccination content on its platform last month, facebook is making a plan of attack. facebook’s strategy in the effort is to both minimize the spread of vaccination misinformation and to point users away from inaccurate anti-vaccination propaganda and toward “authoritative information,” i.e. info corroborated by the health and scientific establishment. to achieve a reduction in the spread of anti-vax propaganda, facebook will downrank groups and pages that spread this kind of content across both news feed and its search function. facebook will also reject ads promoting anti-vaccination misinformation. repeat offenders attempting to promote this content through ads may see their accounts disabled. on instagram, facebook “won’t show or recommend content that contains misinformation about vaccinations on instagram explore or hashtag pages,” effectively burying that content from public-facing spaces. facebook noted that it would also remove anti-vax adjacent ad targeting descriptors including the term “vaccine controversies.” facebook’s role in the rise of anti-vaccination or “anti-vax” conspiracy theories came into the spotlight last month. in light of reporting pointing to the responsibility of facebook and youtube in spreading this particularly dangerous form of misinformation, prominent california rep. adam schiff wrote to the two companies demanding “additional information on the steps that you currently take to provide medically accurate information on vaccinations to your users.” last month, bloomberg reported that facebook was “exploring additional measures to best combat the problem,” including “reducing or removing this type of content from recommendations, including groups you should join, and demoting it in search results, while also ensuring that higher quality and more authoritative information is available.” like other dangerous forms of online disinformation, the prevalence of anti-vax content has destructive real-world implications. the u.s. is currently experiencing an outbreak of measles, an entirely preventable infectious disease that is threatening the health of children and vulnerable populations and creating broad school closures in places like clark county, wash. when facebook directs its attention toward reducing the public spread of a particular strain of conspiracy theory or otherwise pernicious content, it tends to do a pretty thorough job. the problem of course is that such efforts from facebook and other major tech platforms remain reactionary rather than proactive, meaning that facebook’s next major outbreak of harmful, even deadly algorithmically fueled disinformation is likely just around the corner."
"at the end of 2016, plain vanilla founder thor fridriksson left the company he founded with the intent to take at least a year off of work. his product quizup, a social trivia game that raised more than $40 million and said it had more than 100 million users, never truly found a way to monetize. after a few missteps, including a proposed tv deal that eventually got cancelled, plain vanilla was acquired by glu mobile for a deal reportedly valued at $7.5 million. fridriksson was only a few weeks into his planned yearlong vacation when he became restless and asked a few members of his core team at quizup — gunnar holmsteinn, johann thorvaldur bergthorsson and ymir finnbogason — to start brainstorming with him about the future of mobile gaming. that’s where the seed was planted for what would eventually become teatime. “the main thing we kept focusing on, and it seems straightforward and common sense but these things often do in retrospect, is why people play games,” said fridriksson. “one of the main value propositions of playing a game is not about the game itself but about the human interaction you have while playing with someone — talking to the people you’re playing with and seeing their reactions.” teatime live is a mobile gaming platform that allows users to interact with one another, face to face, while playing games on their phone through a built-in video chat. on top of the video chat, teatime live offers users snapchat-style face filters called game faces, that are unique to each individual game on the platform. players can take their earned game faces from one game to other games, and eventually, fridriksson sees the opportunity for these items to be collectibles. most forms of games or sports have a social element built in. whether it’s board games or physical sports or even video games, players have been able to communicate with one another in some way shape or form. that simply hasn’t been the case on mobile, which means that it’s still unclear what the best possible game for this platform looks like. teatime is debuting the platform with hyperspeed, a simple racer game that the company developed in house. teatime will continue to operate as a studio and build out other titles on top of the teatime live platform, but it also plans to work alongside other game developers as a publishing partner. there are obvious concerns around enabling live video chat among strangers across the internet, and teatime has tried to take steps toward preventing abuse. to start, users are not allowed to play teatime games as a guest. all players must sign up with facebook, gmail or a phone number, which means bad actors will have a more taxing time getting back on the platform with a new username. more importantly, teatime’s game-face filters require facial recognition technology, which means that the system knows when there is no face visible in the camera. unless a user is playing with someone that they’ve friended, teatime will blur the picture whenever a face isn’t visible in the camera. as per usual, teatime also has a team of moderators going through profile pictures, etc. and a user reporting system. teatime hopes to build games around relatively proven models in mobile gaming to earn revenue on its own games, while sharing revenue with other game developers who build on the platform. teatime has raised $9 million in series a funding from atomico and index ventures."
"very rarely does an early technology garner such an air of inevitability like ar has in the past few years. 2018 was supposed to be a year where the foundational tech for augmented reality was built out a bit and the industry took a couple big leaps. things started off well-enough, but momentum really doesn’t seem be on the side of some of the industry’s heaviest hitters heading into 2019, suggesting that life for earlier-stage startups may not be much easier. there are plenty of reasons to be long-term bullish on ar, but the time horizons some have espoused seems to be bogus and pitch decks organized around a near-term spike in phone-based or glasses-based users are going to have a tougher time being taken seriously in 2019. the ghost with the most for all of the ar advances made this year, the company most emblematic of ar’s numerous challenges was clearly magic leap . the company spent the past few years trashing industry standards and lauding their own approaches with braggadocio, but ended up releasing a product that largely iterated on its competitors. with the release of their “developer kit” this year, a product that clearly seems to have stopped being a first-gen product only when the reality of the climate availed itself, the startup seems to be finding that optics and infra progress is going to come more slowly than foretold. i’ve talked to more than a few people who think magic leap hindered progress in the ar industry by siphoning investor attention and discouraging other hardware startups from joining the fray in the face of a billions-backed unknown. but in 2019, there are fewer available plays for the funding juggernaut. they spent years trying to distinguish themselves from the corporate mission of microsoft and their hololens headset; now it seems they’ve begun to see that the only hope of justifying their sitting valuation in the next few years is enlisting support from the big customers that msft is chasing, as opposed to single-handedly birthing a consumer market. magic leap recently lost a bid to microsoft for a $480 million military contract to outfit troops with ar headsets, and as microsoft prepares to release a second-generation hololens with the enterprise in full concentration, it seems like magic leap is going to reshuffle its deck. dead-on-arrival content plays magic leap’s struggles are well-documented, but what plagues the overall ar industry seems less discussed. the consumer appetite for phone-based ar content is obviously lacking. even apple’s reality distortion field isn’t enough to convince people that its arkit releases have led to anything other than some weird experimentation for ios users. few android oems are boasting about compatibility with google’s arcore platform anymore, suggesting that approachable hardware standards for device makers wasn’t all that was missing from the failed tango brand. the most apparent mobile ar opportunities are probably in user-generated content, but there seems to be a disconnect between platforms and users in terms of how complex these ar experiences can and should become. at this point, selfie masks still seem to be at the edge of users’ comfort levels, leaving a lot of solved tech problems stuck in limbo waiting for a problem that makes them worthwhile. niantic is probably one of the most revenue-heavy startups dabbling in phone ar, even if it is a bit of a false idol for the industry. nobody seems to think of niantic as a capital-a augmented reality startup, but it’s clear that the team behind pokémon go sees the technology as a not-fully-tapped reservoir of potential for future gaming experiences that feel more social and more immersive than any mobile rpg that’s sucking up the majority of your playtime today. the company’s new harry potter title still doesn’t have a release date, we haven’t seen any gameplay, but we do know that ar plays a part in the title in some capacity. we’ll see if they figure out things the rest of the industry hasn’t. platform tech opportunities part of this broader content pain is the fact that some known platform fundamentals are still getting tackled. in 2018, the startups in ar that were raising the most buzz were so-called “ar cloud” startups, teams that were largely focused on solving more fundamental back-end problems around localization and mapping. it turns out “simple” problems like getting a bunch of users in a single session or keeping track of objects you’ve moved around between sessions are actually incredibly complex. 6d.ai is building ar tech that crowdsources a 3d mesh of the world a big issue is that ar fundamentally relies on a level of spatial understanding that goes far beyond grasping geometry. for all the ground that has been traversed by computer vision researchers this year, issues like segmenting environments by objects and accurately identifying them are still in the earliest stages. when you think of ar tech as a subset of vision problems, you realize that products today are being approached in a kind of bizarre manner. google has been making worthwhile movements in proliferating their lens computer vision engine across new apps and devices. in a very roundabout way, the company seems to have come to the worthwhile perspective that mapping an environment spatially doesn’t really help that much if you can’t parse the contextual nuances of what the camera is actually looking at, as well. a lot of the ar startups in this space have raised some cash on the backs of the smartphone ar trend and the hundreds of millions of potential users, but it still seems pretty dubious whether this market has legs. fortunately, most of these solutions have wide applicability across future industries like robotics and autonomous vehicles, helping computers interface with the real world through visual and geographic cues, but their utility might not be as ripe as they’d hope. this is an area where magic leap could be poised to find some relatively near-term success. the startup’s top brass spent a hefty amount of time at their developer conference talking about the “magicverse,” basically their vision for bringing localized ar layers onto geographic spaces where users with magic leap glasses could observe the content. without having taken a peek at the tech they’re working with, their biggest advantage seems to rely on their partnership with at&t, which is poised to start working more seriously with 5g in 2019. the back end still remains a much more exciting market than hardware in 2019, but there may still be some interesting movement with devices this year. i don’t trust most of the predictive data that exists surrounding headset sales, so i’m not even going to reference it; suffice to say that ar headset sales aren’t going to explode anytime soon. north focals more conservative ar hardware one trend that i am curious to see shake out is the more simplistic version of ar where the glasses basically just offer users a heads-up display for notifications and lightweight apps. companies like north and vuzix have been talking a lot about their work here. apple’s rumored ar glasses have been talked about for ages at this point, with 2020/2021 seeming to be the rumor mill sweet spot for a release time frame. if that’s the case, i’d bet it falls more into this design ethos than a hololens type device. the hardware just isn’t small enough yet, but it is getting close, and there could be some interesting early ground that the industry could gain by moving in more heavily on traditional wearable use cases — though high component costs will be an early limiter as well. ar glasses startup north picks up intel’s vaunt patents this is probably a hardware space snap has their eyes on; spectacles jogged a lot of the current thinking on glasses-type wearables, but at this point, the company needs something that has wide appeal and can feed users back into its own app. the company isn’t in a position to hock something with razor-thin or non-existent margins, and it doesn’t gain that much from a product that sells a few thousand units in terms of building its platform. bottom line for the facebooks and apples of the world, immediate market conditions and user interest obviously hold a different weight. u.s. investment firms with good track records spent a lot of time this year rejiggering their expectations for their first waves of investments. for the more ambitious privately held ar startups of the world, there’s probably going to be an issue with raising capital this year, as a lot of the top hardware companies have been seeking more free-flowing late-stage cash from chinese firms, which have been growing harder to pin down as the trade climate worsens. this is going to be a problem for hardware companies especially. after $130m+ in funding, ar startup blippar collapses for the most part, the bs is going to continue to get easier to parse this year. platform plays are going to have to dial in their target audience a bit more than “everyone with an ar-enabled phone”; more realistic expectations are something the industry should benefit from. arkit and arcore are going to level-up and game engine-makers are going to get better solutions for ar content creators. back-end vision challenges are going to get solved and enable things like more seamless multi-player, but there are plenty of reasons why these tech problem solutions won’t lead to big changes in user behavior. users failing to take off in the second year of some of these big platforms probably won’t dissuade apple, but it definitely will dissuade some investors from continuing to bet big on the near-term future of mobile ar."

"we may have passed the peak of the “patent war” in the mobile industry, but the concept of patents as power is far from disappearing, since they continue to be a strong marker for how a company is breaking new ground in technology, and do sometimes help to safeguard an inventor’s or company’s original work — even if the legal enforcement around patents sometimes gets abused. patent research firm ifi claims today published its annual report on how patent grants played out in the tech industry in the past year, and it’s a mixed picture as well. it found that ibm has once again, for the 26th year running, topped the list, with 9,100 patents, followed by samsung, canon, intel and lg — also the same top five as a year ago. forty-six percent of all applications came from the us, with asia accounting for 31 percent and the us for 15 percent. but overall, the number of patents granted in 2018 dropped 3.5 percent over 2017, with many a company in the top 50 showing declines in their grants. notable declines included sony (ranking at 15) down 21 percent; google (number 11) down 16 percent, and qualcomm (number 8) down 12 percent. facebook, which last year made it into the top 50 for the first time, dropped out of the shortlist altogether. on the other hand, companies out of china on average saw overall gains across their patent portfolios. ifi’s larry cady said that it’s not clear why so many companies collectively saw significant declines — whether it was due to a lull in innovation — something that i’d argue might actually be happening in the wider industry — or a new approach to how a company safeguards its intellectual property, or even a more conservative process at the uspto. what he does note is that there is an average cycle of two years between pre-grant applications and grants, and these were down in 2016 and 2017, meaning 2020 may also see some declines. (applications were up in 2018 to 374,763, meaning the numbers will also bounce back for grants.) other notable trends: ford has really been driving up its tech cred with its turn to autonomous vehicle technology, jumping up five spots to become the only car company in the top 10. apple also moved back into the top 10 ranking, even as its overall patents declined by three percent. and ifi notes that if you combined all the subsidiaries of samsung, it would have actually surpassed ibm this year for overall patents held, or “ultimate patent ownership,” in the words of the ifi. samsung electronics has 61,608 active patent families, with canon in second position with 34,905 and ibm rounding out the top list with 34,376. unlike ifi’s annual top u.s. patent recipients, this broader ranking measures the size of a patent owner’s global portfolio based on the number of active patent families. a patent family is a set of patent publications filed around the world to cover a single invention."
"a final report by a british parliamentary committee which spent months last year investigating online political disinformation makes very uncomfortable reading for facebook — with the company singled out for “disingenuous” and “bad faith” responses to democratic concerns about the misuse of people’s data. in the report, published today, the committee has also called for facebook’s use of user data to be investigated by the uk’s data watchdog. in an evidence session to the committee late last year, the information commissioner’s office (ico) suggested facebook needs to change its business model — warning the company risks burning user trust for good. last summer the ico also called for an ethical pause of social media ads for election campaigning, warning of the risk of developing “a system of voter surveillance by default”. interrogating the distribution of ‘fake news’ the uk parliamentary enquiry looked into both facebook’s own use of personal data to further its business interests, such as by providing access to users’ data to developers and advertisers in order to increase revenue and/or usage of its own platform; and examined what facebook claimed as ‘abuse’ of its platform by the disgraced (and now defunct) political data company cambridge analytica — which in 2014 paid a developer with access to facebook’s developer platform to extract information on millions of facebook users in build voter profiles to try to influence elections. the committee’s conclusion about facebook’s business is a damning one with the company accused of operating a business model that’s predicated on selling abusive access to people’s data. “far from facebook acting against “sketchy” or “abusive” apps, of which action it has produced no evidence at all, it, in fact, worked with such apps as an intrinsic part of its business model,” the committee argues. “this explains why it recruited the people who created them, such as joseph chancellor [the co-founder of gsr, the developer which sold facebook user data to cambridge analytica]. nothing in facebook’s actions supports the statements of mark zuckerberg who, we believe, lapsed into “pr crisis mode”, when its real business model was exposed. “this is just one example of the bad faith which we believe justifies governments holding a business such as facebook at arms’ length. it seems clear to us that facebook acts only when serious breaches become public. this is what happened in 2015 and 2018.” “we consider that data transfer for value is facebook’s business model and that mark zuckerberg’s statement that ‘we’ve never sold anyone’s data” is simply untrue’,” the committee also concludes. we’ve reached out to facebook for comment on the committee’s report. update: facebook said it rejects all claims it breached data protection and competition laws. in a statement attributed to uk public policy manager, karim palant, the company told us: we share the committee’s concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. we are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform. but we’re not waiting. we have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. no other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do. we also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users. while we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. we have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse. last fall facebook was issued the maximum possible fine under relevant uk data protection law for failing to safeguard user data from cambridge analytica saga. although it is appealing the ico’s penalty, claiming there’s no evidence uk users’ data got misused. during the course of a multi-month enquiry last year investigating disinformation and fake news, the digital, culture, media and sport (dcms) committee heard from 73 witnesses in 23 oral evidence sessions, as well as taking in 170 written submissions. in all the committee says it posed more than 4,350 questions. its wide-ranging, 110-page report makes detailed observations on a number of technologies and business practices across the social media, adtech and strategic communications space, and culminates in a long list of recommendations for policymakers and regulators — reiterating its call for tech platforms to be made legally liable for content. among the report’s main recommendations are: clear legal liabilities for tech companies to act against “harmful or illegal content”, with the committee calling for a compulsory code of ethics overseen by a independent regulatory with statutory powers to obtain information from companies; instigate legal proceedings and issue (“large”) fines for non-compliance privacy law protections to cover inferred data so that models used to make inferences about individuals are clearly regulated under uk data protection rules a levy on tech companies operating in the uk to support enhanced regulation of such platforms a call for the ico to investigate facebook’s platform practices and use of user data a call for the competition markets authority to comprehensively “audit” the online advertising ecosystem, and also to investigate whether facebook specifically has engaged in anti-competitive practices changes to uk election law to take account of digital campaigning, including “absolute transparency of online political campaigning” — including “full disclosure of the targeting used” — and more powers for the electoral commission a call for a government review of covert digital influence campaigns by foreign actors (plus a review of legislation in the area to consider if it’s adequate) — including the committee urging the government to launch independent investigations of recent past elections to examine “foreign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation, and the sharing of data, so that appropriate changes to the law can be made and lessons can be learnt for future elections and referenda” a requirement on social media platforms to develop tools to distinguish between “quality journalism” and low quality content sources, and/or work with existing providers to make such services available to users among the areas the committee’s report covers off with detailed commentary are data use and targeting; advertising and political campaigning — including foreign influence; and digital literacy. it argues that regulation is urgently needed to restore democratic accountability and “make sure the people stay in charge of the machines”. “protecting our data helps us secure the past, but protecting inferences and uses of artificial intelligence (ai) is what we will need to protect our future,” the committee warns. ministers are due to produce a white paper on social media safety regulation this winter and the committee writes that it hopes its recommendations will inform government thinking. “much has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened,” says the committee. “this situation is unlikely to change. what does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. we need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data.” the report calls for tech companies to be regulated as a new category, “not necessarily either a ‘platform’ or a ‘publisher”, but which legally tightens their liability for harmful content published on their platforms. last month another uk parliamentary committee also urged the government to place a legal ‘duty of care’ on platforms to protect users under the age of 18. the government said then that it has not ruled out doing so. we’ve reached out to the dcms for a response to the latest committee report. update: a department spokesperson told us: the government’s forthcoming white paper on online harms will set out a new framework for ensuring disinformation is tackled effectively, while respecting freedom of expression and promoting innovation. this week the culture secretary will travel to the united states to meet with tech giants including google, facebook, twitter and apple to discuss many of these issues. we welcome this report’s contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the uk the safest place to be online. we will respond in due course. “digital gangsters” competition concerns are also raised several times by the committee. “companies like facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,” the dcms committee writes, going on to urge the government to investigate whether facebook specifically has been involved in any anti-competitive practices and conduct a review of its business practices towards other developers “to decide whether facebook is unfairly using its dominant market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail”.  “the big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,” it adds. the committee suggests existing legal tools are up to the task of reining in platform power, citing privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law — and calling for a “comprehensive audit” of the social media advertising market by the uk’s competition and markets authority, and a specific antitrust probe of facebook’s business practices. “if companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector,” the committee points out. “facebook’s handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms.” the social networking giant was the recipient of many awkward queries during the course of the committee’s enquiry but it refused repeated requests for its founder mark zuckerberg to testify — sending a number of lesser staffers in his stead. that decision continues to be seized upon by the committee as evidence of a lack of democratic accountability. it also accuses facebook of having an intentionally “opaque management structure”. “by choosing not to appear before the committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, mark zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the uk parliament and the ‘international grand committee’, involving members from nine legislatures from around the world,” the committee writes. “the management structure of facebook is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions. facebook used the strategy of sending witnesses who they said were the most appropriate representatives, yet had not been properly briefed on crucial issues, and could not or chose not to answer many of our questions. they then promised to follow up with letters, which—unsurprisingly—failed to address all of our questions. we are left in no doubt that this strategy was deliberate.” it doubles down on the accusation that facebook sought to deliberately mislead its enquiry — pointing to incorrect and/or inadequate responses from staffers who did testify. “we are left with the impression that either [policy vp] simon milner and [cto] mike schroepfer deliberately misled the committee or they were deliberately not briefed by senior executives at facebook about the extent of russian interference in foreign elections,” it suggests. in an unusual move late last year the committee used rare parliamentary powers to seize a cache of documents related to an active us lawsuit against facebook filed by an app developer called six4three. seized cache of facebook docs raise competition and consent questions the cache of documents is referenced extensively in the final report, and appears to have fuelled antitrust concerns, with the committee arguing that the evidence obtained from the internal company documents “indicates that facebook was willing to override its users’ privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers, to charge high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of that data, and to starve some developers… of that data, thereby causing them to lose their business”. “it seems clear that facebook was, at the very least, in violation of its federal trade commission [privacy] settlement,” the committee also argues, citing evidence from the former chief technologist of the ftc, ashkan soltani . on soltani’s evidence, it writes: ashkan soltani rejected [facebook’s] claim, saying that up until 2012, platform controls did not exist, and privacy controls did not apply to apps. so even if a user set their profile to private, installed apps would still be able to access information. after 2012, facebook added platform controls and made privacy controls applicable to apps. however, there were ‘whitelisted’ apps that could still access user data without permission and which, according to ashkan soltani, could access friends’ data for nearly a decade before that time. apps were able to circumvent users’ privacy of platform settings and access friends’ information, even when the user disabled the platform. this was an example of facebook’s business model driving privacy violations. while facebook is singled out for the most eviscerating criticism in the report (and targeted for specific investigations), the committee’s long list of recommendations are addressed at social media businesses and online advertisers generally. it also calls for far more transparency from platforms, writing that: “social media companies need to be more transparent about their own sites, and how they work. rather than hiding behind complex agreements, they should be informing users of how their sites work, including curation functions and the way in which algorithms are used to prioritise certain stories, news and videos, depending on each user’s profile. the more people know how the sites work, and how the sites use individuals’ data, the more informed we shall all be, which in turn will make choices about the use and privacy of sites easier to make.” the committee also urges a raft of updates to uk election law — branding it “not fit for purpose” in the digital era. its interim report, published last summer, made many of the same recommendations. russian interest but despite pressing the government for urgent action there was only a cool response from ministers then, with the government remaining tied up trying to shape a response to the 2016 brexit referendum vote which split the country (with social media’s election-law-deforming help). instead it opted for a ‘wait and see‘ approach. the government accepted just three of the preliminary report’s forty-two recommendations outright, and fully rejected four. nonetheless, the committee has doubled down on its preliminary conclusions, reiterating earlier recommendations and pushing the government once again to act. it cites fresh evidence, including from additional testimony, as well as pointing to other reports (such as the recently published cairncross review) which it argues back up some of the conclusions reached.  “our inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. the challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer,” writes damian collins mp and chair of the dcms committee, in a statement. “democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised ‘dark adverts’ from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including russia. “the big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights. companies like facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.” “these are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. the guiding principle of the ‘move fast and break things’ culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission. we need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,” he added. “the age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. the rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.” the committee says it expects the government to respond to its recommendations within two months — noting rather dryly: “we hope that this will be much more comprehensive, practical, and constructive than their response to the interim report, published in october 2018. several of our recommendations were not substantively answered and there is now an urgent need for the government to respond to them.” it also makes a point of including an analysis of internet traffic to the government’s own response to its preliminary report last year — in which it highlights a “high proportion” of online visitors hailing from russian cities including moscow and saint petersburg… source: web and publications unit, house of commons “this itself demonstrates the very clear interest from russia in what we have had to say about their activities in overseas political campaigns,” the committee remarks, criticizing the government response to its preliminary report for claiming there’s no evidence of “successful” russian interference in uk elections and democratic processes. “it is surely a sufficient matter of concern that the government has acknowledged that interference has occurred, irrespective of the lack of evidence of impact. the government should be conducting analysis to understand the extent of russian targeting of voters during elections,” it adds. three senior managers knew another interesting tidbit from the report is confirmation that the ico has shared the names of three “senior managers” at facebook who knew about the cambridge analytica data breach prior to the first press report in december 2015 — which is the date facebook has repeatedly told the committee was when it first learnt of the breach, contradicting what the ico found via its own investigations. the committee’s report does not disclose the names of the three senior managers — saying the ico has asked the names to remain confidential (we’ve reached out to the ico to ask why it is not making this information public) — and implies the execs did not relay the information to zuckerberg. the committee dubs this as an example of “a profound failure” of internal governance, also branding it as evidence of “fundamental weakness” in how facebook manages its responsibilities to users. here’s the committee’s account of that detail: we were keen to know when and which people working at facebook first knew about the gsr/cambridge analytica breach. the ico confirmed, in correspondence with the committee, that three “senior managers” were involved in email exchanges earlier in 2015 concerning the gsr breach before december 2015, when it was first reported by the guardian. at the request of the ico, we have agreed to keep the names confidential, but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior executives at facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case. the scale and importance of the gsr/cambridge analytica breach was such that its occurrence should have been referred to mark zuckerberg as its ceo immediately. the fact that it was not is evidence that facebook did not treat the breach with the seriousness it merited. it was a profound failure of governance within facebook that its ceo did not know what was going on, the company now maintains, until the issue became public to us all in 2018. the incident displays the fundamental weakness of facebook in managing its responsibilities to the people whose data is used for its own commercial interests. responding to the full report in a statement, uk information commissioner elizabeth denham said: the dcms inquiry has been vital to understanding the increasingly complex era of digital political campaigning, big data and disinformation online and we have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to it. we’re pleased with the committee’s support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. the ico’s investigations into these areas continue and we’ll be reviewing the full report with interest. we also support the report’s references to the growing public debate on internet harms. personal data, and its use for all forms of micro-targeting, is central to the work of the ico. we welcome the debate on how best to protect people online and we look forward to the proposals in the government’s online harms white paper. this report was updated with comment from facebook, the uk government and the ico"
"the rapid rise of slack has ushered in a new wave of apps, all aiming to solve one challenge: creating a user-friendly platform where coworkers can have productive conversations. many of these are based around real-time notifications and “instant” messaging, but today a new startup called threads coming out of stealth to address the other side of the coin: a platform for asynchronous communication that is less time-sensitive, and creating coherent narratives out of those conversations. armed with $10.5 million in funding led by sequoia, the company is launching a beta of its service today. rousseau kazi, the startup’s ceo who co-founded threads with jon mccord, mark rich and suman venkataswamy, cut his social teeth working for six years at facebook (with a resulting number of patents to his name around the mechanics of social networking), says that the mission of threads is to become more inclusive when it comes to online conversations. “after a certain number of people get involved in an online discussion, conversations just break and messaging becomes chaotic,” he said. (mccord and rich are also facebook engineering alums, while venkataswamy is a bright roll alum.) and if you have ever used twitter, or even been in a popular channel in slack, you will understand what he is talking about. when too many people begin to talk, the conversation gets very noisy and it can mean losing the “thread” of what is being discussed, and seeing conversation lurch from one topic to another, often losing track of important information in the process. there is an argument to be made for whether a platform that was built for real-time information is capable of handling a difference kind of cadence. twitter, as it happens, is trying to figure that out right now. slack, meanwhile, has itself introduced threaded comments to try to address this too — although the practical application of its own threading feature is not actually very user friendly. threads’ answer is to view its purpose as addressing the benefit of “asynchronous” conversation. to start, those who want to start threads first register as organizations on the platform. then, those who are working on a project or in a specific team creates a “space” for themselves within that org. you can then start threads within those spaces. and when a problem has been solved or the conversation has come to a conclusion, the last comment gets marked as the conclusion. the idea is that topics and conversations that can stretch out over hours, days or even longer, around specific topics. threads doeesn’t want to be the place you go for red alerts or urgent requests, but where you go when you have thoughts about a work-related subject and how to tackle it. [gallery ids=""1789615,1789614,1789613,1789612,1789611,1789609,1789608,1789607,1789606""] these resulting threads, when completed or when in progress, can in turn be looked at as straight conversations, or as annotated narratives. for now, it’s up to users themselves to annotate what might be important to highlight for readers, although when i asked him, kazi told me he would like to incorporate over time more features that might use natural language processing to summarize and pull out what might be worth following up or looking at if you only want to skim read a longer conversation. ditto the ability to search threads. right now it’s all based around keywords but you can imagine a time when more sophisticated and nuanced searches to surface conversations relevant to what you might be looking for. indeed, in this initial launch, the focus is all about what you want to say on threads itself — not lots of bells and whistles, and not trying to compete against the likes of slack, or workplace (facebook’s effort in this space), or yammer or teams from microsoft, or any of the others in the messaging mix. there are no integrations of other programs to bring data into threads from other places, but there is a slack integration in the other direction: you can create an alert there so that you know when someone has updated a thread. “we don’t view ourselves as a competitor to slack,” kazi said. “slack is great for transactional conversation but for asynchronous chats, we thought there was a need for this in the market. we wanted something to address that.” it may not be a stated competitor, but threads actually has something in common with slack: the latter launched with the purpose of enabling a certain kind of conversation between co-workers in a way that was easier to consume and engage with than email. you could argue that threads has the same intention: email chains, especially those with multiple parties, can also be hard to follow and are in any case often very messy to look at: something that the conversations in threads also attempt to clear up. but email is not the only kind of conversation medium that threads thinks it can replace. “with in-person meetings there is a constant tension between keeping the room small for efficiency and including more people for transparency,” said sequoia partner mike vernal in a statement. “when we first started chatting with the team about what is now threads, we saw an opportunity to get rid of this false dichotomy by making decision-making both more efficient and more inclusive. we’re thrilled to be partnering with threads to make work more inclusive.” others in the round include eventbrite ceo julia hartz, gv’s jessica verrilli, minted ceo mariam naficy, and taskrabbit ceo stacy brown-philpot. the startup was actually formed in 2017, and for months now it has been running a closed, private version of the service to test it out with a small amount of users. so far, the company sizes have ranged between 5 and 60 employees, kazi tells me. “by using threads as our primary communications platform, we’ve seen incredible progress streamlining our operations,” said one of the testers, perfect keto & equip foods founder and ceo, anthony gustin. “internal meetings have reduced by at least 80 percent, we’ve seen an increase in participation in discussion and speed of decision making, and noticed an adherence and reinforcement of company culture that we thought was impossible before. our employees are feeling more ownership and autonomy, with less work and time that needs to be spent — something we didn’t even know was possible before threads.” kazi said that the intention is ultimately to target companies of any size, although it will be worth watching what features it will have to introduce to help handle the noise, and continue to provide coherent discussions, when and if they do start to tackle that end of the market."
"kenyan communications hardware company brck acquired the assets of nairobi-based internet provider surf and its u.s. parent everylayer in a purchase deal of an undisclosed amount in february. based in nairobi, surf is a hotspot service provider aimed at offering affordable internet to lower-income segments. brck is a five-year-old venture that pairs its rugged wi-fi routers to internet service packages designed to bring people online in frontier and emerging markets. with the acquisition, brck gains the assets of san francisco-based everylayer and its surf subsidiary, including 1,200 hotspots and 200,000 active customers across 22 cities in kenya, according to brck ceo and founder erik hersman. backed by $10 million from investors, including steve case’s revolution vc fund, brck plans to use its new resources to expand to an undisclosed east african country and is eyeing options abroad. “we’re looking at indonesia and starting our pilot in mexico next month,” hersman told techcrunch on a call from kigali. brck built its platform around providing internet solutions primarily in kenya and rwanda. in 2017, the company rolled out its supabrck product and paired it to its moja service, which offers free public wi-fi — internet, music and entertainment — subsidized by commercial partners. there’s not a requirement to click on or watch advertisements to gain moja access, though users can gain faster speeds if they “interact with one of our business partners…by doing a survey, downloading an app or watching an ad,” said hersman. in 2018, brck began offering supabrck devices to drivers of nairobi’s matatu buses for kenyan commuters to access moja. as of january, moja traffic is racking up 300,000 active uniques and 3.7 million impressions per month, according to hersman. there’s more on the deal and africa’s internet connectivity equation in this techcrunch exclusive on the acquisition. nigerian fintech startup teamapt raised $5.5 million in capital in a series a round led by quantum capital partners. the lagos-based firm will use the funds to expand its white label digital finance products and pivot to consumer finance with the launch of its aptpay banking app. founded by tosin eniolorunda, teamapt supplies financial and payment solutions to nigeria’s largest commercial banks — including zenith, uba and alat. for eniolorunda, launching the fintech startup means competing with his former employer, the later-stage nigerian tech company interswitch. the teamapt founder is open about his company going head to head not only with interswitch, but other nigerian payment gateway startups, including paystack and flutterwave, he told techcrunch in this exclusive. teamapt, whose name is derivative of aptitude, bootstrapped its way to its series a by generating revenue project to project working for nigerian companies, according to its ceo. the venture now has a developer team of 40 in lagos, according to eniolorunda, who spent six years at interswitch as a developer and engineer himself, before founding the startup in 2015. “the 40 are out of a total staff of about 72 so the firm is a major engineering company. we build all the ip and of course use open source tools,” he said. teamapt’s commercial bank product offerings include moneytor — a digital banking service for financial institutions to track transactions with web and mobile interfaces — and monnify, an enterprise software suite for small business management. on performance, teamapt claims 26 african bank clients and processes $160 million in monthly transactions, according to company data. though it does not produce public financial results, teamapt claimed revenue growth of 4,500 percent over a three-year period. quantum capital partners, a lagos-based investment firm founded by nigerian banker jim ovia, confirmed it verified teamapt’s numbers. “our cfo sat with them for about two weeks,” elaine delaney told techcrunch. teamapt’s results and the startup’s global value proposition factored into the fund’s decision to serve as sole-investor in the $5.5 million round. delaney will take a board seat with teamapt “as a supportive investor,” she said. teamapt plans to develop more business and consumer-based offerings. “we’re beginning to pilot into much more merchant and consumer-facing products where we’re building payment infrastructure to connect these banks to merchants and businesses,” ceo tosin eniolorunda said. part of this includes the launch of aptpay, which eniolorunda describes as “a push payment, payment infrastructure” to “centralize…all services currently used on banking mobile apps.” the company recently received its license from the nigerian central bank to operate as a payment switch in the country. on new markets, teamapt is looking to canada and europe with a specific expansion announcement expected by fourth quarter 2019, according to eniolorunda. teamapt’s ceo is open about the company’s future intent to list. “the project code name for the recent funding was nasdaq. we’re clear about becoming a public company,” said eniolorunda. more africa related stories @techcrunch facebook expands its internet

"every couple of months, i talk to an entrepreneur who is interested in building a marketplace for buying and selling app businesses (i.e. the actual ip and ownership of an app or other piece of software). these markets always seem to suffer from a lack of liquidity, and one reason why is that it’s really hard to know how much technical debt is latent in a codebase. first, the developer behind the codebase may not even be aware of the technical debt they have piled on. second, until a software engineer really understands a codebase, they are almost certainly not in a position to answer a question on technical debt authoritatively. that makes it hard to get third-party opinions on anything but the most simple codebases. this opaqueness isn’t unique to software though. we lack tools for understanding the maintenance quality of assets — physical or digital — across our economy. even when we do perform maintenance or hire someone to do it for us, it can be hard to verify that the work was performed well. how long does it take for an auto mechanic to truly evaluate the maintenance of a used car? you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. i was thinking about this challenge of evaluating maintenance when i read this deep dive into the economics of old housing by akron’s head of planning, jason segedy: it has been suggested to me, on more than one occasion, that indebted, college-educated millennials could be lured back to the city by selling them these old, poorly-maintained houses for $1.00, and having them “fix up the house.” people who say this do not have a realistic idea of what “fixing up” an old house entails—neither in terms of the scope of the rehabilitation work that would be required, nor in terms of the level of skill, time, and/or money needed to do the work. even in a low cost-of-living market like ours, $40,000 houses are generally not a “good deal.” they are almost always a liability. they are a ticking time bomb of deferred maintenance. they are an albatross. in his own case: all told, i have spent $93,400 on improvements to this house over the past 15 years. this works out to an additional $502 per month, above what i was paying in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. when you add all of that together, the total monthly cost works out to $1,439. […] the total monthly cost for the brand-new house? $1,444. which comes out to exactly $5.00 per month more than my 72-year-old house. maintenance is the secret challenge of any asset, physical or digital. we have been talking about the tappan zee bridge here a bit this week, and maintenance played an outsized role in forcing new york to spend even more money on a new bridge. from phil plotch’s book politics across the hudson: however, he also recognized that the authority probably put less money into the bridge after it decided to replace it. “when maintenance folks know that a capital project is under design and will soon deal with the problems they have been battling for years,” he said. “they often back down a bit and turn their attention and resources to other areas.” that didn’t work out so well: one of the reasons the thruway authority wanted to build a new bridge in the late 1990s was to avoid replacing the bridge’s deck. however, the environmental review process took so long that the authority had to spend $300 million dollars to do exactly that anyway — after five-foot-wide holes started opening up along the length of the bridge. back in the software world, we have gotten much better about quantifying test coverage over the years, but we still seem to lack any means by which to evaluate technical debt. and yet, technical debt from my limited experience is hugely determinative on how fast product features can be launched. it would be hugely helpful to have some sort of reasonably accurate grading system that said “this codebase is really up-to-date and clean” versus “this codebase is radioactive and run away from it.” right now, so much of product engineering seems to be making decisions in the dark and discovering software quagmires. there has to be a better way. why we can’t build anything? (part 5?) image from honolulu authority for rapid transit written by arman tabatabai we’ve been obsessed with the infrastructure crisis in the u.s. lately and the question of “why can’t we build anything?” in case you thought the california hsr shitshow was an isolated incident, think again. construction dive provided some more details around the doj’s subpoena of the honolulu high-speed rail project (honolulu rail transit) last week, which ordered the project leads to open up their books. just like in california, after decades of debate, hawaii’s project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. today, the project holds an estimated cost of around $9-10 billion, compared to initial estimates of $3-4 billion, and some academics and industry specialists are even saying that number is more like $13 billion-plus. the court order came just after a state-led audit found that much of the cost overruns could be tied to poor contracting, planning and management practices — just as in california. given the similarities here, it’s possible we could see the federal government try and pull back the $1.6 billion it had earmarked for the project if it doesn’t like what it sees. despite calls for infrastructure improvement, the feds seem to be taking a tougher stance on the use of fed funds for these projects. construction dive also highlighted that the $650 million renovation of denver international airport’s jeppesen terminal was delayed indefinitely after operators found structural deficiencies in the concrete. sound familiar? maybe it’s because in just the last year we’ve seen “structural deficiencies” mar sf’s transbay terminal project and dc’s metrorail extension. denver’s reclamation project is expected to cost $1.8 billion in its entirety and is a year behind schedule after breaking ground less than nine months ago. india’s general election might also determine facebook’s future in the region westend61 via getty images written by arman tabatabai india’s parliamentary committee on information technology announced it would be meeting with facebook in early march to discuss “safeguarding citizens’ rights on social or online news media platforms.” the government has approached social media with a cautious eye ahead of the country’s huge upcoming elections, as concern over the use and misuse of social and messaging platforms in global elections becomes a hot-button issue. the topic came up in our recent conversation with the billionaire raj author james crabtree. he believes the election will be a hugely important period for social platforms in india. having experienced a number of major historical scandals, india’s citizenry has a fairly harsh — albeit somewhat selective — view on corruption, and crabtree believes that if facebook or others were to face blame for any alleged misconduct, the potential fallout from a political, regulatory and public opinion standpoint could be devastating. the prospect of such an outcome becomes even more alarming for foreign social companies as india has ticked up focus on data localization and movements towards a “national champion” policy that will increasingly favor domestic firms over external players. i love triangulation negotiation the trade kerfuffle between china and the u.s. is sort of just continuing at a glacial pace. literally glaciers, because greenland got involved over the past few months. greenland power politics is very far afield of tc, but i wanted to point out one little nuance that offers a worthwhile lesson. greenland has wanted to upgrade its airports for some time (there are no roads between major cities in the sparsely populated but huge country). but denmark, which greenland is a constituent country, has rebuffed those requests; that is, until the chinese got involved. from a wsj article: after kalaallit airports short-listed a chinese construction firm to build the new airports, denmark conveyed its alarm to the pentagon. after mr. mattis got involved, denmark’s government asked a consortium led by danske bank to help assemble an alternative financing package. officials in greenland were pleasantly surprised by the terms. “even chinese funding is not as cheap as this,” mr. hansen said. plus this quote: “he was not into it at all—until the chinese showed interest,” said aleqa hammon, greenland’s former prime minister, speaking of [danish prime minister] rasmussen. this is how you negotiate! get two larger adversaries lined up on either side of the line, and just start going back and forth between them. this works with google and facebook, sequoia and benchmark, or any other competitors. at some point, the game isn’t just a deal, it’s also the face-saving that comes from not losing to the competition. japan joining the trend of looser fundraising rules for growing companies written by arman tabatabai earlier this week, we talked about how security exchanges around the world were looking to loosen fundraising rules for young companies. the softening of these rules might be indicative of a wider trend, with japan now proposing revised rules to make it easier for startups to fundraise through traditional brokerages and trade shares of listed companies. while the motivation here may not be to attract ipo deals like it seems to be in the u.s. and china, with the creation of more funding alternatives and with companies opting to stay out of the public markets for longer, national securities industries seem to be trying to brand themselves as the best venue for young companies to grow. obsessions more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure and “why can’t we build things?” we are going to be talking india here, focused around the book “billionaire raj” by james crabtree, who we just interviewed and will share more soon. we have a lot to catch up on in the china world when the ec launch craziness dies down. plus, we are covering the next factory of the world by irene yuan sun. societal resilience and geoengineering are still top-of-mind. some more on metrics design and quantification. thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people, and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter?

"twitter is rolling out the redesign to its camera feature techcrunch reported on a month ago that’s designed to let you capture photos, videos and live footage and connect them to global conversations. starting today, when you swipe left from the twitter timeline, you’ll get the new camera that’s no longer buried in the tweet composer. after you capture some media (no uploads for now), you can overlay a location, hashtag or some words on a colored label. but what’s really special is that twitter will show this media in a larger, more immersive format in the feed with the imagery appearing before the text in your tweet. twitter isn’t launching stories or some dedicated feed of photos to rival instagram. but it wants to become a more real-time lens on the world rather than just an interpretation of it through people’s words. the enhanced camera could get more people shooting media, which could make twitter more accessible to new users daunted by walls of text. more visual content also makes it easier to slip more visual ads into the feed. see it? tweet it! our updated camera is just a swipe away, so you get the shot fast. rolling out to all of you over the next few days. pic.twitter.com/mooefo2nqq — twitter (@twitter) march 13, 2019 twitter tells me it’s not giving tweets created with the camera an algorithmic boost in the main timeline. but a spokesperson told me its combined human and technology curation team may seek to spotlight twitter camera tweets in the whats happening section about live events in the explore tab. we’ll see if media organizations and brands try to take advantage of the new camera to stand out in the feed. when you swipe left on the timeline, you’ll see a snapchat-style camera shutter button that records photos with a tap and looping videos up to two minutes long if you hold. a mini-swipe over and you can record video or audio-only live broadcasts without any periscope branding (will that app just become twitter live?). twitter will then recommend hashtags based on big nearby events and other signals, or you can add your own as well as a location and text. you can choose between six colors for the tv news-style chyron overlayed on those tags that help twitter route the content into the imagery carousels for its different what’s happening sections. for now, there are no stickers, filters, light enhancements or other creative tools in the twitter camera the way there is in the image uploader in the tweet composer (which conveniently also hosts a shortcut to the new camera). twitter tells me it wants to focus on tags that will pipe content into the right conversations instead of beautifying the media. that’s a different tack than youtube, which just started rolling out augmented reality face filters. historically, twitter has been extremely slow to launch product changes for fear of disturbing its long-time loyalists. but twitter tells me it’s turning over a new leaf and pushing the new camera out the door even with rough edges so it can start getting feedback and iterating. that’s much closer to how facebook builds than the twitter we’re used to. the move aligns with the recent release of twitter’s beta prototype app twttr that launched this week. twitter seems to finally understand that waiting to perfect each feature and being scared to experiment has left twitter behind its rivals. people who love twitter can’t find the same hellscape of constant conversation anywhere else, and the new camera probably won’t change that. but shifting toward visual communication without debasing itself to chase the stories trend could make twitter more comfortable for a world that increasingly talks through images."
"timing is the single most valuable skill of the modern economy, but i would argue it’s the least understood and also the least practiced. capitalism is fundamentally about timing, since market competition is about finding opportunities before others. when should you start a company? what company should you start? when should a vc invest? when should you join a company? when should you switch industries? when should you back a candidate for public office? every single one of our professional decisions is about timing, and yet, we do so little to practice and perfect it. most employees only make 3-4 major career decisions in their lifetimes — hardly enough feedback for this skill to mature. anyone who has worked in a large company further knows that timing a product launch or a new marketing strategy has more to do with internal politics than reading market forces. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. most of us want to make more money and accelerate our careers, but the truth is that these opportunities are few and far between. most jobs have limited growth potential. most startups die. most vcs don’t make money. most political candidates fail to get elected. the difference between success and failure sometimes has to do with hard work and tenacity, but far more often with the strategy of timing. it’s obvious that we can be too late to these decisions, of course. we can miss the round of financing, we can start a company a year or two behind someone else and lose the first-mover advantage. but we can also be way too early, ahead of the market and losing out on alternative opportunities that might have been more valuable. now, some perceive that “timing” is synonymous with “luck.” there is some truth there, in the sense that life is random and sometimes — completely unintentionally — people stumble upon a treasure chest of gold. don’t be distracted by that, because there are also people who just seem to have timing nailed. there are engineers (i know because i have seen their recruiter profiles) who have joined three unicorns in a row in the first handful of employees. there are vcs who get a string of wins that is far from chance. there are ceos that always seem to guide their companies to the right place at the right time and drive their stock valuations up. we talked a lot about why we can’t build infrastructure in america. one of the challenges is simply timing: so many things have to happen at once for these projects to get off the ground, and most governors and mayors lack the timing skills required to get them over the finish line. how can you practice timing? start writing down predictions about people, companies and markets. check in with the companies you talked with a few years ago — how are they doing? ditto people you met a while back. start evaluating your predictions: were they correct? were they too early or too late? more importantly, start cultivating networks of friends who have a sense of pulse on the frontiers of the economy. that could mean someone at the edge of a new science (quantum computing or ai) or someone who gets marketing to new demographics or someone who tracks new regulatory and legal changes. find a peer group of people who get timing and practice it as a craft. between techcrunch today and my former roles in venture capital, i’ve had the opportunity to practice timing a lot. i have a list of companies that i would have backed, and some have turned into unicorns while others have ended up on the ash heap of history. i’ve predicted some trends well, while flubbed others. i’ve been way too early (a huge bias for me), and sometimes stupidly late. but all along, i am practicing that timing muscle. it’s the only way forward in capitalism, and it’s worth every investment you can make. mithril capital, management fees and vc strategic drift peter kim via getty images theodore schleifer at recode reported a rare deep dive into the internal intrigue at a prominent vc firm, in this case mithril capital. from the article: mithril had its best moment yet last week when a portfolio company, auris health, sold to johnson & johnson for more than $3 billion — returning at least $500 million to the fund. all appears well. but behind the scenes, a far different story has been unfolding. the late-stage investment firm has been a slow-burning mess for the past several months, angering current and former employees, limited partners, and, crucially, [peter] thiel himself, sources say. among the issues is the firm’s huge management fee … and i guess lack of expenses? the firm is likely collecting as much as $20 million a year in management fees, sources familiar with the figures say. we don’t know exactly how much the firm spends, but people close to mithril say they can’t imagine that the firm, given its staff size, is spending more than half of that on operational expenses. [mithril capital founder ajay] royan’s salary, like that of other venture capitalists, is not publicly disclosed. one limited partner called the fees, given the size of mithril’s staff, “outrageous.” what? i don’t understand this line of reasoning at all. the firm negotiates a fairly standard agreement with its limited partners, and then the lps are pissed because the firm isn’t spending the money on massive staff and large, expensive offices? the whole point of delegating investment decisions to a gp is to empower them to organize their firm to win deals and get stuff done. if — and it’s a big if of course — they can do that on the cheap, then why should an lp care at all? burn the management fee in a fireplace if it makes the deals happen. ajay royan told bloomberg in 2017 that mithril does not “charge excessive fees.” but he was not exactly known for being thrifty with management money. former employees describe friday catered lunches where costs could run over $100 per person, and royan was known internally for a “book ordering problem” — a former employee said that “unbelievable amounts of books” would be delivered each week to the office by amazon to maintain the firm’s extensive library. pro tip: take on the mantle of book editor for a major tech publication, and the publishers will mail you books for free. we get at least a dozen at the tc offices every week, which is why we write about books so often around here these days. alas, no $100 catered lunches. the wider story here though appears to be one of a firm completely strategically adrift. mithril is struggling to compete against ferocious competition in the growth-stage equity market. the best deals are obvious to dozens of firms, and the ones that are less obvious have huge risks attached to them that make it hard to write the big checks required. “[royan] literally did not want to compete. if there was a process or bidding war or something resembling a competition, he would just walk,” the employee said. “and he would just say, ‘i don’t want to outbid.’” mithril is hardly the only vc firm that is strategically adrift. every time i go back to sf, this seems to be the norm these days among venture capitalists. there is a huge amount of money sloshing around, and very few deals that are in that sweet spot between obvious and highly risky. startups either get three dozen term sheets or none at all, since every firm is walking around with the same frameworks and metrics in their head. it’s so rare to actually hear a vc strategy that isn’t generic capital, that has some differentiation on sourcing, and picking, and growing businesses beyond the “we invest in great companies.” vcs don’t like strategy because it means making choices, and making choices means saying no to certain things, and those things might be the next facebook. so they do everything, all the time, which really means they do nothing. and so we get book ordering problems and expensive lunches and weirdly angry lps. what a boring mess. quality tech news from around the web written by arman tabatabai carl larson photography via getty images south california is also seeing declining seed investment today, the los angeles economic development corporation (laedc) published its updated economic forecast for la and the southern california region. one interesting note in the report is an observed slowdown in early-stage venture investing. the report highlighted that while growth-stage investments in california were hitting record highs, total deal count and seed investing — both in terms of total seed dollars and seed deal count — were at their lowest points since 2012. the data points in la, southern california and the rest of the state seem to follow the trend of declining seed rounds seen in the rest of the country. while the topic is one we’ve previously discussed and one which has heated up in recent weeks with commentary from marc suster, fred wilson and others, it’s interesting to see the trend occurring even in more nascent startup markets. will “diet ca-hsr” even get done as feds look to pull back california funding the federal government announced that it would be pulling back $1 billion in funding that was slated for the california high-speed rail project through 2022, while also pursuing legal action to help recoup the $2.5 billion it has already coughed up. the federal railroad administration is arguing that the state’s updated plan — completing only a route from bakersfield to merced — is starkly different from the plan for which the funds were originally allocated. ouch. as stock exchanges compete to attract ipos, unicorns and investors win? it might be getting easier for companies to go public around the world. with ample late-stage capital keeping more companies staying private for longer, looser rules from the sec and the hong kong stock exchange may be on the way to help entice more ipos. in the u.s., the sec proposed allowing all companies to market themselves to investors before announcing ipos versus just those that fall under the agency’s “emerging growth” definition. across the pacific, bloomberg reported that chinese tech companies have been lobbying the hk exchange for a number of more favorable rules, including allowing companies to maintain extra voting rights and letting major shareholders buy extra stock in the process. with a serious number of chinese companies opting to list on foreign exchanges last year, the hk exchange might be feeling pressure to cough up concessions that could help them win local listings — especially if the u.s. moves forward with friendlier rules. how japan lost half its citizens with poor data the japanese government failed to pay out billions of yen in government benefits for years due to faulty data. if that wasn’t bad enough, nikkei asian review reported yesterday that the government is struggling to even locate roughly half of those who are owed since they don’t have their current addresses on file. as simple as it may seem, tracking the indebted is actually a tall task since citizens have changed residences, changed names, and since the japanese government has historically destroyed benefit applications (containing address info) after the period required to maintain them. at this point, it’s unclear whether everyone who is owed will even end up getting paid, with the japanese government now offering a prime example of how poor data maintenance and not just poor data collection can make a situation go from bad to a whole lot worse. can the race to build roads in southeast asia avoid development gridlock? as we harp on our “why can’t we build anything?” obsession, infrastructure development in southeast asia is continuing to heat up and everyone seems to want a piece of the pie. japan announced plans to further accelerate investment into infrastructure and urban development in the region — where china is also actively engaged — with initial expansion talks focused on cambodia and the philippines. at the same time, a newly unveiled government budget in singapore and the ongoing election in indonesia have brought infrastructure development strategies into the spotlight, with open debate on how these projects have been and should be funded. obsessions more discussion of megaprojects, infrastructure and “why can’t we build things?” we are going to be talking india here, focused around the book “billionaire raj” by james crabtree. we have a lot to catch up on in the china world when the ec launch craziness dies down. plus, we are covering the next factory of the world by irene yuan sun. societal resilience and geoengineering are still top-of-mind. some more on metrics design and quantification. thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter?

"twitter today is joining the podcasting arena. this morning, the social network is launching its first-ever podcast series with a new show focused on twitter’s advertising business, which it’s calling “character count.” the company says, for now, it’s testing the waters with five already produced episodes of around 25 to 30 minutes in length. it plans to wait to record more shows after getting the crowd’s reaction to the first few episodes, so it can make adjustments if need be. the podcast will be hosted by joe wadlington, a marketer at twitter who’s specifically supporting twitter’s business initiatives. each episode will involve talking to people behind the scenes of some of twitter’s advertising stories, including the monterey bay aquarium (@montereyaq), dropbox (@dropbox) and simon & schuster (@simonbooks). the companies will speak about how they built effective ad campaigns and why twitter’s audience mattered to them. the goal, says twitter, is to offer others in the industry a look into which brands are “doing it right on twitter,” and potentially spark more brands to do the same. the launch of the podcast arrives when twitter is trying to shift wall street’s attention away from the network’s stagnant user growth. twitter recently said it would stop reporting monthly users, in favor of daily users, as a result of its inability to grow this key number. the change was announced in twitter’s q4 2018 earnings release, where the company said it had lost another 5 million monthly users in the final quarter of 2018, bringing its total down to 321 million. instead, twitter wants more attention on its ability to turn a profit from the users it does have — as it did in q4 for the fifth quarter in a row, and the fifth time ever. its q4 revenues were $909 million, which were more than the expected $868.1 million and up 24 percent on the year ago quarter. advertising accounted for 87 percent of those revenues, twitter said. it’s no surprise, then, that twitter now wants to help advertisers learn from others succeeding in this space and grow that figure further. twitter is not the only company that’s tapping into the popular audio format of podcasting to talk to advertisers and marketers more directly. in january, facebook also launched its first u.s. podcast with a series focused on entrepreneurship — the larger, unspoken goal being to position facebook as a place where entrepreneurs come to advertise their business. and somewhat related, linkedin debuted linkedin live, a new video broadcast service that gives people and organizations the ability to stream real-time videos to groups in a sort of cross between youtube live and video podcasting, perhaps. twitter, like facebook and linkedin, will not be running other ads within its programming. that makes sense, as the podcast itself is effectively an ad for twitter’s business and advertising tools. new episodes will debut every two weeks on apple podcasts, google podcasts, spotify, tunein and stitcher."
"let me begin by saying that facebook’s crisis response pages do a lot of good. they are a locus for donations and offers of help. but that said, for the love of humanity, when something bad happens, please stop marking yourself safe on facebook. they don’t mean to prey on our anxieties. they mean to assuage them. but all they do is reinforce the incorrect notion that the world is a terrifying place where unpredictable awful things happen frequently; they worsen the problem by attempting to treat the symptom. consider, for instance, “the tornado in ottawa, ontario and gatineau, quebec, canada” a few months ago. as a former ottawa resident i have multiple facebook friends there. todd and jennifer marked themselves safe; but what about joe? stefan? stephane? what happened to them? yeah, they’re fine, thanks, because that region has a population of 1.3 million, and while it is a shame that six of them were hospitalized as a result of that tornado (which hit canada frequently) when you do the math you quickly realize that that is equal to one out of every 216,000 people. if a single person were hospitalized as a result of an incident in a single town of 216,000, would facebook call on every resident of that town to mark themselves safe? i mean, if facebook did do that, why, your feed would be a nonstop deluge of crises from which people are marked safe. the world would seem like a cauldron of terrors, and any unknown much too scary to venture into, full of things which might harm you and your friends and family. you would be fearful of other places, and maybe eventually, almost logically, by extension, people from other places, too. our brains are well known to weigh our fears based in part on how vivid they are rather than how likely they are. so we worry more about vivid events than actually fearsome ones. would facebook call on new yorkers to mark themselves safe if a terrorist attack killed 15 people in a busy subway station? of course they would. it’s not even a question, is it. but 15 is fewer than the number of new yorkers killed in traffic every single month. is facebook calling on new yorkers to mark themselves as “safe from cars” every month? of course not. that’s a laughable concept. but the risk of that is greater than the risk of any given new yorker being killed in that hypothetical terror attack. and – here’s the key – when facebook asks you to mark yourself safe, and reports that you’re safe to all your facebook friends, it may reduce some specific anxiety in the short term, but it does so at the cost of increasing generalized anxiety — about the world and everything in it — in the long term. there are of course some crises so awful, so huge, so widespread, that this no longer applies; where the risk to any individual is in fact much higher than, say, the annual risk of dying in a car crash. if facebook reduced its calls to mark yourself safe to such actual crises, then none of the above would apply. let’s hope that one day they ratchet down their anxiety-inducing algorithms and do just that."
"cxa group, a singapore-based startup that helps make insurance more accessible and affordable, has raised $25 million for expansion in asia and later into europe and north america. the startup takes a unique route to insurance. rather than going to consumers directly, it taps corporations to offer their employees health-flexible options. that’s to say that instead of rigid plans that force employees to use a certain gym or particular healthcare, a collection of more than 1,000 programs and options can be tailored to let employees pick what’s relevant or appealing to them. the ultimate goal is to bring value to employees to keep them healthier and lower the overall premiums for their employers. “our purpose is to empower personalized choices for better living for employees,” cxa founder and ceo rosaline koo told techcrunch in an interview. “we use data and tech to recommend better choices.” the company is primarily focused on china, hong kong and southeast asia, where it claims to work with 600 enterprises, including fortune 500 firms. the company has more than 200 staff, and it has acquired two traditional insurance brokerages in china to help grow its footprint, gain requisite licenses and increase its logistics in areas such as health checkups. we last wrote about cxa in 2017 when it raised a $25 million series b, and this new round is a bridge to a series c that takes the company to $58 million from investors to date. existing backers include b capital, the bcg-backed fund from facebook co-founder eduardo saverin; edbi, the investment arm of the singapore economic development board; and early go-jek backer openspace ventures. they are joined by a glut of big-name backers in this round. those new investors include a lot of corporates. there’s hsbc, singtel innov8 (of singaporean telco singtel), telkom indonesia mdi ventures (of indonesia telco telkom), sumitomo corporation equity asia (japanese trading firm), muang thai fuchsia ventures (thailand-based insurance firm), humanica (thailand-based hr firm) and pe firm heritas venture fund. “there are additional insurance companies and strategic partners that we aren’t listing,” said koo. rosaline koo is founder and ceo of cxa group that’s a very deliberate selection of large corporates that are part of a new strategy to widen cxa’s audience. the company had initially gone after massive firms — it claims to reach a collective 400,000 employees — but now the goal is to reach smes and non-fortune 500 enterprises. to do that, it is using the reach and connections of larger service companies to reach their customers. “we believe that banks and telcos can cross-sell insurance and banking services,” said koo, who grew up in la and counts benefits broker mercer on her resume. “with demographic and work/life event data, plus health data, we’re able to target the right banking and insurance services. “we can help move them away from spamming,” she added. “because we will have the right data to really target the right offering to the right person at the right time. no firm wants an agent sitting in their canteen bothering their staff, now it’s all digital and we’re moving insurance and banking into a new paradigm.” the ultimate goal is to combat a health problem that koo believes is only getting worse in the asia pacific region. “chronic disease comes here 10 years before anywhere else,” she said, citing an emory research paper that concluded that chronic diseases in asia are “rising at a rate that exceeds global increases.” “there’s such a crying need for solutions, but companies can’t force the brokers to lower costs as employees are getting sick… double-digit increases are normal, but we think this approach can help drop them. we want to start changing the cost of healthcare in asia, where it is an epidemic, using data and personalization at scale in a way to help the community,” koo added. talking to koo makes it very clear that she is focused on growing cxa’s reach in asia this year, but further down the line, there are ambitions to expand to other parts of the world. europe and north america, she said, may come in 2020. update 03/13 18:36: the original version of this article has been updated to not that the round is a bridge ahead of a series c, not a series c."
"facebook just announced its latest round of “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” this time out of iran. the company took down 262 pages, 356 accounts, three facebook groups and 162 instagram accounts that exhibited “malicious-looking indicators” and patterns that identify it as potentially state-sponsored or otherwise deceptive and coordinated activity. as facebook head of cybersecurity policy nathaniel gleicher noted in a press call, facebook coordinated closely with twitter to discover these accounts, and by collaborating early and often the company “[was] able to use that to build up our own investigation.” today, twitter published a postmortem on its efforts to combat misinformation during the u.s. midterm election last year. example of the content removed as the newsroom post details, the activity affected a broad swath of areas around the globe: there were multiple sets of activity, each localized for a specific country or region, including afghanistan, albania, algeria, bahrain, egypt, france, germany, india, indonesia, iran, iraq, israel, libya, mexico, morocco, pakistan, qatar, saudi arabia, serbia, south africa, spain, sudan, syria, tunisia, us, and yemen. the page administrators and account owners typically represented themselves as locals, often using fake accounts, and posted news stories on current events… on topics like israel-palestine relations and the conflicts in syria and yemen, including the role of the us, saudi arabia, and russia. today’s takedown is the result of an internal investigation linking the newly discovered activity to other content out of iran late last year. remarkably, the activity facebook flagged today dates back to 2010. facebook takes down more ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ linked to iran the iranian activity was not focused on creating real-world events, as we’ve seen in other cases. in many cases, the content “repurposed” reporting from iranian state media and spread ideas that could benefit iran’s positions on various geopolitical issues. still, facebook declined to link the newly identified activity to iran’s government directly. “whenever we make an announcement like this we’re really careful,” gleicher said. “we’re not in a position to directly assert who the actor is in this case, we’re asserting what we can prove.”"
"facebook has finally made good on its promise to let users unsend chats after techcrunch discovered mark zuckerberg had secretly retracted some of his facebook messages from recipients. today facebook messenger globally rolls out “remove for everyone” to help you pull back typos, poor choices, embarrassing thoughts or any other message. for up to 10 minutes after sending a facebook message, the sender can tap on it and they’ll find the delete button has been replaced by “remove for you,” but there’s now also a “remove for everyone” option that pulls the message from recipients’ inboxes. they’ll see an alert that you removed a message in its place, and can still flag the message to facebook, which will retain the content briefly to see if it’s reported. the feature could make people more comfortable having honest conversations or using messenger for flirting since they can second-guess what they send, but it won’t let people change ancient history. the company abused its power by altering the history of zuckerberg’s facebook’s messages in a way that email or other communication mediums wouldn’t allow. yet facebook refused to say if it will now resume removing executives’ messages from recipients even long after they’re delivered after telling techcrunch in april that “until this feature is ready, we will no longer be deleting any executives’ messages.” for a quick recap, here’s how facebook got to unsend: -facebook messenger never had an unsend option, except in its encrypted secret messaging product where you can set an expiration timer on chats, or in instagram direct. -in april 2018, techcrunch reported that some of mark zuckerberg’s messages had been removed from the inboxes of recipients, including non-employees. there was no trace of the chats in the message thread, leaving his conversation partners looking like they were talking to themselves, but email receipts proved the messages had been sent but later disappeared. -facebook claimed this was partly because it was “limiting the retention period for mark’s messages” for security purposes in the wake of the sony pictures hack, yet it never explained why only some messages to some people had been removed. -the next morning, facebook changed its tune and announced it’d build an unsend button for everyone, providing this statement: “we have discussed this feature several times . . . we will now be making a broader delete message feature available. this may take some time. and until this feature is ready, we will no longer be deleting any executives’ messages. we should have done this sooner — and we’re sorry that we did not.” -six months later in october 2018, facebook still hadn’t launched unsend, but then techcrunch found facebook had been prototyping the feature. -in november, facebook started to roll out the feature with the current “remove for everyone” design and 10-minute limit. -now every ios and messenger user globally will get the unsend feature. so will facebook start retracting executives’ messages again? it’d only say that the new feature would be available to both users and employees. but in zuckerberg’s case, messages from years ago were removed in a way users still aren’t allowed to. remove for everyone could make messaging on facebook a little less anxiety-inducing. but it shouldn’t have taken facebook being caught stealing from the inboxes of its users to get it built."
"sprint today announced it will support apple’s business chat — the new platform that allows businesses and customers to interact over imessage. according to the carrier, customers can now message a sprint customer service agent, get info about plans and other services, as well as look up store information in maps, safari and with siri during a chat session. the support from sprint comes after two other launches on the platform this week. td ameritrade said it will allow customers to fund their brokerage accounts using apple pay on apple business chat. and gubagoo said it will connect car dealerships with customers through business chat for viewing inventory, plus scheduling test drives and service appointments. apple has been steadily growing its list of supported business chat partners, and today has a number of big brands on its platform, which is still in beta. these include names like 1-800-contacts, dish, overstock.com, quicken loans, kimpton hotels, west elm, burberry, vodafone, wells fargo, credit suisse, jos a. bank, men’s warehouse, the home depot, hilton, four seasons, american express, harry & david and several others. the platform also supports integrations with customer service platforms liveperson, salesforce, nuance, genesys, inthechat, zendesk, quiq, cisco, kipsu, lithium, egain, [24]7.ai, contactatonce, dimelo, brand embassy, asapp, imimobile and messengerpeople, according to apple’s website. business chat was officially introduced at wwdc 2017, and is apple’s entry into the business messaging and chatbot space. before its arrival, customers would generally reach out to businesses through social media sites like facebook (e.g. pages and messenger, whatsapp and instagram) and twitter. but apple’s product gets the businesses even closer to the customer, as their chats can live alongside those from family and friends. plus, they don’t have to share their data with a third party. for consumers, reaching a business through imessage is also a bit easier at times. a company’s business chat profile is highlighted across apple’s ios platform in areas like safari, maps and spotlight, and via siri. this makes it more seamless to move from one apple app to an imessage chat, compared with having to seek out the business’s social media profile. it’s also less painful than having to dial a customer service phone number, in many cases — as sprint today pointed out. “more consumers are embracing quick and easy self-service and digital assistance versus calling customer service through an 800 line,” said rob roy, sprint chief digital officer, in a statement about the launch. “apple business chat is an amazing tool for our customers that makes communicating with sprint fast, easy and stress-free.” business chat has come at a time when the “phone” part of our smartphones is turning into just another “app” — and increasingly, a spammy and bothersome one thanks to spam calls. apple’s solution makes it easier for customers and businesses to move away from phone lines, while google is leveraging ai to handle spammers — and even place calls for customers through its google duplex technology."
"around 37 percent of americans were subjected to severe hate and harassment online in 2018, according to a new study by the anti-defamation league, up from about 18 percent in 2017. and more than half of all americans experienced some form of harassment, according to the adl study. facebook users bore the brunt of online harassment on social networking sites according to the adl study, with around 56 percent of survey respondents indicating that at least some of their harassment occurred on the platform — unsurprising, given facebook’s status as the dominant social media platform in the u.s. around 19 percent of people said they experienced severe harassment on twitter (only 19 percent? that seems low), while 17 percent reported harassment on youtube, 16 percent on instagram and 13 percent on whatsapp . chart courtesy of the anti-defamation league in all, the blue-ribbon standards for odiousness went to twitch, reddit, facebook and discord, when the adl confined their surveys to daily active users. nearly half of all daily users on twitch have experienced harassment, the report indicated. around 38 percent of reddit users, 37 percent of daily facebook users and 36 percent of daily discord users reported being harassed. “it’s deeply disturbing to see how prevalent online hate is, and how it affects so many americans,” said adl chief executive jonathan a. greenblatt. “cyberhate is not limited to what’s solely behind a screen; it can have grave effects on the quality of everyday lives — both online and offline. people are experiencing hate and harassment online every day and some are even changing their habits to avoid contact with their harassers.” and the survey respondents seem to think that online hate makes people more susceptible to committing hate crimes, according to the adl. the adl also found that most americans want policymakers to strengthen laws and improve resources for police around cyberbullying and cyberhate. roughly 80 percent said they wanted to see more action from lawmakers. even more americans, or around 84 percent, think that the technology platforms themselves need to do more work to curb the harassment, hate and hazing they see on social applications and websites. as for the populations that were most at risk to harassment and hate online, members of the lgbtq community were targeted most frequently, according to the study. some 63 percent of people identifying as lgbtq+ said they were targeted for online harassment because of their identity. “more must be done in our society to lessen the prevalence of cyberhate,” said greenblatt. “there are key actions every sector can take to help ensure more americans are not subjected to this kind of behavior. the only way we can combat online hate is by working together, and that’s what adl is dedicated to doing every day.” the report also revealed that cyberbullying had real consequences on user behavior. of the survey respondents, 38 percent stopped, reduced or changed online activities, and 15 percent took steps to reduce risks to their physical safety. interviews for the survey were conducted between december 17 to december 27, 2018 by the public opinion and data analysis company yougov, and was conducted by the adl’s center for technology and society. the nonprofit admitted that it oversampled for respondents who identified as jewish, muslim, african american, asian american or lgbtq+ to “understand the experiences of individuals who may be especially targeted because of their group identity.” the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, according to a statement from the adl."
"oculus co-founder palmer luckey isn’t in the vr hardware business these days since getting canned by facebook (he’s focused on smart border security at his new company anduril), but he still wants people to like the product he helped design. a couple of months back he detailed some of the rather intricate mods he had made to the company’s oculus go headset to better tailor the headset to his use cases. today, he’s showcasing a fix for an audio hardware issue in the original rift that he says is causing problems for some rift users, cutting off audio in the headset’s right headphone. affected users haven’t been left without audio entirely, but the process of using third-party headphones and a super-long audio extension cord to plug into your pc is cumbersome, to say the least. luckey goes as far as to refer to the issue as a design flaw with the rift headset; he also notes that oculus will repair faulty headsets under warranty but that he’s found that it’s also affected plenty of out-of-warranty rift owners. over the past few weeks luckey says he’s been buying from users headsets that had audio issues to get a full overview of the problem, and now he’s figured out a fix. luckey writes on his blog that he’ll ship a free repair kit to any users that have reported their issue. you can check out his post linked above for full details. luckey doesn’t work at facebook anymore, so why is he even bothering himself with this? from his blog post, it seems to be a little bit of founder’s guilt. “the oculus rift cv1 is not perfect. some issues are the result of carefully considered design tradeoffs, but others are design flaws that did not become apparent as such until well after launch,” luckey writes. “i am doing this because i feel bad for people who bought a rift from me and can’t use it properly anymore.” it’s very cool to see luckey continue to take ownership of a product that he helped create. facebook is preparing to release an update to the rift this year, but for users that bet on vr’s first-generation and are suffering from some audio issues it seems their headsets can keep plugging along with a little bit of tinkering."

"short-form video app tiktok has been growing in popularity across international markets, including in the u.s. where a merger with musical.ly has seen the app topping the app store charts. facebook and snapchat have been hastily trying to copy tiktok’s features as a result. a part of tiktok’s ambitious global expansion plan has been its more recent targeting of emerging markets — like india and indonesia — where the company’s quietly launched “tiktok lite” app has been gaining ground in the latter half of 2018. tiktok hasn’t yet made much fuss over its lite version, which actually consists of two separate apps. the first was launched on august 6, 2018 in thailand, but is now available across other primarily asian markets, including indonesia, where it’s most popular, as well as vietnam, malaysia and the philippines. this version of tiktok lite has grown to 5 million installs since its august debut. (it’s actually written with a lowercase “l” in “lite” in the play store, which is how you can tell the difference between this and the other app.) this version was also briefly live in india, brazil and russia, but now these countries are served by a separate lite app (written as “lite” with an uppercase “l”), which launched on november 1, 2018. this second version of tiktok lite has now become the larger of the two, thanks to india. it has around 7.1 million total downloads, according to sensor tower data. it has also now been installed across 15 additional non-asian countries, including egypt, brazil, algeria, tunisia, russia, ecuador, south africa, dominican republic, guatemala, kenya, costa rica, el salvador, nigeria, angola and ghana. combined, the two tiktok lite apps have gained more than 12 million downloads in around six months’ time, techcrunch confirmed with sensor tower. however, tiktok lite is not being heavily promoted at this time — especially when compared with the outsize marketing that tiktok’s flagship app has been seeing as of late. this advertising is courtesy of tiktok’s chinese parent company, bytedance, which has had an infusion of billions in outside capital recently. the company is valued at $78 billion, as of october. and it’s spending, apparently: e.g.: more expensive promotion of #tiktok, this time in #dubai. that 3 billion from #softbank won't last long at this rate #bytedance 🤑🤑🤑 pic.twitter.com/a12tumbghc — matthew brennan (@mbrennanchina) january 1, 2019 sensor tower found that more than half of tiktok lite’s downloads came over the past month, following tiktok lite’s return to india. combined, the two lite apps’ downloads reached around 6.7 million in december, which was a 158 percent increase over november’s 2.6 million installs, it said. despite tiktok lite’s growth, 12 million+ downloads is only a drop in the bucket when it comes to tiktok’s larger user base. this represents only 4.5 percent of tiktok’s downloads on google play since august 2018, and only about 3.6 percent of all tiktok downloads since then across both the ios and google play app stores combined. to date, tiktok’s main app has been downloaded more than 887 million times on google play. that doesn’t count the downloads from the chinese version called douyin, which is found on third-party android app stores. that means tiktok’s true install base is even bigger. bytedance itself had publicly said last july the tiktok user base had grown to 500 million+ monthly active users — a way of counting who’s regularly using the app instead of just installing it on their phone. given that facebook lite grew to 200 million users in less than two years‘ time, it seems like a “lite” version of tiktok, now one of the world’s biggest apps, could be doing a bit better than 12 million installs over a six-month period. the problem seems to stem from a variety of factors, including how tiktok lite is marketed in the play store. the app uses screenshots and a description that make it seem like it’s just another version of tiktok. but according to user reviews, people were disappointed to find it’s a consumption-only app. many have left reviews complaining about how they can’t make videos. they call it “fake” and “bad” as a result. tiktok would do better to clarify how its lite version is different, to eliminate this confusion. it’s common for major tech companies to offer a “lighter” version of their app for emerging markets where low bandwidth is a concern. these apps tend to be smaller in size, more performant and sometimes either have reduced capabilities or special features aimed at low-bandwidth users. google, for example, has a suite of light apps — the “go” edition apps — like gmail go, youtube go, files go, google go, google maps go and google assistant go. uber now offers uber lite. facebook operates apps like facebook lite, messenger lite and instagram lite — the latter which launched just ahead of tiktok lite, in fact. like most “lite” apps, tiktok lite clocks in at a smaller size — it’s only 10mb to 11mb (depending on the version) versus the much larger 71mb of tiktok’s main app. a rep for tiktok confirmed the company is now offering a lite version in some markets so users can choose a smaller app if they have concerns around data or the storage space on their phone. no other information about the lite versions or strategy was provided. so far, bytedance’s efforts around tiktok lite seem more experimental, given it hasn’t put up a proper description on google play, runs two separate lite versions and had offered the app in some markets briefly, pulled out, then returned with another version. it will be interesting to see what tiktok lite becomes when it gets the sort of attention that the main tiktok app is receiving today."
"a report by the lead data watchdog for a large number of tech giants operating in europe shows a significant increase in privacy complaints and data breach notifications since the region’s updated privacy framework came into force last may. the irish data protection commission (dpc)’s annual report, published today, covers the period may 25, aka the day the eu’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) came into force, to december 31 2018 and shows the dpc received more than double the amount of complaints post-gdpr vs the first portion of 2018 prior to the new regime coming in: with 2,864 and 1,249 complaints received respectively. that makes a total of 4,113 complaints for full year 2018 (vs just 2,642 for 2017). which is a year on year increase of 36 per cent. but the increase pre- and post-gdpr is even greater — 56 per cent — suggesting the regulation is working as intended by building momentum and support for individuals to exercise their fundamental rights. “the phenomenon that is the [gdpr] has demonstrated one thing above all else: people’s interest in and appetite for understanding and controlling use of their personal data is anything but a reflection of apathy and fatalism,” writes helen dixon, ireland’s commissioner for data protection. she adds that the rise in the number of complaints and queries to dpas across the eu since may 25 demonstrates “a new level of mobilisation to action on the part of individuals to tackle what they see as misuse or failure to adequately explain what is being done with their data”. while europe has had online privacy rules since 1995 a weak regime of enforcement essentially allowed them to be ignored for decades — and internet companies to grab and exploit web users’ data without full regard and respect for european’s privacy rights. but regulators hit the reset button last year. and ireland’s data watchdog is an especially interesting agency to watch if you’re interested in assessing how gdpr is working, given how many tech giants have chosen to place their international data flows under the irish dpc’s supervision. more cross-border complaints “the role places an important duty on the dpc to safeguard the data protection rights of hundreds of millions of individuals across the eu, a duty that the gdpr requires the dpc to fulfil in cooperation with other supervisory authorities,” the dpc writes in the report, discussing its role of supervisory authority for multiple tech multinationals and acknowledging both a “greatly expanded role under the gdpr” and a “significantly increased workload”. a breakdown of gdpr vs data protection act 1998 complaint types over the report period suggests complaints targeted at multinational entities have leapt up under the new dp regime. for some complaint types the old rules resulted in just 2 per cent of complaints being targeted at multinationals vs close to a quarter (22 per cent) in the same categories under gdpr. it’s the most marked difference between the old rules and the new — underlining the dpc’s expanded workload in acting as a hub (and often lead supervisory agency) for cross-border complaints under gdpr’s one-stop shop mechanism. the category with the largest proportions of complaints under gdpr over the report period was access rights (30%) — with the dpc receiving a full 582 complaints related to people feeling they’re not getting their due data. access rights was also most complained about under the prior data rules over this period. other prominent complaint types continue to be unfair processing of data (285 gdpr complaints vs 178 under the dpa); disclosure (217 vs 138); and electronic direct marketing (111 vs 36). eu policymakers’ intent with gdpr is to redress the imbalance of weakly enforced rights — including by creating new opportunities for enforcement via a regime of supersized fines. (gdpr allows for penalties as high as up to 4 per cent of annual turnover, and in january the french data watchdog slapped google with a $57m gdpr penalty related to transparency and consent — albeit still far off that theoretical maximum.) importantly, the regulation also introduced a collective redress option which has been adopted by some eu member states. this allows for third party organizations such as consumer rights groups to lodge data protection complaints on individuals’ behalf. the provision has led to a number of strategic complaints being filed by organized experts since last may (including in the case of the aforementioned google fine) — spinning up momentum for collective consumer action to counter rights erosion. again that’s important in a complex area that remains difficult for consumers to navigate without expert help. for upheld complaints the gdpr ‘nuclear option’ is not fines though; it’s the ability for data protection agencies to order data controllers to stop processing data. that remains the most significant tool in the regulatory toolbox. and depending on the outcome of various ongoing strategic gdpr complaints it could prove hugely significant in reshaping what data experts believe are systematic privacy incursions by adtech platform giants. and while well-resourced tech giants may be able to factor in even very meaty financial penalties, as just a cost of doing a very lucrative business, data-focused business models could be far more precarious if processors can suddenly be slapped with an order to limit or even cease processing data. (as indeed facebook’s business just has in germany, where antitrust regulators have been liaising with privacy watchdogs.) data breach notifications also up gdpr also shines a major spotlight on security — requiring privacy by design and default and introducing a universal requirement for swiftly reporting data breaches across the bloc, again with very stiff penalties for non-compliance. on the data breach front, the irish dpc says it received a total of 3,687 data breach notifications between may 25 and december 31 last year — finding just four per cent (145 cases) did not meet the definition of a personal-data breach set out in gdpr. that means it recorded a total of 3,542 valid data protection breaches over the report period — which it says represents an increase of 27 per cent on 2017 breach report figures. “as in other years, the highest category of data breaches notified under the gdpr were classified as unauthorised disclosures and accounted for just under 85% of the total data-breach notifications received between 25 may and 31 december 2018,” it notes, adding: “the majority occurred in the private sector (2,070).” more than 4,000 data breach notifications were recorded by the watchdog for full year 2018, the report also states. for the earlier 2018 period, from january 1 to may 24 2018, a dpc spokesman told us it recorded 1198 valid data security breaches — making the full year total 4740. the dpc further reveals that it was notified of 38 personal data breaches involving 11 multinational technology companies during the post-gdpr period of 2018. which means breaches involving tech giants. “a substantial number of these notifications involved the unauthorised disclosure of, and unauthorised access to, personal data as a result of bugs in software supplied by data processors engaged by the organisations,” it writes, saying it opened several investigations as a result (such as following the facebook token breach in september 2018). open probes of tech giants as of 31 december 2018, the dpc says it had 15 investigations open in relation to multinational tech companies’ compliance with gdpr. below is the full list of the dpc’s currently open investigations of multinationals — including the tech giant under scrutiny; the origin of the inquiry; and the issues being examined: facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “right of access and data portability. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the right of access to personal data in the facebook ‘hive’ database and portability of “observed” personal data” facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to facebook’s terms of service and data policy. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the facebook platform.” facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining whether facebook ireland has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining facebook’s compliance with the gdpr’s breach notification obligations.” facebook inc. — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining whether facebook inc. has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organizational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “commenced in response to large number of breaches notified to the dpc during the period since 25 may 2018 (separate to the token breach). examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” instagram (facebook ireland limited) — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to instagram’s terms of use and data policy. examining whether instagram has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the instagram platform.” whatsapp ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to whatsapp’s terms of service and privacy policy. examining whether whatsapp has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the whatsapp platform.” whatsapp ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “transparency. examining whether whatsapp has discharged its gdpr transparency obligations with regard to the provision of information and the transparency of that information to both users and non-users of whatsapp’s services, including information provided to data subjects about the processing of information between whatsapp and other facebook companies.” twitter international company — complaint-based inquiry: “right of access. examining whether twitter has discharged its obligations in respect of the right of access to links accessed on twitter.” twitter international company — own-volition inquiry: “commenced in response to the large number of breaches notified to the dpc during the period since 25 may 2018. examining whether twitter has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” linkedin ireland unlimited company — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether linkedin has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” apple distribution international — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether apple has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” apple distribution international — complaint-based inquiry: “transparency. examining whether apple has discharged its gdpr transparency obligations in respect of the information contained in its privacy policy and online documents regarding the processing of personal data of users of its services.” “the dpc’s role in supervising the data-processing operations of the numerous large data-rich multinational companies — including technology internet and social media companies — with eu headquarters located in ireland changed immeasurably on 25 may 2018,” the watchdog acknowledges. “for many, including apple, facebook, microsoft, twitter, dropbox, airbnb, linkedin, oath [disclosure: techcrunch is owned by verizon media group; aka oath/aol], whatsapp, mtch technology and yelp, the dpc acts as lead supervisory authority under the gdpr oss [one-stop shop] facility.” the dpc notes in the report that between may 25 and december 31 2018 it received 136 cross-border processing complaints through the regulation’s oss mechanism (i.e. which had been lodged by individuals with other eu data protection authorities). a breakdown of these (likely) tech giant focused gdpr complaints shows a strong focus on consent, right of erasure, right of access and the lawfulness of data processing: breakdown of cross-border complaint types received by the dpc under gdpr’s oss mechanism while the irish dpc acts as the lead supervisor for many high profile gdpr complaints which relate to how tech giants are handling people’s data, it’s worth emphasizing that the oss mechanism does not mean ireland is sitting in sole judgement on silicon valley’s giants’ rights incursions in europe. the mechanism allows for other dpas to be involved in these cross-border complaints. and the european data protection board, the body that works with all the eu member states’ dpas to help ensure consistent application of the regulation, can trigger a dispute resolution process if a lead agency considers it cannot implement a concerned agency objection. the aim is to work against forum shopping. in a section on “eu cooperation”, the dpc further writes: our fellow eu regulators, alongside whom we sit on the european data protection board (edpb), follow the activities and results of the irish dpc closely, given that a significant number of people in every eu member state are potentially impacted by processing activities of the internet companies located in ireland. edpb activity is intense, with monthly plenary meetings and a new system of online data sharing in relation to cross-border processing cases rolled out between the authorities. the dpc has led on the development of edpb guidance on arrangements for codes of conduct under the gdpr and these should be approved and published by the edpb in q1 of 2019. the dpc looks forward to industry embracing codes of conduct and raising the bar in individual sectors in terms of standards of data protection and transparency. codes of conduct are important because they will more comprehensively reflect the context and reality of data-processing activities in a given sector and provide clarity to those who sign up to the standards that need to be attained in addition to external monitoring by an independent body. it is clarity of standards that will drive real results. over the reported period the watchdog also reveals that it issued 23 formal requests seeking detailed information on compliance with various aspects of the gdpr from tech giants, noting too that since may 25 it has engaged with platforms on “a broad range of issues” — citing the following examples to give a flavor of these concerns: google on the processing of location data facebook on issues such as the transfer of personal data from third-party apps to facebook and facebook’s collaboration with external researchers microsoft on the processing of telemetry data collected by its office product whatsapp on matters relating to the sharing of personal data with other facebook companies “supervision engagement with these companies on the matters outlined is ongoing,” the dpc adds of these issues. adtech sector “must comply” with gdpr  talking of ongoing action, a gdpr complaint related to the security of personal data that’s systematically processed to power behavioral advertising is another open complaint on the dpc’s desk. the strategic complaint was filed by a number of individuals in multiple eu countries (including ireland) last fall. since then the individuals behind the complaints have continued to submit and publish evidence they argue bolsters their case against the behavioral ad targeting industry (principally google and the iab which set the spec involved in the real-time bidding (rtb) system). the irish dpc makes reference to this rtb complaint in the annual report, giving the adtech industry what amounts to a written warning that while the advertising ecosystem is “complex”, with multiple parties involved in “high-speed, voluminous transactions” related to bidding for ad space and serving ad content “the protection of personal data is a prerequisite to the processing of any personal data within this ecosystem and ultimately the sector must comply with the standards set down by the gdpr”. the watchdog also reports that it has engaged with “several stakeholders, including publishers and data brokers on one side, and privacy advocates and affected individuals on the other”, vis-a-vis the rtb complaint, and says it will continue prioritizing its scrutiny of the sector in 2019 — “in cooperation with its counterparts at eu level so as to ensure a consistent approach across all eu member states”. it goes on to say that some of its 15 open investigations into tech giants will both conclude this year and “contribute to answering some of the questions relating to this complex area”. so, tl;dr, watch this space. responding to the dpc’s comments on the rtb complaint, dr johnny ryan, chief policy and industrial relations officer of private browser brave — and also one of the complainants — told us they expect the dpc to act “urgently”. “we have brought our complaint before the dpc and other european regulators because there is a dire need to fix adtech so that it’s works safely,” he told techcrunch. “the dpc itself recognizes that online advertising is a priority. the iab and google online ‘ad auction’ system enables companies to broadcast what every single person online reads, watches, and listens to online to countless parties. there is no control over what happens to these data. the evidence that we have submitted to the dpc shows that this occurs hundreds of billions of times a day.” “in view of the upcoming european elections, it is particularly troubling that the iab and google’s systems permit voters to be profiled in this way,” he added. “clearly, this infringes the security and integrity principles of the gdpr, and we expect the dpc to act urgently.” the iab has previously rejected the complaints as “false”, arguing any security risk is “theoretical”; while google has said it has policies in place to prohibit advertisers from targeting sensitive categories of data. but the rtb complaint itself pivots on gdpr’s security requirements which demand that personal data be processed in a manner that “ensures appropriate security”, including “protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss”. so the security of the rtb system is the core issue which the irish dpc, along with agencies in the uk and poland, will have to grapple with as a priority this year. the complainants have also said they intend to file additional complaints in more markets across europe, so more dpas are likely to join the scrutiny of rtb, as concerned supervisory agencies, which could increase pressure on the irish dpc to act. schrems ii vs facebook  the watchdog’s report also includes an update on long-running litigation filed by european privacy campaigner max schrems concerning a data transfer mechanism known as standard contractual clauses (sccs) — and originally only targeted at facebook’s use of the mechanism. the dpc decided to refer schrems’ original challenge to the irish courts — which have since widened the action by referring a series of legal questions up to the eu’s top court with (now) potential implications for the legality of the eu’s ‘flagship’ privacy shield data transfer mechanism. that was negotiated following the demise of its predecessor safe harbor, in 2015, also via a schrems legal challenge, going on to launch in august 2016 — despite ongoing concerns from data experts. privacy shield is now used by close to 4,500 companies to authorize transfers of eu users’ personal data to the us. so while schrems’ complaint about sccs (sometimes also called “model contract clauses”) was targeted at facebook’s use of them the litigation could end up having major implications for very many more companies if privacy shield itself comes unstuck. more recently facebook has sought to block the irish judges’ referral of legal questions to the court of justice of the eu (cjeu) — winning leave to appeal last summer (though judges did not stay the referral in the meanwhile). in its report the dpc notes that the substantive hearing of facebook’s appeal took place over january 21, 22 and 23 before a five judge supreme court panel. “oral arguments were made on behalf of facebook, the dpc, the u.s. government and mr schrems,” it writes. “some of the central questions arising from the appeal include the following: can the supreme court revisit the facts found by the high court relating to us law? (this arises from allegations by facebook and the us government that the high court judgment, which underpins the reference made to the cjeu, contains various factual errors concerning us law). “if the supreme court considers that it may do so, further questions will then arise for the court as to whether there are in fact errors in the judgment and if so, whether and how these should be addressed.” “at the time of going to print there is no indication as to when the supreme court judgment will be delivered,” it adds. “in the meantime, the high court’s reference to the cjeu remains valid and is pending before the cjeu.”"
"facebook is updating its privacy settings on android to make it easier for users to control what location data is sent to and stored by the company. in its announcement, facebook acknowledged that android users have expressed concern over the app’s ability to continuously log location data in the background. due to android’s all-or-nothing system of location permissions relative to ios, the facebook app has historically had the green light for collecting location data whether a user is actively in the app or not. while the company stopped short of admitting the practice, facebook for android users who previously had location services enabled can probably assume that facebook was extensively tracking their location even when they weren’t actively using the app. facebook describes the choice to toggle location history on as “[allowing] facebook to build a history of precise locations received through location services on your devices.” android users who previously allowed facebook access to their location data will retain those settings, though they’ll receive an alert about the new location controls. for users who kept the location settings for facebook disabled, those permissions will remain toggled off. while these changes apply only to android users, facebook also noted that it would send out an alert to ios users to remind them to reevaluate their location history settings. if your location history isn’t something you’ve thought much about before, it’s worth spending a minute to consider how comfortable you are with that depth of personal data being transmitted continuously to a company with facebook’s privacy track record. remember: once that information is out of your hands, you have little to no control over what happens with it."
"facebook has been called upon to provide good faith researchers with an api to enable them to study how political ads are spreading and being amplified on its platform. a coalition of european academics, technologists and human and digital rights groups, led by mozilla, has signed an open letter to the company demanding far greater transparency about how facebook’s platform distributes and amplifies political ads ahead of elections to the european parliament which will take place in may. we’ve reached out to facebook for a reaction to the open letter. the company had already announced it will launch some of its self-styled ‘election security’ measures in the eu before then — specifically an authorization and transparency system for political ads. last month its new global comms guy — former european politician and one time uk deputy prime minister, nick clegg — also announced that, from next month, it will have human-staffed operations centers up and running to monitor how localised political news gets distributed on its platform, with one of the centers located within the eu, in dublin, ireland. but signatories to the letter argue the company’s heavily pr’ed political ad transparency measures don’t go far enough. they also point out that some of the steps facebook has taken have blocked independent efforts to monitor its political ad transparency claims. last month the guardian reported on changes facebook had made to its platform that restricted the ability of an external political transparency campaign group, called whotargetsme, to monitor and track the flow of political ads on its platform. the uk-based campaign group is one of more than 30 groups that have signed the open letter — calling for facebook to stop what they couch as “harassment of good faith researchers who are building tools to provide greater transparency into the advertising on your platform”. other signatories include the center for democracy and technology, the open data institute and reporters without borders. “by restricting access to advertising transparency tools available to facebook users, you are undermining transparency, eliminating the choice of your users to install tools that help them analyse political ads, and wielding control over good faith researchers who try to review data on the platform,” they write. “your alternative to these third party tools provides simple keyword search functionality and does not provide the level of data access necessary for meaningful transparency.” the letter calls on facebook to roll out “a functional, open ad archive api that enables advanced research and development of tools that analyse political ads served to facebook users in the eu” — and do so by april 1, to enable external developers to have enough time to build transparency tools before the eu elections. signatories also urge the company to ensure that all political ads are “clearly distinguished from other content”, as well as being accompanied by “key targeting criteria such as sponsor identity and amount spent on the platform in all eu countries”. last year uk policymakers investigating the democratic impacts of online disinformation pressed facebook on the issue of what the information it provides users about the targeting criteria for political ads. they also asked the company why it doesn’t offer users a complete opt-out from receiving political ads. facebook’s cto mike schroepfer was unable — or unwilling — to provide clear answers, instead choosing to deflect questions by reiterating the tidbits of data that facebook has decided it will provide. close to a year later and facebook users in the majority of european markets are still waiting for even a basic layer of political transparency, as the company has been allowed to continue self regulating at its own pace and — crucially — by getting to define what ‘transparency’ means (and therefore how much of the stuff users get). facebook launched some of these self-styled political ad transparency measures in the uk last fall — adding ‘paid for by’ disclaimers, and saying ads would be retained in an archive for seven years. (though its verification checks had to be revised after they were quickly shown to be trivially easy to circumvent.) earlier in the year it also briefly suspended accepting ads paid for by foreign entities during a referendum on abortion in ireland. however other european elections — such as regional elections — have taken place without facebook users getting access to any information about the political ads they’re seeing or who’s paying for them. the eu’s executive body has its eye on the issue. late last month the european commission published the first batch of monthly ‘progress reports’ from platforms and ad companies that signed up to a voluntary code of conduct on political disinformation that was announced last december — saying all signatories need to do a lot more and fast. on facebook specifically, the commission said it needs to provide “greater clarity” on how it will deploy consumer empowerment tools, and also boost its cooperation with fact-checkers and the research community across the whole eu — with commissioner julian king singling the company out for failing to provide independent researchers with access to its data. today’s open letter from academics and researchers backs up the commission’s assessment of feeble first efforts from facebook and offers further fuel to feed its next monthly assessment. the commission has continued to warn it could legislate on the issue if platforms fail to step up their efforts to tackle political disinformation voluntarily. pressuring platforms to self-regulate has its own critics too, of course — who point out that it does nothing to tackle the core underlying problem of platforms having too much power in the first place… the problem isn’t zuckerberg makes poor decisions on behalf of the public. it’s that he’s making them in the first place. — matt stoller (@matthewstoller) february 11, 2019 the facts about facebook update: in a statement responding to the open letter, attributed to rob leathern, its director of product management, facebook said: we’re committed to a new level of transparency to ads on facebook and encourage others to do the same. that’s why we’re planning to open the ad api in late march — at the same time as our already-announced program to label political ads ahead of the european parliament election — so people on and off facebook can analyze political ads and see them archived in a library for up to seven years. this work is important and part of our broader efforts to protect elections this year. we’re also bringing transparency tools for political ads to india, israel, ukraine, and globally in june."
"the tech industry has been called on to share data with public sector researchers so the mental health and psychosocial impacts of their service on vulnerable users can be better understood, and also to contribute to funding the necessary independent research over the next ten years. the uk’s chief medical officers have made the call in a document setting out advice and guidance for the government about children’s and young people’s screen use. they have also called for the industry to agree a code of conduct around the issue. concerns have been growing in the uk about the mental health impacts of digital technologies on minors and vulnerable young people. last year the government committed to legislate on social media and safety. it’s due to publish a white paper setting out the detail of its plans before the end of the winter, and there have been calls for platforms to be regulated as publishers by placing a legal duty of care on them to protect non-adult users from harm. though it’s not yet clear whether the government intends to go that far. “the technology industry must share data they hold in an anonymised form with recognised and registered public sector researchers for ethically agreed research, in order to improve our scientific evidence base and understanding,” the chief medical officers write now. after reviewing the existing evidence the cmos say they were unable to establish a clear link between screen-based activities and mental health problems. “scientific research is currently insufficiently conclusive to support uk cmo evidence-based guidelines on optimal amounts of screen use or online activities (such as social media use),” they note, hence calling for platforms to support further academic research into public health issues. last week the uk parliament’s science and technology committee made a similar call for high quality anonymized data to be provided to further public interest research into the impacts of social media technologies. we asked facebook-owned instagram whether it will agree to provide data to public sector mental health and wellbeing researchers earlier this week. but at the time of writing we’re still waiting for a response. we’ve also reached out to facebook for a reaction to the cmos’ recommendations. update: a facebook spokesperson said: we want the time young people spend online to be meaningful and, above all, safe. we welcome this valuable piece of work and agree wholeheartedly with the chief medical officers on the need for industry to work closely together with government and wider society to ensure young people are given the right guidance to help them make the most of the internet while staying safe. instagram’s boss, adam mosseri, is meeting with the uk health secretary today to discuss concerns about underage users being exposed to disturbing content on the social media platform. the meeting follows public outrage over the suicide of a schoolgirl whose family said she had been exposed to instagram accounts that shared self-harm imagery, including some accounts they said actively encouraged suicide. ahead of the meeting instagram announced some policy tweaks — saying it would no longer recommend self-harm content to users, and would start to screen sensitive imagery, requiring users click to view it. in the guidance document the cmos write that they support the government’s move to legislate “to set clear expectations of the technology industry”. they also urge the technology industry to establish a voluntary code of conduct to address how they safeguard children and young people using their platforms, in consultation with civil society and independent experts. areas that the cmos flag for possible inclusion in such a code include “clear terms of use that children can understand”, as well as active enforcement of their own t&cs — and “effective age verification” (they suggest working with the government on that). they also suggest platforms include commitments to “remove addictive capabilities” from the ux design of their services, criticism so-called “persuasive” design. they also suggest platforms commit to ensure “appropriate age specific adverts only”. the code should ensure that “no normalisation of harmful behaviour (such as bullying and selfharming) occurs”, they suggest, as well as incorporate ongoing work on safety issues such as bullying and grooming, in their view. in advice to parents and carers also included in the document, the cmos encourage the setting of usage boundaries around devices — saying children should not be allowed to take devices into their bedrooms at bedtime to prevent disruption to sleep. parents also encourage screen-free meal time to allow families to “enjoy face-to-face conversation”. the cmos also suggest parents and guardians talk to children about device use to encourage sensible social sharing — also pointing out adults should never assume children are happy for their photo to be shared. “when in doubt, don’t upload,” they add."
"in its latest monitoring report of a voluntary code of conduct on illegal hate speech, which platforms including facebook, twitter and youtube signed up to in europe back in 2016, the european commission has said progress is being made on speeding up takedowns but tech firms are still lagging when it comes to providing feedback and transparency around their decisions. tech companies are now assessing 89% of flagged content within 24 hours, with 72% of content deemed to be illegal hate speech being removed, according to the commission — compared to just 40% and 28% respectively when the code was first launched more than two years ago. however it said today that platforms still aren’t giving users enough feedback vis-a-vis reports, and has urged more transparency from platforms — pressing for progress “in the coming months”, warning it could still legislate for a pan-eu regulation if it believes it’s necessary. giving her assessment of how the (still) voluntary code on hate speech takedowns is operating at a press briefing today, commissioner vera jourova said: “the only real gap that remains is transparency and the feedback to users who sent notifications [of hate speech]. “on average about a third of the notifications do not receive a feedback detailing the decision taken. only facebook has a very high standard, sending feedback systematically to all users. so we would like to see progress on this in the coming months. likewise the companies should be more transparent towards the general public about what is happening in their platforms. we would like to see them make more data available about the notices and removals.” “the fight against illegal hate speech online is not over. and we have no signs that such content has decreased on social media platforms,” she added. “let me be very clear: the good results of this monitoring exercise don’t mean the companies are off the hook. we will continue to monitor this very closely and we can always consider additional measures if efforts slow down.” jourova flagged additional steps taken by the commission to support the overarching goal of clearing what she dubbed a “sewage of words” off of online platforms, such as facilitating data-sharing between tech companies and police forces to help investigations and prosecutions of hate speech purveyors move forward. she also noted it continues to provide member states’ justice ministers with briefings on how the voluntary code is operating, warning again: “we always discuss that we will continue but if it slows down or it stops delivering the results we will consider some kind of regulation.” germany passed its own social media hate speech takedown law back in 2016, with the so-called ‘netzdg’ law coming into force in early 2017. the law provides for fines as high as €50m for companies that fail to remove illegal hate speech within 24 hours and has led to social media platforms like facebook to plough greater resource into locally sited moderation teams. while, in the uk, the government announced a plan to legislate around safety and social media last year. although it has yet to publish a white paper setting out the detail of its policy plan. last week a uk parliamentary committee which has been investigating the impacts of social media and screen use among children recommended the government legislate to place a legal ‘duty of care’ on platforms to protect minors. the committee also called for platforms to be more transparent, urging them to provide bona fide researchers with access to high quality anonymized data to allow for robust interrogation of social media’s effects on children and other vulnerable users. debate about the risks and impacts of social media platforms for children has intensified in the uk in recent weeks, following reports of the suicide of a 14 year old schoolgirl — whose father blamed instagram for exposing her to posts encouraging self harm, saying he had no doubt content she’d been exposed to on the platform had helped kill her. during today’s press conference, jourova was asked whether the commission intends to extend the code of conduct on illegal hate speech to other types of content that’s attracting concern, such as bullying and suicide. but she said the executive body is not intending to expand into such areas. she said the commission’s focus remains on addressing content that’s judged illegal under existing european legislation on racism and xenophobia — saying it’s a matter for individual member states to choose to legislate in additional areas if they feel a need. “we are following what the member states are doing because we see… to some extent a fragmented picture of different problems in different countries,” she noted. “we are focusing on what is our obligation to promote the compliance with the european law. which is the framework decision against racism and xenophobia. “but we have the group of experts from the member states, in the so-called internet forum, where we speak about other crimes or sources of hatred online. and we see the determination on the side of the member states to take proactive measures against these matters. so we expect that if there is such a worrying trend in some member state that will address it by means of their national legislation.” “i will always tell you i don’t like the fragmentation of the legal framework, especially when it comes to digital because we are faced with, more or less, the same problems in all the member states,” she added. “but it’s true that when you [take a closer look] you see there are specific issues in the member states, also maybe related with their history or culture, which at some moment the national authorities find necessary to react on by regulation. and the commission is not hindering this process. “this is the sovereign decision of the member states.” four more tech platforms joined the voluntary code of conduct on illegal hate speech last year: — namely google+, instagram, snapchat, dailymotion. while french gaming platform webedia (jeuxvideo.com) also announced their participation today. drilling down into the performance of specific platforms, the commission’s monitoring exercise found that facebook assessed hate speech reports in less than 24 hours in 92.6% of the cases and 5.1% in less than 48 hours. the corresponding performance figures for youtube were 83.8 % and 7.9%; and for twitter 88.3% and 7.3%, respectively. while instagram managed 77.4 % of notifications assessed in less than 24 hours. and google+, which will in any case closes to consumers this april, managed to assess just 60%. in terms of removals, the commission found youtube removed 85.4% of reported content, facebook 82.4% and twitter 43.5% (the latter constituting a slight decrease in performance vs last year). while google+ removed 80.0% of the content and instagram 70.6%. it argues that despite social media platforms removing illegal content “more and more rapidly”, as a result of the code, this has not led to an “over-removal” of content — pointing to variable removal rates as an indication that “the review made by the companies continues to respect freedom of expression”. “removal rates varied depending on the severity of hateful content,” the commission writes. “on average, 85.5% of content calling for murder or violence against specific groups was removed, while content using defamatory words or pictures to name certain groups was removed in 58.5 % of the cases.” “this suggest that the reviewers assess the content scrupulously and with full regard to protected speech,” it adds. it is also crediting the code with helping foster partnerships between civil society organisations, national authorities and tech platforms — on key issues such as awareness raising and education activities."
"keith wright contributor share on twitter keith wright is a villanova school of business instructor of accounting and information systems, founder of simplicity on-demand llc and former senior vice president for global sales operations for sap. there is no question that the arrival of a fragmented and divided internet is now upon us. the “splinternet,” where cyberspace is controlled and regulated by different countries is no longer just a concept, but now a dangerous reality. with the future of the “world wide web” at stake, governments and advocates in support of a free and open internet have an obligation to stem the tide of authoritarian regimes isolating the web to control information and their populations. both china and russia have been rapidly increasing their internet oversight, leading to increased digital authoritarianism. earlier this month russia announced a plan to disconnect the entire country from the internet to simulate an all-out cyberwar. and, last month china issued two new censorship rules, identifying 100 new categories of banned content and implementing mandatory reviews of all content posted on short video platforms. while china and russia may be two of the biggest internet disruptors, they are by no means the only ones. cuban, iranian and even turkish politicians have begun pushing “information sovereignty,” a euphemism for replacing services provided by western internet companies with their own more limited but easier to control products. and a 2017 study found that numerous countries, including saudi arabia, syria and yemen have engaged in “substantial politically motivated filtering.” this digital control has also spread beyond authoritarian regimes. increasingly, there are more attempts to keep foreign nationals off certain web properties. for example, digital content available to u.k. citizens via the bbc’s iplayer is becoming increasingly unavailable to germans. south korea filters, censors and blocks news agencies belonging to north korea. never have so many governments, authoritarian and democratic, actively blocked internet access to their own nationals. the consequences of the splinternet and digital authoritarianism stretch far beyond the populations of these individual countries. back in 2016, u.s. trade officials accused china’s great firewall of creating what foreign internet executives defined as a trade barrier. through controlling the rules of the internet, the chinese government has nurtured a trio of domestic internet giants, known as bat (baidu, alibaba and tencent), who are all in lock step with the government’s ultra-strict regime. the super-apps that these internet giants produce, such as wechat, are built for censorship. the result? according to former google ceo eric schmidt, “the chinese firewall will lead to two distinct internets. the u.s. will dominate the western internet and china will dominate the internet for all of asia.” surprisingly, u.s. companies are helping to facilitate this splinternet. google had spent decades attempting to break into the chinese market but had difficulty coexisting with the chinese government’s strict censorship and collection of data, so much so that in march 2010, google chose to pull its search engines and other services out of china. however now, in 2019, google has completely changed its tune. google has made censorship allowances through an entirely different chinese internet platform called project dragonfly . dragonfly is a censored version of google’s western search platform, with the key difference being that it blocks results for sensitive public queries. sundar pichai, chief executive officer of google inc., sits before the start of a house judiciary committee hearing in washington, d.c., u.s., on tuesday, dec. 11, 2018. pichai backed privacy legislation and denied the company is politically biased, according to a transcript of testimony he plans to deliver. photographer: andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images the universal declaration of human rights states that “people have the right to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” drafted in 1948, this declaration reflects the sentiment felt following world war ii, when people worked to prevent authoritarian propaganda and censorship from ever taking hold the way it once did. and, while these words were written over 70 years ago, well before the age of the internet, this declaration challenges the very concept of the splinternet and the undemocratic digital boundaries we see developing today. as the web becomes more splintered and information more controlled across the globe, we risk the deterioration of democratic systems, the corruption of free markets and further cyber misinformation campaigns. we must act now to save a free and open internet from censorship and international maneuvering before history is bound to repeat itself. brussels, belgium – may 22: an avaaz activist attends an anti-facebook demonstration with cardboard cutouts of facebook chief mark zuckerberg, on which is written “fix fakebook”, in front of the berlaymont, the eu commission headquarter on may 22, 2018 in brussels, belgium. avaaz.org is an international non-governmental cybermilitating organization, founded in 2007. presenting itself as a “supranational democratic movement,” it says it empowers citizens around the world to mobilize on various international issues, such as human rights, corruption or poverty. (photo by thierry monasse/corbis via getty images) the ultimate solution similar to the udhr drafted in 1948, in 2016, the united nations declared “online freedom” to be a fundamental human right that must be protected. while not legally binding, the motion passed with consensus, and therefore the un was provided limited power to endorse an open internet (oi) system. through selectively applying pressure on governments who are not compliant, the un can now enforce digital human rights standards. the first step would be to implement a transparent monitoring system which ensures that the full resources of the internet, and ability to operate on it, are easily accessible to all citizens. countries such as north korea, china, iran and syria, who block websites and filter email plus social media communication, would be encouraged to improve through the imposition of incentives and consequences. all countries would be ranked on their achievement of multiple positive factors including open standards, lack of censorship, and low barriers to internet entry. a three tier open internet ranking system would divide all nations into free, partly free or not free. the ultimate goal would be to have all countries gradually migrate towards the free category, allowing all citizens full information across the www, equally free and open without constraints. the second step would be for the un to align itself much more closely with the largest western internet companies. together they could jointly assemble detailed reports on each government’s efforts towards censorship creep and government overreach. the global tech companies are keenly aware of which specific countries are applying pressure for censorship and the restriction of digital speech. together, the un and global tech firms would prove strong adversaries, protecting the citizens of the world. every individual in every country deserves to know what is truly happening in the world. the free countries with an open internet, zero undue regulation or censorship would have a clear path to tremendous economic prosperity. countries who remain in the not free tier, attempting to impose their self-serving political and social values would find themselves completely isolated, visibly violating digital human rights law. this is not a hollow threat. a completely closed off splinternet will inevitably lead a country to isolation, low growth rates, and stagnation."
"two years on from the u.s. presidential election, facebook continues to have a major problem with russian disinformation being megaphoned via its social tools. in a blog post today the company reveals another tranche of kremlin-linked fake activity — saying it’s removed a total of 471 facebook pages and accounts, as well as 41 instagram accounts, which were being used to spread propaganda in regions where putin’s regime has sharp geopolitical interests. in its latest reveal of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” — aka the euphemism facebook uses for disinformation campaigns that rely on its tools to generate a veneer of authenticity and plausibility in order to pump out masses of sharable political propaganda — the company says it identified two operations, both originating in russia, and both using similar tactics without any apparent direct links between the two networks. one operation was targeting ukraine specifically, while the other was active in a number of countries in the baltics, central asia, the caucasus, and central and eastern europe. “we’re taking down these pages and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they post,” writes facebook’s nathaniel gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy. “in these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.” sputnik link discussing the russian disinformation op targeting multiple countries, gleicher says facebook found what looked like innocuous or general interest pages to be linked to employees of kremlin propaganda outlet sputnik, with some of the pages encouraging protest movements and pushing other putin lines. “the page administrators and account owners primarily represented themselves as independent news pages or general interest pages on topics like weather, travel, sports, economics, or politicians in romania, latvia, estonia, lithuania, armenia, azerbaijan, georgia, tajikistan, uzbekistan, kazakhstan, moldova, russia, and kyrgyzstan,” he writes. “despite their misrepresentations of their identities, we found that these pages and accounts were linked to employees of sputnik, a news agency based in moscow, and that some of the pages frequently posted about topics like anti-nato sentiment, protest movements, and anti-corruption.” facebook has included some sample posts from the removed accounts in the blog which show a mixture of imagery being deployed — from a photo of a rock concert, to shots of historic buildings and a snowy scene, to obviously militaristic and political protest imagery. in all facebook says it removed 289 pages and 75 facebook accounts associated with this russian disop; adding that around 790,000 accounts followed one or more of the removed pages. it also reveals that it received around $135,000 for ads run by the russian operators (specifying this was paid for in euros, rubles, and u.s. dollars). “the first ad ran in october 2013, and the most recent ad ran in january 2019,” it notes, adding: “we have not completed a review of the organic content coming from these accounts.” these kremlin-linked pages also hosted around 190 events — with the first scheduled for august 2015, according to facebook, and the most recent scheduled for january 2019. “up to 1,200 people expressed interest in at least one of these events. we cannot confirm whether any of these events actually occurred,” it further notes. facebook adds that open source reporting and work by partners which investigate disinformation helped identify the network. (for more on the open source investigation check out this blog post from dfrlab.) it also says it has shared information about the investigation with u.s. law enforcement, the u.s. congress, other technology companies, and policymakers in impacted countries. ukraine tip-off in the case of the ukraine-targeted russian disop, facebook says it removed a total of 107 facebook pages, groups, and accounts, and 41 instagram accounts, specifying that it was acting on an initial tip off from u.s. law enforcement. in all it says around 180,000 facebook accounts were following one or more of the removed pages. while the fake instagram accounts were being followed by more than 55,000 accounts.   again facebook received money from the disinformation purveyors, saying it took in around $25,000 in ad spending on facebook and instagram in this case — all paid for in rubles this time — with the first ad running in january 2018, and the most recent in december 2018. (again it says it has not completed a review of content the accounts were generating.) “the individuals behind these accounts primarily represented themselves as ukrainian, and they operated a variety of fake accounts while sharing local ukrainian news stories on a variety of topics, such as weather, protests, nato, and health conditions at schools,” writes gleicher. “we identified some technical overlap with russia-based activity we saw prior to the us midterm elections, including behavior that shared characteristics with previous internet research agency (ira) activity.” in the ukraine case it says it found no events being hosted by the pages. “our security efforts are ongoing to help us stay a step ahead and uncover this kind of abuse, particularly in light of important political moments and elections in europe this year,” adds gleicher. “we are committed to making improvements and building stronger partnerships around the world to more effectively detect and stop this activity.” a month ago facebook also revealed it had removed another batch of politically motivated fake accounts. in that case the network behind the pages had been working to spread misinformation in bangladesh 10 days before the country’s general elections. this week it also emerged the company is extending some of its nascent election security measures by bringing in requirements for political advertisers to more international markets ahead of major elections in the coming months, such as checks that a political advertiser is located in the country. however in other countries which also have big votes looming this year facebook has yet to announced any measures to combat politically charged fakes."
"the reception to facebook portal has been, at best, a mixed bag. between the company’s ongoing privacy woes and a lackluster response, facebook likely didn’t get the response it was anticipating for its first in-house hardware creation. still, both the portal and portal plus are floating around the four-star mark over on amazon. not too shabby. new york times columnist kevin roose noticed something fishy in all of this, noting on twitter that many of the verified reviewers on the site bore the same names as facebook employees. “reviewing your employer’s products is definitely against amazon’s rules,” he wrote today. “it’s also not exactly an indicator of confidence in how well they’re selling organically!” neither coordinated nor directed from the company. from an internal post at the launch: “we, unequivocally, do not want facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to amazon.” we will ask them to take down. — boz (@boztank) january 17, 2019 facebook’s ar/vr vp andrew bosworth was quick to respond, tweeting, “[n]either coordinated nor directed from the company. from an internal post at the launch: ‘we, unequivocally, do not want facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to amazon.’ we will ask them to take down.” this is just the latest controversy in the product’s short life. at launch, bosworth felt it necessary to clarify concerns about whether facebook was using the product to listen to calls and collect data. and while apparently not a calculated effort on facebook’s part, it does leave one wondering about internal fallout surrounding the product’s negative response."
"a group of google employees is taking to twitter and instagram tomorrow in an attempt to educate the public about forced arbitration, recode first reported. from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. est, this group will share stories and facts about forced arbitration, as well as interviews from survivors and experts. this comes about one month after this same group of 35 employees banded together to demand google end forced arbitration as it relates to any case of discrimination. the group also called on other tech workers to join them. forced arbitration ensures workplace disputes are settled behind closed doors and without any right to an appeal. these types of agreements effectively prevent employees from suing companies. following the massive, 20,000-person walkout at google in november, google got rid of forced arbitration for sexual harassment and sexual assault claims, offering more transparency around those investigations and more. airbnb, ebay and facebook quickly followed suit. but optional arbitration at google is only granted for full-time employees, which does not include the thousands of contract workers at the company. as the employees noted on medium in december, arbitration is still forced for discrimination cases pertaining to race, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, age and ability. additionally, employee contracts in the u.s. still have an arbitration waiver, the employees wrote. “the change yielded a win in the headlines, but provided no meaningful gains for worker equity … nor any actual change in employee contracts or future offer letters,” the group wrote on medium today. “(as of this publication, we have confirmed google is still sending out offer letters with the old arbitration policy.)” techcrunch has reached out to google and will update this story if we hear back."
"alison johnston didn’t plan to build a startup around death. an early employee at q&a app aardvark that was bought by google, she’d founded tutoring app instaedu and sold it to chegg. she made mass market consumer products. but then, “i had a family member who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and i thought about how she’d be remembered” she recalls. inventing the next big social app suddenly felt less consequential. “i started looking into the funeral industry and discovered that there were very few resources to support and guide families who had recently experienced a death. it was difficult to understand and compare options and prices (which were also much higher than i ever imagined), and there weren’t good tools to share information and memories with others” johnston tells me. bombarded by options and steep costs that average $9,000 per funeral in the us, families in crisis become overwhelmed. ever loved co-founder and ceo alison johnston johnston’s startup ever loved wants to provide peace of mind during the rest-in-peace process. it’s a comparison shopping and review site for funeral homes, cemeteries, caskets, urns, and headstones. it offers price guides and recommends top amazon funeral products and takes a 5 percent affiliate fee that finances ever loved’s free memorial site maker for sharing funeral details plus collecting memories and remembrances. and families can even set up fundraisers to cover their costs or support a charity. the startup took seed funding from social capital and a slew of angel investors about a year ago. now hundreds of thousands of users are visiting ever loved shopping and memorial sites each month. eventually ever loved wants to build its own marketplace of funeral services and products that takes a 10 percent cut of purchases, while also selling commerce software to funeral homes. “people don’t talk about death. it’s taboo in our society and most people don’t plan ahead at all” johnston tells me. rushing to arrange end-of-life logistics is enormously painful, and johnston believes ever loved can eliminate some of that stress. “i wanted to explore areas where fewer people in silicon valley had experience and that weren’t just for young urban professionals.” there’s a big opportunity to modernize this aging industry with a sustainable business model and empathy as an imperative. 86 percent of funeral homes are independent, johnston says, so few have the resources to build tech products. one of the few big companies in the space, the $7 billion market cap public service corporation international, has rolled up funeral homes and cemeteries but has done little to improve pricing transparency or the user experience for families in hardship. rates and reviews often aren’t available, so customers can end up overpaying for underwhelming selection. on the startup side, there’s direct competitors like funeralwise, which is focused on education and forums but lacks robust booking features or a memorial site maker. funeral360 is ever loved’s biggest rival, but ever loved’s memorial sites looked better and it had much deeper step-by-step pricing estimates and information on funeral homes. johnston wants to use revenue from end-of-life commerce to subsidize ever loved’s memorial and fundraiser features so they can stay free or cheap while generating leads and awareness for the marketplace side. but no one has hit scale and truly become wedding site the knot but for funerals. i’ve known johnston since college, and she’s always had impressive foresight for what was about to blow up. from an extremely early gig at box.com to q&a and on-demand answers with aardvark to the explosion of online education with instaedu, she’s managed to get out in front of the megatrends. and tech’s destiny to overhaul unsexy businesses is one of the biggest right now. amazon has made us expect to see prices and reviews up front, so ever loved has gathered rate estimates for about two-thirds of us funeral homes and is pulling in testimonials. you can search for 4-star+ funeral homes nearby and instantly get high-quality results. meanwhile, funeral homes can sign up to claim their page and add information. facebook popularized online event pages. but its heavy-handed prerogatives, generalist tone, and backlash can make it feel like a disrespectful place to host funeral service details. and with people leaving their hometowns, newspapers can’t spread the info properly. ever loved is purpose-built for these serious moments, makes managing invites easy, and also offers a place to collect obituaries, photos, and memories. rather than having to click through a link to a gofundme page that can be a chore, ever loved hosts fundraisers right on its memorial sites to maximize donations. that’s crucial since funerals cost more than most people have saved. ever loved only charges a processing fee and allows visitors to add an additional tip, so it’s no more expensive that popular fundraising sites. next, “the two big things are truly building out booking through our site and expanding into some of the other end of life logistics” johnstone tells me. since the funeral is just the start of the post-death process, ever loved is well positioned to move into estate planning. “there are literally dozens of things you have to do after someone passes away — contacting the social security office, closing out bank accounts and facebook profiles…” johnston reveals that 44 percent of families say they had arguments while divvying up assets — a process that takes an average of 560 hours aka 3 months of full-time work. as the baby boomer era ends over the next 30 years, $30 trillion in assets are expected to transfer through estates, she claims. earning a tiny cut of that by giving mourners tools outlining popular ways to divide estates could alleviate disagreements could make ever loved quite lucrative. “when i first started out, i was pretty awkward about telling people about this. we’re death averse, and that hinders us in a lot of ways” johnston concludes. my own family struggled with this, as an unwillingness to accept mortality kept my grandparents from planning for after they were gone. “but i quickly learned was this was a huge conversation starter rather than a turn off. this is a topic people want to talk about more and educate themselves more on. tech too often merely makes life and work easier for those who already have it good. tech that tempers tragedy is a welcome evolution for silicon valley.”"
"dixa, a copenhagen-based startup that offers a platform to help companies provide better and more consistent customer service across multiple channels, has raised $14 million in series a funding. the round is led by project a ventures, with participation from early investor seed capital. founded in 2015 by jacob vous petersen and mads fosselius, dixa is on mission to end bad customer service with the help of smarter technology to facilitate more personalised customer support. dubbed a “customer friendship” platform, the cloud-based software works across multiple channels — including phone, chat, e-mail and facebook messenger — and employs a smart routing system so the right support requests reach the right people within an organisation. “the problem for customer-facing support teams today is that tickets shared in boxes and legacy call center solutions limit a brand’s ability to connect to their customers where they want to and add extra administrative burdens that ultimately harms the customer experience,” co-founder and ceo mads fosselius tells me. “despite companies and brands promising stellar customer experiences and service, [with] digital transformation and technology vendors promising even more, the facts are that 75 percent of all customers have had a bad customer experience within the past six months and 70 percent say they will leave a brand after just one bad experience,” he says, citing salesforce’s recent ‘state of the connected customer’ 2018 report. dixa’s solution is described by fosselius as a “next-gen” customer engagement platform built for personal and insightful conversations across all channels. to various degrees, it competes with zendesk, freshdesk, salesforce servicecloud and avaya, cisco and 8×8. “dixa is different as it’s a one channel-neutral platform and it works [how[ friends connect and communicate, but for engagement between brands and their customers. we call it a ‘customer friendship’ platform,” says fosselius. this sees dixa help companies ensure that customers can always get the help they need when they need it and on the channel they prefer. the software’s algorithms smartly re-route requests to the correct human or bot based on a raft of data. this includes past conversations, orders, reviews and sentiment. additionally, the context is taken into account, such as the communication channel used, web page visited, device, etc., and the skills plus availability of the relevant customer-facing employee. the result, says dixa, is a system that makes it possible to deliver a consistent level of personal service, regardless of how the customer reaches out. to that end, the dixa platform is targeting “customer-centric” brands with 5-500 customer-facing agents, such as scale-ups and companies in the travel, e-commerce, fintech and transport/delivery sectors. its current customer base spans 23 countries and includes brands like bosch, interflora,trustpilot, danish design icon hay and food waste movement company too good to go. adds fosselius: “we don’t believe in tickets and siloed ‘silver bullet’ customer support solutions doing one thing or one channel very well, the world of customer support is moving towards conversational customer engagement or ‘customer friendship’ as we like to call it, where the strong bond and relation between brands and customers are the center piece.”"
"greetings from chittorgarh, one of my stops on a two-week excursion through goa and rajasthan, india. i’ve been a little too busy exploring, photographing cows and monkeys and eating a lot of delicious food to keep up with *all* the tech news, but i’ve still got the highlights. for starters, if you haven’t heard yet, techcrunch launched extra crunch, a paid premium subscription offering full of amazing content. as part of extra crunch, we’ll be doing deep dives on select businesses, beginning with patreon. read patreon’s founding story here and learn how two college roommates built the world’s leading creator platform. plus, we’ve got insights on patreon’s product, business strategy, competitors and more. sign up for extra crunch membership here. on to other news… y combinator’s latest batch of startups is huge so huge the silicon valley accelerator had to move locations and set up two stages at its upcoming demo days (march 18-19) to accommodate the more than 200 startups ready to pitch investors (who will have to hop between stages at the event). there will also be a virtual demo day live-streamed for some investors to watch “because there are so few seats.” here’s what i’m wondering… at what point is a yc cohort too big? if investors aren’t even able to view all the companies at demo day, what exactly is the point? send me your thoughts. deal of the week another week, another softbank deal. the vision fund’s latest bet is autonomous delivery. the japanese telecom giant has invested $940 million in nuro, the developer of a custom unmanned vehicle designed for last-mile delivery of local goods and services. the startup, also backed by greylock and gaorong capital, will use the cash to expand its delivery service, add new partners, hire employees and scale up its fleet of self-driving bots. and while we’re on the subject of autonomous, tusimple, a self-driving truck startup, has raised a $95 million series d at a unicorn valuation. mamoon hamid and ilya fushman the future of kpcb techcrunch’s connie loizos spoke with mamoon hamid and ilya fushman, who joined kleiner perkins from social capital and index ventures, respectively. the pair talked about kleiner perkins, touching on people who’ve left the firm, how its decision-making process now works, why there are no senior women in its ranks and what they make of softbank’s vision fund. here’s your weekly reminder to send me tips, suggestions and more to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or @kateclarktweets.  facebook almost bought unity facebook ceo mark zuckerberg considered a multi-billion-dollar purchase of unity, a game development platform. this is according to a new book coming out next week, “the history of the future,” by blake harris, which digs deep into the founding story of oculus and the drama surrounding the facebook acquisition, subsequent lawsuits and personal politics of founder palmer luckey. here’s more on the acquisition-that-could-have-been from techcrunch’s lucas matney. venture capital funds indonesia-focused intudo ventures raised a new $50 million fund this week to invest in the world’s fourth most populated country; inreach ventures, the “ai-powered” european vc, closed a new €53 million early-stage vehicle; and btov partners closed an €80 million fund aimed at industrial tech startups. xiaomi-backed electric toothbrush startup soocas raises $30m startup cash jobvite raises $200m+ and acquires three recruitment startups to expand its platform play opendoor files to raise another $200m drivenets emerges from stealth with $110m for its cloud-based alternative to network routers figma gets $40m series c to put design tools in the cloud xiaomi-backed electric toothbrush soocas raises $30 million series c malt raises $28.6 million for its freelancer platform elevate security announces $8m series a to alter employee security behavior massless raises $2m to build an apple pencil for virtual reality subscription scooters just when you thought the scooter boom and the subscription-boom wouldn’t intersect, grover arrived to prove you wrong. the startup is launching an e-scooter monthly subscription service in germany. their big idea is that instead of purchasing an e-scooter outright, grovergo customers can enjoy unlimited e-scooter rides without the upfront costs or commitment of owning an e-scooter. listen to me talk if you enjoy this newsletter, be sure to check out techcrunch’s venture-focused podcast, equity. in this week’s episode, available here, crunchbase news editor-in-chief alex wilhelm and general catalyst’s niko bonatsos chat startups. want more techcrunch newsletters? sign up here."
"less than a year after making a $3 billion investment into the future of virtual reality with the purchase of oculus vr, facebook ceo mark zuckerberg was considering another multi-billion-dollar bet to ensure that his company dominated the vr platform — buying unity, the popular game engine that’s used to build half of all gaming titles. this claim is made in a new book coming out next week, “the history of the future,” by blake harris, which digs deep into the founding story of oculus and the drama surrounding the facebook acquisition, subsequent lawsuits and personal politics of founder palmer luckey. in the early days while he was writing the book, harris worked closely with the facebook pr team and was granted regular interviews with key execs before, as he puts it, his “access came to an end.” harris claims that when researching the book, he gained access to more than 25,000 documents from sources, including a nearly 2,500-word email sent by mark zuckerberg to then-oculus ceo brendan iribe, sheryl sandberg and a half-dozen other facebook leaders detailing his interest in buying unity. techcrunch has not independently verified the contents of the email. the email, dated june 22, 2015, lays out an argument for further prioritizing ar/vr and buying the game engine company. the proposed deal, codenamed “one” according to the book, would have brought one of the world’s most recognizable game developer tool startups into the fold of the internet giant bent on bringing consumers on-board its upcoming vr platform as it looked to ward off competition from other tech giants. unity ceo john riccitiello the potential deal obviously did not end up going through, and since 2015, unity has raised nearly $600 million on a valuation north of $3 billion. a report from cheddar earlier this week noted the company was setting its sights on a 2020 ipo. nevertheless, the email seems to offer rare perspectives into zuckerberg’s thoughts on virtual reality and facebook’s competitive footing. though only parts are referenced in the book, harris has sent techcrunch the full email embedded below: 2015 06 22 mark’s vision by on scribd “we are vulnerable on mobile to google and apple because they make major mobile platforms,” the email reads. “from a timing perspective, we are better off the sooner the next platform becomes ubiquitous and the shorter the time we exist in a primarily mobile world dominated by google and apple. the shorter this time, the less our community is vulnerable to the actions of others. therefore, our goal is not only to win in vr / ar, but also to accelerate its arrival. this is part of my rationale for acquiring companies and increasing investment in them sooner rather than waiting until later to derisk them further.” beyond staking a claim on the vr platform, zuckerberg also frames an argument for owning unity as a means of pushing competitors to support facebook’s other platform services. “if we own unity, then android, windows and ios will all need us to support them on [sic] larger portions of their ecosystems won’t work. while we wouldn’t reject them outright, we will have options for how deeply we support them,” zuckerberg continues. “on the flip side, if someone else buys unity or the leader in any core technology component of this new ecosystem, we risk being taken out of the market completely if that acquirer is hostile and decides not to support us.” though, again, a unity deal never came to fruition, zuckerberg seems to be strongly in favor of the deal going through — though he notes there are clear challenges that could leave their efforts bungled. “going back to the question of whether it is worth investing billions of dollars into unity and other core technology over the next decade, the most difficult aspect to evaluate is that we cannot definitively say that if we do x, we will succeed. there are many major pieces of this ecosystem to assemble and many different ways we could be hobbled. all we know is that this improves our chances to build something great. “given the overall opportunity of strengthening our position in the next major wave of computing, i think it’s a clear call to do everything we can to increase our chances. a few billion dollars is expensive, but we can afford it.” facebook did not comment on the email to techcrunch. a spokesperson, however, did send along a statement about the book: “the book doesn’t get everything right, but what we hope people remember is the future of vr will not be defined by one company, one team, or even one person. this industry was built by a community of pioneers who believed in vr against all odds and that’s the history we celebrate.”"
"if bloomberg and the new york times are to be believed, later this year facebook will introduce a cryptocurrency which will allow whatsapp users to send money instantly. yes, that’s right: facebook . cryptocurrency. earthquake! revolution! the world is tilting on its axis! the end times are cometh! except – um – what exactly are people going to do with facecoin, once they receive it? this is not facebook’s first venture into virtual currencies, payments, or peer-to-peer payments via messenger app. remember facebook credits, its previous virtual currency, launched in 2011 and sunset two years later? remember facebook gifts, launched in 2012 and sunset two years later (there’s a theme here) in part because, to quote the redoubtable josh constine, “facebook never found a way solve distance and localization problems to make gifts work internationally”? and of course facebook messenger payments launched in the us in 2015 and expanded to europe two years later. but facecoin is different; facecoin is on a blockchain. (as a longtime blockchain enthusiast i feel i have earned some right to be a bit sarcastic here.) and facecoin is reportedly a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, a la the sdrs of the imf. so it’s on a blockchain. what does a blockchain give you? well, conceivably, smart contracts, but if it’s a backed stablecoin used for p2p transfer, it’s hard to see how those are relevant. also, conceivably, privacy. right now the crypto world offers stablecoins (dai, paxos, etc.) and privacy coins (zcash, monero, grin) but — weirdly — nobody offers a private stablecoin. if facebook were to do so, that would, in fact, be a genuinely big deal. not least because: on one end, a completely private and encrypted messaging service tied to an open, zerocoin-like, zk-snark backed cryptocurrency and backed by a tech giant would instantly become the go-to mechanism for global money laundering, tax evasion, and just general criming. — alex stamos (@alexstamos) february 28, 2019 conversely, if facecoin isn’t private: on the other, without mathematically-backed privacy features having all of this data in one place would be a massive source of security and privacy risk, and a huge boon for countries with leverage over fb to get data access. wow, gonna be an interesting couple of years. — alex stamos (@alexstamos) february 28, 2019 …although that assumes that it’s actually widely used, an outcome which is, to say the least, far from automatic. again, just because facebook launches a stablecoin cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer payments doesn’t mean people will actually use it. remember facebook credits. remember facebook gifts. the trouble with stablecoins for payments, at least at the moment, is that businesses don’t accept them, so you have to convert them into fiat currency, like dollars or euros or cedis or what-have-you, in order to actually buy things like groceries or rides. true, facebook could offer goods and services for purchase themselves in exchange for facecoin, but then it would basically be facebook credits all over again. but remittances! you cry. yes, very much so. remittances are a massive market, and a holy grail of cryptocurrencies, and whatsapp is widely used worldwide. remittances are the obvious target market here. and it would be huge, and important, and wonderful, if facebook were to make remittances 10x cheaper and faster … but that would require much more than fast international stablecoin transfers, because, again, those stablecoins are not legal tender at their destination, and i don’t know if you’ve noticed but businesses tend to have this whole thing about receiving legal tender. so, yes, it’s great if you can send five thousand facecoin to your family in ghana for an 0.1% fee. but then your family in ghana has to somehow convert them to cedis at an exchange — a task which is, as of this writing, likely to be slower, much clumsier, far more user-hostile, and very possibly even more expensive than the usual medium(s) of remittances. if facebook can bulldoze that obstacle, though — then we’re talking about a big deal. i see two possibilities. one is to establish partnerships with other companies such that they will accept facecoin themselves, so it becomes valuable outside of facebook’s walled garden. but i can’t see this working. again, it’s still not legal tender; it’s infeasible to partner with everybody; and it just adds more complexity for the user — “wait, do i want to pay for this with facecoin or cedis? wait, do they even accept facecoin? hmm, how does my government feel about facecoin and taxes, i wonder?” — , and the global whatsapp audience rightly doesn’t want to deal with this. they just want money they can use. but the other alternative is for facebook to establish relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, or — even more dramatically — become or sponsor exchanges themselves. remember, much of the world already uses mobile money extensively. imagine if facecoin could be seamlessly converted into eg m-pesa or orange money immediately upon receipt. then you could buy a thousand facecoin for us dollars in houston; send it to your brother in ghana, at the speed of the internet (or maybe in a few minutes, depending on how facecoin’s blockchain works); and when he wants to spend it, he just pushes a button on his phone to convert it at the day’s rate into cedis in his mtn mobile money account, courtesy of facebook’s ghanaian exchange partner, in exchange for a tiny percentage of that rate. that would be a huge, huge deal. first, it would offer seamless, immediate, user-friendly international remittances, which itself would be massive (the remittance market is roughly half a trillion dollars a year.) second, it would allow anyone with a phone and the facebook app to maintain a personal account in stablecoins backed by a basket of hard currencies. ask any venezuelan or zimbabwean, or for that matter argentinian, why that would matter. that would also be insanely messy from a legal / regulatory standpoint. there are privacy issues. there are security issues. there are liquidity issues. there are kyc / aml issues. there are regulatory issues involving not just one, or a few, but conceivably hundreds of regulatory domains. but if anyone has the reach and money and wherewithal to push that armada of boulders up this hill, it’s facebook — and the carrot of collecting, say, a few dozen basis points from the $500 billion/year remittances market is more than enough to incentivize them to do so. i could well be wrong. there’s a very good chance that facecoin will just be facebook credits meets facebook gifts, except on the blockchain for no particular reason, in which case it too will presumably fade sheepishly away to be sunsetted two years after it launches. and even if i’m right, i too am deeply uneasy about facebook, who have repeatedly shown themselves to be the opposite of trustworthy, becoming the global gateway for remittance payments worldwide. (although, hey, it could arguably be even worse.) maybe their blockchain will be sufficiently decentralized to be somewhat decouple from their influence, but that seems awfully unlikely (and would be pretty undesirable to regulators). but if i’m right — then this is actually a really big deal, one which could be meaningfully important on a very personal and day-to-day level for many millions of people worldwide. facebook would be, to my mind, at very best a deeply flawed messenger of this change … but they’re still (probably) better them than nobody, and, importantly, if they were to blaze this trail, it would then be much easier for others to follow."
"youtube will demonetize channels that promote anti-vaccination views, after a report by buzzfeed news found ads, including from health companies, running before anti-vax videos. the platform will also place a new information panel that links to the wikipedia entry on “vaccine hesitancy” before anti-vax videos. information panels (part of youtube’s efforts to combat misinformation) about the measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine had already appeared in front of anti-vaccination videos that mentioned it. in a statement to buzzfeed news, a youtube spokesperson said “we have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies. we enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them, we immediately take action and remove ads.” this is the second issue this week that highlights the shortcomings of youtube’s advertising and recommendation algorithms. buzzfeed news’ initial report on feb. 20 came as several major advertisers, including nestle and epic games, said they were pausing ads after youtube creator matt watson revealed how the platform’s recommendation algorithm was being exploited by what he described as a “soft-core pedophilia ring.” buzzfeed news found that the top search results for queries about vaccine safety were usually from legitimate sources, like hospitals, but then youtube’s up next algorithm would often recommend anti-vaccination videos. ads, which are placed by youtube’s advertising algorithm, appeared in front of many of those videos. youtube told buzzfeed news it would implement changes to its up next algorithm to prevent the spread of anti-vax videos. outbreaks of measles throughout the united states and in other countries have prompted scrutiny into the role of social media and tech companies, including facebook and google, in spreading misinformation. advertisers contacted by buzzfeed news who said they will take action to prevent their ads from running in front of anti-vax videos include nomad health, retail me not, grammarly, brilliant earth, cwcbexpo, xtivia, and solarwinds. vitacost told buzzfeed news that it had already pulled ads after the child exploitation issues became known. anto-vax channels now demonetized include vaxxed tv, larrycook333, and ihealthtube."
"rather than be sore about losing independence within facebook, instagram co-founder kevin systrom told me it was an inevitable sign of his app’s triumph. today at south by south west, systrom and fellow co-founder mike krieger sat down for their first onstage talk together since leaving facebook in september. they discussed their superhero origin stories, authenticity on social media, looming regulation for big tech and how they’re exploring what they’ll do next. krieger grew up hitting “view source” on websites while systrom hacked on aol booter programs that would kick people off instant messenger, teaching both how code could impact real people. as instagram grew popular, krieger described the “incredi-bad” feeling of fighting server fires and trying to keep the widely loved app online even if that meant programming in the middle of a sushi restaurant or camping retreat. he once even revived instagram while drunk in the middle of the night, and woke up with no memory of the feat, confused about who’d fixed the problem. the former instagram cto implored founders not to fall into the “recruiting death spiral” where you’re too busy to recruit, which makes you busier, which makes you too busy to recruit… but thankfully, the founders were also willing to dig into some tougher topics than their scrappy startup days. kevin systrom and mike krieger (from left) drive to palo alto to raise their series a, circa january 2011 independence vs. importance “in some ways, there being less autonomy is a function of instagram winning. if instagram had just been this niche photo app for photographers, we probably would be working on that app for 20 years. instead what happened was it got better and better and better, and it improved, and it got to a size where it was meaningfully important to this company,” systrom explained. “if this thing gets to that scale that we want it to get to which is why we’re doing this deal, the autonomy will eventually not be there as much because it’s so important. so in some ways it’s just an unavoidable thing if you’re successful. so you can choose, do you want to be unsuccessful and small and have all the autonomy in the world, or no?” austin, tx – march 11: mike krieger speaks onstage at interactive keynote: instagram founders kevin systrom & mike krieger with josh constine during the 2019 sxsw conference and festivals at austin convention center on march 11, 2019 in austin, texas. (photo by chris saucedo/getty images for sxsw) krieger followed up that “i think if you study . . . all the current companies, the ones that succeed internally eventually have become so important to the acquiring company that it’s almost irresponsible to not be thinking about what are the right models for integration. the advice i generally give is, ‘are you okay with that if you succeed?’ and if you’re not then you shouldn’t do the deal.” if the loss of autonomy can’t be avoided, they suggest selling to a rocket ship that will invest in and care for your baby rather than shift priorities. asked if seeing his net worth ever feels surreal, systrom said  money doesn’t make you happy and “i don’t really wake up in the morning and look at my bank account.” i noted that’s the convenient privilege of having a big one. the pair threw cold water on the idea that being forced to earn more money drove them out of the company. “i remember having this series of conversations with mark and other folks at facebook and they’re like ‘you guys just joined, do not worry about monetization, we’ll figure this out down the road.’ and it actually came a lot more from us saying ‘1. it’s important for us to be contributing to the overall fb inc . . . and 2. each person who joins before you have ads is a person you’re going to have to introduce ads to.’ ” systrom added that “to be clear, we were the ones pushing monetization, not the other way around, because we believed instagram has to make money somehow. it costs a lot to run . . . we pushed hard on it so that we would be a successful unit within facebook and i think we got to that point, which is really good.” but from 2015 to 2016, instagram’s remaining independence fueled a reinvention of its app with non-square photos, the shift to the algorithm and the launch of stories. on having to challenge the fundamental assumptions of a business, “you’ve got maybe a couple years of relevance when you build a product. if you don’t reinvent it every quarter or every year, then you fall out of relevance and you go away.” that last launch was inspired by wanting to offer prismatic identity where people could share non-highlights that wouldn’t haunt them. but also, systrom admits that “honestly a big reason why was that for a long time, people’s profiles were filled with snapchat links and it was clear that people were trying to bridge the two products. so by bringing the two products [feed and stories] into one place, we gave consumers what they wanted.” though when i asked anyone in the crowd who was still mad about the algorithm to hiss, sxsw turned into a snake pit. regulating big tech with systrom and krieger gone, facebook is moving forward with plans to more tightly integrate instagram with facebook and whatsapp. that includes unifying their messaging system, which some say is designed to make facebook’s apps harder to break up with anti-trust regulation. what does systrom think of the integration? “the more people that are available to talk with, the more useful the platform becomes. and i buy that thesis . . . whether or not they will in fact want to talk to people on different platforms, i can’t tell the future, so i don’t know,” systrom said. austin, tx – march 11: josh constine, mike krieger and kevin systrom speak onstage at interactive keynote: instagram founders kevin systrom & mike krieger with josh constine during the 2019 sxsw conference and festivals at austin convention center on march 11, 2019 in austin, texas. (photo by chris saucedo/getty images for sxsw) krieger recommended facebook try to prove users want that cross-app messaging before embarking on a giant engineering challenge of merging their backends. when i asked if systrom ever had a burning desire to instagram direct message a whatsapp user, he admitted “personally, no.” but in a show of respect and solid media training, he told his former employer “bravo for making a big bet and going for it.” then it was time for the hardest hitting question: their thoughts on presidential candidate senator elizabeth warren’s proposal to regulate big tech and roll back facebook’s acquisition of instagram. “do we get our job back?” systrom joked, trying to diffuse the tension. krieger urged more consideration of downstream externalities, and specificity on what problem a break-up fixes. he wants differentiation between regulating facebook’s acquisitions, amazon white-labeling and selling products and apple’s right to run the only ios app store. acquisition vs. competition “we live in a time where i think the anger against big tech has increased ten-fold — whether that’s because the property prices in your neighborhood have gone up, whether it’s because you don’t like russian meddling in elections — there are a long list of reasons people are angry at tech right now and some of them i think are well-founded,” systrom confirmed. “that doesn’t mean that the answer is to break all the companies up. breaking companies up is a very specific prescription for a very specific problem. if you want to fix economic issues there are ways of doing that. if you want to fix russian meddling there are ways of doing that. breaking up a company doesn’t fix those problems. that doesn’t mean that companies shouldn’t be broken up if they get too big and they’re monopolies and they cause problems, but being big in and of itself is not a crime.” interactive keynote: instagram founders kevin systrom & mike krieger with josh constine during the 2019 sxsw conference and festivals at austin convention center on march 11, 2019 in austin, texas systrom then took a jab at warren’s tech literacy, saying “part of what’s surprised me is that generally the policy is all tech should be broken up, and that feels to me again not nuanced enough and it shows me that the understanding of the problem isn’t there. i think it’s going to take a more nuanced proposal, but my fear is that something like a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone’s current feeling of anti-tech rather than doing what i think politicians should do which is address real problems and give real solutions.” the two founders then gave some pretty spurious logic for why instagram’s acquisition helped consumers. “as someone who ran the company for how many years inside of facebook? six? there was a lot of competition internally even and i think better ideas came out because of it. we grew both companies not just one company. it’s really hard question. what consumer was damaged because it grew to the size that it did? i think that’s a strong argument that in fact the acquisition worked out for consumers.” that ignores the fact that if instagram and facebook were rivals, they’d have to compete on privacy and treating their users well. even if they inspired each other to build more engaging products, that doesn’t address where harm to consumers has been done. krieger suggested that the acquisition actually spurred competition by making instagram a role model. “there was a gold rush of companies being like ‘i’m going to be the instagram of x . . . the instagram of audio, the instagram of video, the instagram of dog photos.’ you saw people start new companies and try to build them out in order to try to achieve what we’ve gotten to.” yet no startup besides snapchat, which had already launched, has actually grown to rival instagram. and seeing instagram hold its own against the facebook empire would have likely inspired many more startups — some of which can’t find funding since investors doubt their odds against a combined facebook and instagram as for what’s next for the college buddies, “we’re giving ourselves the time to get curious about things again,” krieger says. they’re still exploring so there was no big reveal about their follow-up venture. but systrom says they built instagram by finding the mega-trend of cameras on phones and asking what they’d want to use, “and the question is, what’s the next wave?”"
"responding to elizabeth warren’s call to regulate and break up some of the nation’s largest technology companies, the venture capitalists that invest in technology companies are advising the presidential hopeful to move slowly and not break anything. warren’s plan called for regulators to be appointed to oversee the unwinding of several acquisitions that were critical to the development of the core technology that make alphabet’s google and the social media giant facebook so profitable… and zappos. warren also wanted regulation in place that would block companies making over $25 billion that operate as social media or search platforms or marketplaces from owning companies that also sell services on those marketplaces. as a whole, venture capitalists viewing the policy were underwhelmed. “as they say on broadway, ‘you gotta have a gimmick’ and this is clearly warren’s,” says ben narasin, an investor at one of the nation’s largest investment firms,” new enterprise associates, which has $18 billion in assets under management and has invested in consumer companies like jet, an online and mobile retailer that competed with amazon and was sold to walmart for $3.3 billion. “decades ago, at the peak of japanese growth as a technology competitor on the global stage, the u.s. government sought to break up ibm . this is not a new model, and it makes no sense,” says narasin. “we slow down our country, our economy and our ability to innovate when the government becomes excessively aggressive in efforts to break up technology companies, because they see them through a prior-decades lens, when they are operating in a future decade reality. this too shall pass.” balaji sirinivasan, the chief technology officer of coinbase, took to twitter to offer his thoughts on the warren plan. “if big companies like google, facebook and amazon are prevented from acquiring startups, that actually reduces competition,” sirinivasan writes. if big companies like google, facebook, and amazon are prevented from acquiring startups, that actually reduces competition. the reason is that if there is less m&a due to legal uncertainty, there is a reduced incentive for angels & vcs to fund those startups in the first place. — balaji s. srinivasan (@balajis) march 8, 2019 a regulation that purports to reduce the power of a large company frequently ends up increasing it, by erecting barriers to entry for startups. often that barrier is licensing. in this case the barrier would be reduced access to capital. — balaji s. srinivasan (@balajis) march 8, 2019 “there are two separate issues here that are being conflated. one issue is do we need regulation on the full platform companies. and the answer is absolutely,” says venky ganesan, the managing director of menlo ventures. “these platforms have a huge impact on society at large and they have huge influence.” but while the platforms need to be regulated, ganesan says, senator warren’s approach is an exercise in overreach. “that plan is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. it’s overwhelming and it’s not commensurate with the issues,” ganesan says. “i don’t think at the end of the day venture capital is worrying about competition from these big platform companies. [and] as the proposal is composed it would create more obstacles rather than less.” using warren’s own example of the antitrust cases that were brought against companies like at&t and microsoft is a good model for how to proceed, ganesan says. “we want to have the technocrats at the ftc figure out the right way to bring balance.” kara nortman, a partner with the los angeles-based firm upfront ventures, is also concerned about the potential unforeseen consequences of warren’s proposals. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook “the specifics of the policy as presented strike me as having potentially negative consequences for innovation. these companies are funding massive innovation initiatives in our country. they’re creating jobs and taking risks in areas of technology development where we could potentially fall behind other countries and wind up reducing our quality of life,” nortman says. “we’re not seeing that innovation or initiative come from the government — or that support for encouraging immigration and by extension embracing the talented foreign entrepreneurs that could develop new technologies and businesses.” nortman sees the warren announcement as an attempt to start a dialog between government regulators and big technology companies. “my hope is that this is the beginning of a dialogue that is constructive,” nortman says. “and since elizabeth warren is a thoughtful policymaker, this is likely the first salvo toward an engagement with the technology community to work collaboratively on issues that we all want to see solved and that some of us are dedicating our career in venture to help solving.”"
"the next phase of social media is about hanging out together while apart. rather than performing on a live stream or engaging with a video chat, instagram may allow you to chill and watch videos together with a friend. facebook already has watch party for group co-viewing, and in november we broke the news that facebook messenger’s code contains an unreleased “watch videos together” feature. now instagram’s code reveals a “co-watch content” feature hidden inside instagram direct messaging. it’s unclear what users might be able to watch simultaneously, but the feature could give igtv a much-needed boost, or just let you laugh and cringe at instagram feed videos and stories. but either way, co-viewing could make you see more ads, drive more attention to creators that will win instagram their favor or just make you rack up time spent on the app without forcing you to create anything. the instagram co-watch code was discovered by techcrunch’s favorite tipster and reverse-engineering specialist jane manchun wong, who previously spotted the messenger watch together code. her past findings include instagram’s video calling, music soundtracks and time well spent dashboard, months before they were officially released. the code mentions that you can “cowatch content” that comes from a “playlist” similar to the queues of videos facebook watch party admins can tee up. users could also check out “suggested” videos from instagram, which would give it a new way to promote creators or spawn a zeitgeist moment around a video. it’s not certain whether users will be able to appear picture-in-picture while watching so friends can see their reactions, but that would surely be more fun. instagram declined to comment on the findings, which is typical of the company when a feature has been prototyped internally but hasn’t begun externally testing with users. at this stage, products can still get scrapped or take many months or even more than a year to launch. but given facebook’s philosophical intention to demote mindless viewing and promote active conversation around videos, instagram co-watching is a sensible direction. facebook launched watch party to this end back in july, and by november, 12 million had been started from groups and they generated 8x more comments than non-synced or live videos. that proves co-watching can make video feel less isolating. that’s important as startups like houseparty group video chatrooms and squad screenshare messaging try to nip at insta’s heels. it’s also another sign that following the departure of the instagram founders, facebook has been standardizing features across its apps, eroding their distinct identities. mark zuckerberg plans to unify the backend of facebook messenger, whatsapp, and instagram to allow cross-app messaging. but instagram has always been facebook’s content-first app, so while watch party might have been built for facebook groups, instagram could be where it hits its stride. speaking of the instagram founders kevin systrom and mike krieger, this article’s author josh constine will be interviewing them on monday 3/11 at sxsw. come see them at 2 pm in the austin convention center’s ballroom d to hear about their thoughts on the creator economy, why they left facebook and what they’ll do next. check out the rest of techcrunch’s sxsw panels here, and rsvp for our party on sunday."
"direct-to-consumer startups — making products that leverage the internet to bypass third-party marketplaces and retailers to engage with and sell directly to their customers — have been one of the biggest categories of growth in the world of e-commerce, and today one of the startups that helped create and prove the model is announcing a big round of funding to take its business to the next stage. thirdlove, which started with bras and now makes and sells a variety of lingerie and underwear catering to a wide variety of women’s shapes and sizes — in part through technology it initially developed that used a smartphone camera to size and suggest products — has raised $55 million in funding. co-ceo heidi zak, who co-founded the company with husband david spector who the co-ceo (both are ex-google execs), said in an interview that the money will be used to help thirdlove add even more sizes beyond the 78 that are offered today (“a bra for every body” is the expression she uses); as well as grow into three new areas: retail, international markets and category expansion into areas such as swim and athletic wear. not all of these may be coming online in the next year, she added, but the money will go towards building strategies in all three. this round bumps thirdlove’s valuation up to over $750 million, according to a source. that’s a huge boost considering that the startup has only raised around $68 million since being founded in 2013. thirdlove is already generating over $100 million in revenues annually, and some 12 million women to date have used fit finder, an online tool that determines the right size bra for the shopper. as impressive as that valuation sounds, so is the list of backers in this latest cash infusion. it’s being co-led by l. catterton, which is owned in part by the luxury goods conglomerates lvmh and groupe arnault; and investment bank allen & company. but also participating are anne wojcicki, the cofounder and ceo of 23andme; her sister susan wojcicki, the ceo of youtube; broadcaster katie couric; nancy peretsman, md of allen & company; tim armstrong, former ceo of oath and aol (who himself is making a big move now into dtc); jeff keswin; michael zeisser, former us chairman at alibaba; felicis ventures and valor equity. (existing investors include andreessen horowitz, nea, yuri milner and keith rabois.) “i’m a big fan of thirdlove’s mission to build a brand for every woman, regardless of her shape, size, age, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation,” said anne wojcicki in a statement. “thirdlove promotes reality over fantasy and shows the spectacular beauty of all sizes, shapes and colors of women.” “thirdlove is the triple threat,” added tim armstrong in an email to me. “they have great margins, own the entire customer relationship and the full stack of data behind it, and they’re in a low competition category serving the largest customer base of commercial people – women.” (armstrong had been spector’s boss at google.) it’s a fair question to ask how and why a bra company is attracting attention from tech investors, and why techcrunch (or any publication) might write about it as a tech startup. the first answer is the most generic (but possibly the most important, as it’s one that we see infusing our news coverage at tc on a daily basis). every company today is potentially a tech company, and every industry is potentially a tech industry. that is to say, we have well passed the point where just about any business or vertical can be built with a tech approach in mind, to underpin the product itself; or to help deliver that product to the world in a way that is better than what preceded it. thirdlove is doing both of those. on the part of the product itself, the company has leveraged the evolution in modern garment manufacturing, with the growth of smartphone usage and online shopping, as well as developments in ai-based computer vision. to get a bra, a woman takes a 60-second fit finder questionaire, which are in turn used to help formulate the best bra size for her body. “best size”, meanwhile, has taken on a new meaning. in the past, women with non-standard proportions would have needed to buy bras from ad hoc bra makers — time consuming and expensive. thirdlove, however, uses big data analytics to essentially aggregate the long tail, turning a single person’s quest into one from many people, and aggregating images of all the busts to help build the design of the bras, which it executes by tapping into more precise manufacturing techniques. this is how thirdlove manages to both create more individualised and tailored pieces while still achieving the all-important metric of e-commerce, economies of scale. the second way thirdlove uses technology is for what zak describes as “using data for market fit.” it’s a big buyer of facebook ads that target people it thinks could become customers, and it follows through with a more complete customer experience both in terms of recommending items and creating an efficient way to browse and then buy. “we use the data we collect from fit finder” — that is the measuring tool in its app — “to create a better physical product and individual sizes, and then we use the data to create a better digital product experience,” zak said. “we do all this in a way that more traditional retailers don’t.” indeed, that old versus new was highlighted to great impact last year, when thirdlove waged a publicity campaign against the much-bigger victoria’s secret after its cmo made a dig against the company in an interview. later, the ceo made other outmoded remarks that did not go down well with investors and the public, and ultimately he ended up stepping down. thirdlove didn’t exactly cause his departure, but its star definitely rose in the wake of all the controversy. zak said the resulting attention, which happened in november, may have had an effect. “we’re not a gifting destination traditionally, but then we suddenly had a stronger november and december,” she said. with the new funds and new strategy, it will be worth watching how thirdlove develops products down the road. currently the company only has distribution in the us, although it’s already seeing a lot of orders coming from outside the country. the plan will be build more facilities more local to different international markets to seize the opportunity with that interest. similarly, its move into retail should be interesting. so far, the only work that the company has done in brick-and-mortar has been in pop-up shops where the aim was not to sell merchandise but simply to spread the word. zak and spector said they would like to retain some of its individualised experience when and if they explore selling products in physical locations. it’s not clear how that would look, but it could potentially mean thirdlove concessions in shops similar to what you typically see in the cosmetics department, where customers are consulted and sold items direct by people representing individual brands."
"a first batch of monthly progress reports from tech giants and advertising companies on what they’re doing to help fight online disinformation have been published by the european commission. platforms including facebook, google and twitter signed up to a voluntary eu code of practice on the issue last year. the first reports cover measures taken by platforms up to december 31, 2018. the implementation reports are intended to detail progress towards the goal of putting the squeeze on disinformation — such as by proactively identifying and removing fake accounts — but the european commission has today called for tech firms to intensify their efforts, warning that more needs to be done in the run up to the 2019 european parliament elections, which take place in may. the commission announced a multi-pronged action plan on disinformation two months ago, urging greater co-ordination on the issue between eu member states and pushing for efforts to raise awareness and encourage critical thinking among the region’s people. but it also heaped pressure on tech companies, especially, warning it wanted to see rapid action and progress. a month on and it sounds less than impressed with tech giants’ ‘progress’ on the issue. mozilla also signed up to the voluntary code of practice, and all the signatories committed to take broad-brush action to try to combat disinformation. although, as we reported at the time, the code suffered from a failure to nail down terms and requirements — suggesting not only that measuring progress would be tricky but that progress itself might prove an elusive and slippery animal. the first response certainly looks to be a mixed bag. which is perhaps expected given the overarching difficulty of attacking a complex and multi-faceted problem like disinformation quickly. though there’s also little doubt that opaque platforms used to getting their own way with data and content are going to be dragged kicking and screaming towards greater transparency. hence it suits their purpose to be able to produce multi-page chronicles of ‘steps taken’, which allows them to project an aura of action — while continuing to indulge in their preferred foot-drag. the guardian reports especially critical comments made by the commission vis-a-vis facebook’s response, for example — with julian king saying at today’s press conference that the company still hasn’t given independent researchers access to its data. “we need to do something about that,” he added. here’s the commission’s brief rundown of what’s been done by tech firms but with emphasis firmly placed on what’s yet to be done: facebook has taken or is taking measures towards the implementation of all of the commitments but now needs to provide greater clarity on how the social network will deploy its consumer empowerment tools and boost cooperation with fact-checkers and the research community across the whole eu. google has taken steps to implement all its commitments, in particular those designed to improve the scrutiny of ad placements, transparency of political advertisement and providing users with information, tools and support to empower them in their online experience. however some tools are only available in a small number of member states. the commission also calls on the online search engine to support research actions on a wider scale. twitter has prioritised actions against malicious actors, closing fake or suspicious accounts and automated systems/bots. still, more information is needed on how this will restrict persistent purveyors of disinformation from promoting their tweets. mozilla is about to launch an upgraded version of its browser to block cross-site tracking by default but the online browser should be more concrete on how this will limit the information revealed about users’ browsing activities, which could potentially be used for disinformation campaigns. commenting in a statement, mariya gabriel, commissioner for digital economy and society, said: “today’s reports rightly focus on urgent actions, such as taking down fake accounts. it is a good start. now i expect the signatories to intensify their monitoring and reporting and increase their cooperation with fact-checkers and research community. we need to ensure our citizens’ access to quality and objective information allowing them to make informed choices.” strip out the diplomatic fillip and the message boils down to: must do better, fast. all of which explains why facebook got out ahead of the commission’s publication of the reports by putting its fresh-in-post european politician turned head of global comms, nick clegg, on a podium in brussels yesterday — in an attempt to control the pr message about what it’s doing (or rather not doing, as the ec sees it) to boot fake activity into touch. clegg (re)announced more controls around the placement of political ads, and said facebook would set up new human-staffed operations centers — in dublin and singapore — to monitor how localised political news is distributed on its network. although the centers won’t launch until march. so, again, not something facebook has done. the staged press event with clegg making his maiden public speech for his new employer may have backfired a bit because he managed to be incredibly boring. although making a hot button political issue as tedious as possible is probably a key facebook strategy. anything to drain public outrage to make the real policymakers go away. (the commission’s brandished stick remains that if it doesn’t see enough voluntary progress from platforms, via the code, is to say it could move towards regulating to tackle disinformation.) advertising groups are also signed up to the voluntary code. and the world federation of advertisers (wfa), european association of communication agencies and interactive advertising bureau europe have also submitted reports today. in its report, the wfa writes that the issue of disinformation has been incorporated into its global media charter, which it says identifies “key issues within the digital advertising ecosystem”, as its members see it. it adds that the charter makes the following two obligation statements: we [advertisers] understand that advertising can fuel and sustain sites which misuse and infringe upon intellectual property (ip) laws. equally advertising revenue may be used to sustain sites responsible for ‘fake news’ content or ‘disinformation’. advertisers commit to avoiding (and support their partners in the avoidance of) the funding of actors seeking to influence division or seeking to inflict reputational harm on business or society and politics at large through content that appears false and/or misleading. while the code of practice doesn’t contain a great deal of quantifiable substance, some have read its tea-leaves as a sign that signatories are committing to bot detection and identification — by promising to “establish clear marking systems and rules for bots to ensure their activities cannot be confused with human interactions”. but while twitter has previously suggested it’s working on a system for badging bots on its platform (i.e. to help distinguish them from human users) nothing of the kind has yet seen the light of day as an actual twitter feature. (the company is busy experimenting with other kinds of stuff.) so it looks like it also needs to provide more info on that front. we reached out to the tech companies for comment on the commission’s response to their implementation reports. google emailed us the following statement, attributed to lie junius, its director of public policy:  supporting elections in europe and around the world is hugely important to us. we’ll continue to work in partnership with the eu through its code of practice on disinformation, including by publishing regular reports about our work to prevent abuse, as well as with governments, law enforcement, others in our industry and the ngo community to strengthen protections around elections, protect users, and help combat disinformation. a twitter spokesperson also told us: disinformation is a societal problem and therefore requires a societal response. we continue to work closely with the european commission to play our part in tackling it. we’ve formed a global partnership with unesco on media literacy, updated our fake accounts policy, and invested in better tools to proactively detect malicious activity. we’ve also provided users with more granular choices when reporting platform manipulation, including flagging a potentially fake account. at the time of writing facebook had not responded to a request for comment."
"personal homepage startup about.me has been acquired. again! the company, once bought by aol for a reported $35 million, decided a couple years after the deal to go it alone, and spun about.me back out to become an independent company. today, about.me announced it’s being acquired by the oakland-based startup broadly. about.me founder and true ventures partner tony conrad called the deal “definitely a meeting of the minds,” as about.me has been more recently focused on helping people and companies showcase their professional talents and skills, while broadly creates tools that help small businesses stay connected to their customers. today broadly offers web chat, text, email, online review collection and team messaging — all in its own mobile app. however, its biggest draw is its online review platform that makes it easier for happy customers to quickly leave the business a positive review on any review site, including google, facebook, tripadvisor and others. last september, broadly raised $10 million in series b funding, co-led by original investor foundry group and new partner calibrate ventures. the funding was allocated toward further product development and hiring — both things which an about.me acquisition can now help to expedite. the company also last year launched its small business-focused web chat feature in its app, and snagged the no. 107 spot on the 2018 inc. 500 list of fastest-growing private companies in the u.s., which cited its 2017 revenue as $4.7 million. terms of the about.me deal were not disclosed, but it is an all-stock acquisition we understand, and one conrad feels positive about. in addition, the majority of about.me’s team is joining broadly as a result of the acquisition, which will bring broadly’s total team to more than 75. this includes about.me’s ceo mindy lauck, whose background includes time at adobe systems, nbcuniversal and e*trade financial. she becomes broadly’s vice president of product following the deal’s closure. conrad said he wanted to find about.me a new home with a company that was a good fit. “it was important to the about.me leadership team to join forces with a company that had a strong go-to-market strategy and a similar level of passion for serving small business owners, who are an integral part of keeping our economy strong and vibrant,” said conrad. “we found that in broadly and see the very real potential for powerful future growth as a result of this alignment,” he added. at broadly, lauck will be focused on expanding the company’s existing product suite to support the full range of the small business owners’ needs — that will include about.me’s technology. the plan is to offer the about.me pages to broadly’s small business user base going forward. “the about.me product is another frictionless mechanism for helping small businesses promote themselves and start capturing leads, which aligns well with our mission and brand,” said josh melick, ceo and co-founder of broadly, in a statement. “more personally, we’re thrilled to welcome the about.me team to the broadly family – we’re even stronger together,” he added."
"a year ago, facebook-owned whatsapp officially introduced its standalone app aimed at small business customers. today, the whatsapp business app has grown to reach 5 million business customers, the company says. and now it’s making the app easier to use on the desktop and the web by porting over several of the most popular features that were previously available only on mobile. these include tools to organize and filter chats, as well as to quickly reply to customer inquiries. quick replies, as the latter feature is called, lets businesses respond to common questions from customers with pre-written replies. it’s similar to a feature facebook introduced several years ago, then called “saved replies,” that allowed business owners with facebook pages to respond to customers with canned messages. on whatsapp business, you can trigger the quick replies by pressing the “/” button on your keyboard. the feature joins several other customer service features, like automated greeting messages that are triggered when the customer pings the business account, or “away” messages that can be scheduled for those times when you’re not able to immediately answer new inquiries. the other two features now rolling out to web and desktop users are labels and chat list filters. the former lets you organize contacts using labels, and the latter lets you filter chat lists by categories, like unread messages, groups or broadcast lists. like quick replies, these were previously available on mobile. the idea, the company explains, is to make it easier on business owners who are working from their computer — sending invoices, scheduling appointments and responding to customer inquiries. they shouldn’t have to turn to their phone to use these sorts of basic customer service features. the new web and desktop features are rolling out today, says whatsapp."

"the german federal cartel office’s decision to order facebook to change how it processes users’ personal data this week is a sign the antitrust tide could at last be turning against platform power. one european commission source we spoke to, who was commenting in a personal capacity, described it as “clearly pioneering” and “a big deal”, even without facebook being fined a dime. the fco’s decision instead bans the social network from linking user data across different platforms it owns, unless it gains people’s consent (nor can it make use of its services contingent on such consent). facebook is also prohibited from gathering and linking data on users from third party websites, such as via its tracking pixels and social plugins. the order is not yet in force, and facebook is appealing, but should it come into force the social network faces being de facto shrunk by having its platforms siloed at the data level. to comply with the order facebook would have to ask users to freely consent to being data-mined — which the company does not do at present. yes, facebook could still manipulate the outcome it wants from users but doing so would open it to further challenge under eu data protection law, as its current approach to consent is already being challenged. the eu’s updated privacy framework, gdpr, requires consent to be specific, informed and freely given. that standard supports challenges to facebook’s (still fixed) entry ‘price’ to its social services. to play you still have to agree to hand over your personal data so it can sell your attention to advertisers. but legal experts contend that’s neither privacy by design nor default. the only ‘alternative’ facebook offers is to tell users they can delete their account. not that doing so would stop the company from tracking you around the rest of the mainstream web anyway. facebook’s tracking infrastructure is also embedded across the wider internet so it profiles non-users too. eu data protection regulators are still investigating a very large number of consent-related gdpr complaints. but the german fco, which said it liaised with privacy authorities during its investigation of facebook’s data-gathering, has dubbed this type of behavior “exploitative abuse”, having also deemed the social service to hold a monopoly position in the german market. so there are now two lines of legal attack — antitrust and privacy law — threatening facebook (and indeed other adtech companies’) surveillance-based business model across europe. a year ago the german antitrust authority also announced a probe of the online advertising sector, responding to concerns about a lack of transparency in the market. its work here is by no means done. data limits the lack of a big flashy fine attached to the german fco’s order against facebook makes this week’s story less of a major headline than recent european commission antitrust fines handed to google — such as the record-breaking $5bn penalty issued last summer for anticompetitive behaviour linked to the android mobile platform. but the decision is arguably just as, if not more, significant, because of the structural remedies being ordered upon facebook. these remedies have been likened to an internal break-up of the company — with enforced internal separation of its multiple platform products at the data level. this of course runs counter to (ad) platform giants’ preferred trajectory, which has long been to tear modesty walls down; pool user data from multiple internal (and indeed external sources), in defiance of the notion of informed consent; and mine all that personal (and sensitive) stuff to build identity-linked profiles to train algorithms that predict (and, some contend, manipulate) individual behavior. because if you can predict what a person is going to do you can choose which advert to serve to increase the chance they’ll click. (or as mark zuckerberg puts it: ‘senator, we run ads.’) this means that a regulatory intervention that interferes with an ad tech giant’s ability to pool and process personal data starts to look really interesting. because a facebook that can’t join data dots across its sprawling social empire — or indeed across the mainstream web — wouldn’t be such a massive giant in terms of data insights. and nor, therefore, surveillance oversight. each of its platforms would be forced to be a more discrete (and, well, discreet) kind of business. competing against data-siloed platforms with a common owner — instead of a single interlinked mega-surveillance-network — also starts to sound almost possible. it suggests a playing field that’s reset, if not entirely levelled. (whereas, in the case of android, the european commission did not order any specific remedies — allowing google to come up with ‘fixes’ itself; and so to shape the most self-serving ‘fix’ it can think of.) meanwhile, just look at where facebook is now aiming to get to: a technical unification of the backend of its different social products. such a merger would collapse even more walls and fully enmesh platforms that started life as entirely separate products before were folded into facebook’s empire (also, let’s not forget, via surveillance-informed acquisitions). seized cache of facebook docs raise competition and consent questions facebook’s plan to unify its products on a single backend platform looks very much like an attempt to throw up technical barriers to antitrust hammers. it’s at least harder to imagine breaking up a company if its multiple, separate products are merged onto one unified backend which functions to cross and combine data streams. set against facebook’s sudden desire to technically unify its full-flush of dominant social networks (facebook messenger; instagram; whatsapp) is a rising drum-beat of calls for competition-based scrutiny of tech giants. this has been building for years, as the market power — and even democracy-denting potential — of surveillance capitalism’s data giants has telescoped into view. calls to break up tech giants no longer carry a suggestive punch. regulators are routinely asked whether it’s time. as the european commission’s competition chief, margrethe vestager, was when she handed down google’s latest massive antitrust fine last summer. her response then was that she wasn’t sure breaking google up is the right answer — preferring to try remedies that might allow competitors to have a go, while also emphasizing the importance of legislating to ensure “transparency and fairness in the business to platform relationship”. but it’s interesting that the idea of breaking up tech giants now plays so well as political theatre, suggesting that wildly successful consumer technology companies — which have long dined out on shiny convenience-based marketing claims, made ever so saccharine sweet via the lure of ‘free’ services — have lost a big chunk of their populist pull, dogged as they have been by so many scandals. from terrorist content and hate speech, to election interference, child exploitation, bullying, abuse. there’s also the matter of how they arrange their tax affairs. the public perception of tech giants has matured as the ‘costs’ of their ‘free’ services have scaled into view. the upstarts have also become the establishment. people see not a new generation of ‘cuddly capitalists’ but another bunch of multinationals; highly polished but remote money-making machines that take rather more than they give back to the societies they feed off. google’s trick of naming each android iteration after a different sweet treat makes for an interesting parallel to the (also now shifting) public perceptions around sugar, following closer attention to health concerns. what does its sickly sweetness mask? and after the sugar tax, we now have politicians calling for a social media levy. just this week the deputy leader of the main opposition party in the uk called for setting up a standalone internet regulatory with the power to break up tech monopolies. talking about breaking up well-oiled, wealth-concentration machines is being seen as a populist vote winner. and companies that political leaders used to flatter and seek out for pr opportunities find themselves treated as political punchbags; called to attend awkward grilling by hard-grafting committees, or taken to vicious task verbally at the highest profile public podia. (though some non-democratic heads of state are still keen to press tech giant flesh.) in europe, facebook’s repeat snubs of the uk parliament’s requests last year for zuckerberg to face policymakers’ questions certainly did not go unnoticed. zuckerberg’s empty chair at the dcms committee has become both a symbol of the company’s failure to accept wider societal responsibility for its products, and an indication of market failure; the ceo so powerful he doesn’t feel answerable to anyone; neither his most vulnerable users nor their elected representatives. hence uk politicians on both sides of the aisle making political capital by talking about cutting tech giants down to size. the political fallout from the cambridge analytica scandal looks far from done. quite how a uk regulator could successfully swing a regulatory hammer to break up a global internet giant such as facebook which is headquartered in the u.s. is another matter. but policymakers have already crossed the rubicon of public opinion and are relishing talking up having a go. that represents a sea-change vs the neoliberal consensus that allowed competition regulators to sit on their hands for more than a decade as technology upstarts quietly hoovered up people’s data and bagged rivals, and basically went about transforming themselves from highly scalable startups into market-distorting giants with internet-scale data-nets to snag users and buy or block competing ideas. zuckerberg owns or clones most of the “8 social apps” he cites as competition the political spirit looks willing to go there, and now the mechanism for breaking platforms’ distorting hold on markets may also be shaping up. the traditional antitrust remedy of breaking a company along its business lines still looks unwieldy when faced with the blistering pace of digital technology. the problem is delivering such a fix fast enough that the business hasn’t already reconfigured to route around the reset.  commission antitrust decisions on the tech beat have stepped up impressively in pace on vestager’s watch. yet it still feels like watching paper pushers wading through treacle to try and catch a sprinter. (and europe hasn’t gone so far as trying to impose a platform break up.)  but the german fco decision against facebook hints at an alternative way forward for regulating the dominance of digital monopolies: structural remedies that focus on controlling access to data which can be relatively swiftly configured and applied. vestager, whose term as ec competition chief may be coming to its end this year (even if other commission roles remain in potential and tantalizing contention), has championed this idea herself. in an interview on bbc radio 4’s today program in december she poured cold water on the stock question about breaking tech giants up — saying instead the commission could look at how larger firms got access to data and resources as a means of limiting their power. which is exactly what the german fco has done in its order to facebook.  at the same time, europe’s updated data protection framework has gained the most attention for the size of the financial penalties that can be issued for major compliance breaches. but the regulation also gives data watchdogs the power to limit or ban processing. and that power could similarly be used to reshape a rights-eroding business model or snuff out such business entirely. #gdpr allows imposing a permanent ban on data processing. this is the nuclear option. much more severe than any fine you can imagine, in most cases. https://t.co/x772nvu51s — lukasz olejnik (@lukolejnik) january 28, 2019 the merging of privacy and antitrust concerns is really just a reflection of the complexity of the challenge regulators now face trying to rein in digital monopolies. but they’re tooling up to meet that challenge. speaking in an interview with techcrunch last fall, europe’s data protection supervisor, giovanni buttarelli, told us the bloc’s privacy regulators are moving towards more joint working with antitrust agencies to respond to platform power. “europe would like to speak with one voice, not only within data protection but by approaching this issue of digital dividend, monopolies in a better way — not per sectors,” he said. “but first joint enforcement and better co-operation is key.” the german fco’s decision represents tangible evidence of the kind of regulatory co-operation that could — finally — crack down on tech giants. blogging in support of the decision this week, buttarelli asserted: “it is not necessary for competition authorities to enforce other areas of law; rather they need simply to identity where the most powerful undertakings are setting a bad example and damaging the interests of consumers.  data protection authorities are able to assist in this assessment.” he also had a prediction of his own for surveillance technologists, warning: “this case is the tip of the iceberg — all companies in the digital information ecosystem that rely on tracking, profiling and targeting should be on notice.” so perhaps, at long last, the regulators have figured out how to move fast and break things."
"messaging platform telegram claims to have had a surge in signups during a period of downtime for facebook’s rival messaging services. in a message sent to his telegram channel, founder pavel durov wrote: “i see 3 million new users signed up for telegram within the last 24 hours.” it’s probably not a coincidence that facebook and its related family of apps went down for most of wednesday, as we reported earlier. at the time of writing, instagram’s service has been officially confirmed restored. unofficially, facebook also appears to be back online, at least here in europe. durov doesn’t offer an explicit explanation for telegram’s sudden spike in signups, but he does take a thinly veiled swipe at social networking giant facebook — whose founder recently claimed he now plans to pivot the ad platform to “privacy.” “good,” adds durov on his channel, welcoming telegram’s 3m newbies. “we have true privacy and unlimited space for everyone.” a contact at telegram confirmed to techcrunch that the facebook apps’ downtime is the likely cause of its latest signup spike, telling us: “these outages always drive new users.” though they also credited growth to “the mainstream overall increasing understanding about facebook’s abusive attention harvesting practices.” a year ago telegram announced passing 200 million monthly active users. though the platform has faced restrictions and/or blocks in some markets (principally russia and iran, as well as china) — apparently for refusing government requests for encryption keys and/or user information. in durov’s home country of russia the government is also now moving to tighten internet restrictions via new legislation — and thousands of people took to the streets in moscow and other russian cities this weekend to protest growing internet censorship, per reuters. such restrictions could increase demand for telegram’s encrypted messaging service in the country as the app does appear to still be partially accessible there. durov, who famously left russia in 2014 — stepping away from his home country and an earlier social network he founded (vk.com) because of his stance on free speech — has sought to thwart the russian government’s telegram blocks via legal and technical measures. the telegram messaging platform has of course also had its own issues with less political downtime too. in a tweet last fall the company confirmed a server cluster had gone down, potentially affecting users in the middle east, africa and europe, although in that case the downtime only lasted a few hours."
"viber, the messaging app owned by japanese e-commerce firm rakuten, is poised to implement a controversial new strategy that will see it charge companies that run chatbots on its platform. the conventional wisdom is to work with content companies to help bring users to messaging platforms and keep them engaged, but viber, which has struggled to keep up with rivals like whatsapp and line, is turning that on its head. starting april 1, viber will charge chatbot operators $4,500 per month for the ability to send up to 500,000 messages to users. those that exceed that range will be eligible to send up to one million messages per month for $6,500. the new fees are being communicated to companies that operate viber chatbots, but viber hinted at its new monetization plans in an email to techcrunch. “bots can be published for free; however, to ensure the highest discoverability and quality of content for bots, we will be introducing a commercial commitment in the coming months. a key aim with this move is to ensure that users are presented with a steady stream of highly relevant and relatable content and a commercial commitment is one key tool for ensuring a quality experience for users,” debbi dougherty, head of b2b marketing & communications for viber, explained. this is a risky strategy that is likely to alienate companies that operate chatbots on viber, as well as brands that bought into a bot strategy. these costs have come out of the blue, much to the surprise of startups that spent time developing chatbots for the viber platform. “for an early-stage startup, this isn’t going to work,” edmundas balčikonis, co-founder of eddy travels — a travel assistant service that’s currently part of the techstars toronto program — told techcrunch by phone. balčikonis said his startup was attracted to the viber platform because it provided all the necessary documentation and apis to build a chatbot upfront and in public. having spent eight months developing its viber bot, eddy travels plans to double down on its efforts with facebook messenger and telegram, where its bot-based service runs without charge and has seen multiples more users and engagement. “viber encouraged us to build the bot, but never discussed the price and there’s no price in the website documentation,” he said. “messenger is showing way more traction for us… we didn’t get any significant engagement on viber.” indeed, the strategy seems to be quite the opposite that viber needs to take if it is to gain market share from the chat app leaders. whatsapp — the world’s largest messaging service with more than 1.6 billion monthly active users — doesn’t currently support chatbots, but instead of playing to its strengths, viber is trying to squeeze additional revenue here under the cloak of “a quality user experience.” times are already hard though at viber. techcrunch spoke to six chatbot startups that develop a range of services for customers, including banks, insurance companies and media, but we found that none run any projects on viber. each said their desire to work on the viber platform would diminish further if they were forced to pay for the privilege. the viber service is popular in pockets of the world, including the philippines, myanmar and some eastern european markets. current ceo djamel agaoua, a seasoned advertising executive, promised to work on the revenue and business model when he took the helm in 2017. under his leadership, viber has pushed its communities chat feature for brands and tried to tap into e-commerce, but little is known of how that has progressed. rakuten’s recent 2018 financial report was released this month and it made scant reference to viber, other than to note that the service and rakuten mobile, the company’s mvno offering in japan, had “substantially increased revenue thanks to their full-scale aggressive sales activities.” no raw figures were provided but rakuten’s “internet services” division, which houses viber, and rakuten mobile, saw its annual revenue increase by 15.9 percent to 788.4 billion jpy. that’s around $7.1 billion, and it sounds impressive, but the bulk of that revenue is from rakuten mobile, which has teamed up with traditional operator kddi to take a crack at japan’s mobile market. what we know about viber is that it has increased its content monetization — which included advertising, sponsored stickers and more — and that now accounts for the bulk of its revenue, surpassing income from viber voip calling packages. but, again, there’s no raw revenue data here. rakuten also no longer provides active user information for viber, which it said has registered more than one billion users since its creation in 2011. that’s not an informative statistic. things seem to be so bad that viber doesn’t even provide an active user number to advertisers, according to a pitch deck seen by techcrunch. the data shown includes a selection of actions that viber claims happen per minute, including 1.2 million logins, but there’s no headline monthly active user statistic. barcelona, which counts rakuten as a sponsor, and coke are among the brands that use viber. now the service’s content monetization push has extended into chatbots, but the obvious risk is that companies and brands will simply go elsewhere where, frankly, they already have a larger and more captive audience. rakuten bought viber for $900 million in january 2014, just one month before facebook forked out $19 billion to acquire whatsapp. the viber deal seemed prescient. sure it didn’t have the same scale as whatsapp, but it was comparable — 300 million registered compared to whatsapp’s 450 million active — and teaming with a major internet company would bring a larger budget and opportunities. the sad reality of today, however, is whatsapp has grown into one of the world’s most important social services but viber has floundered. policies that are as short-sighted as

"joel wallenstrom contributor joel wallenstrom is president and chief executive of wickr, a secure communications company. before wickr, joel co-founded isec partners, one of the world's leading information security research teams, later acquired by ncc group, and served as director for strategic alliances at @stake, one of the very first computer security companies in the industry. more posts by this contributor exposure of your sensitive data isn’t a bug, it’s a feature taking the bite out of the non-malware threat the “below the belt selfie” media circus surrounding jeff bezos has made encrypted communications top of mind among nervous executive handlers. their assumption is that a product with serious cryptography like wickr — where i work — or signal could have helped help mr. bezos and amazon avoid this drama. it’s a good assumption, but a troubling conclusion. i worry that moments like these will drag serious cryptography down to the level of the national enquirer. i’m concerned that this media cycle may lead people to view privacy and cryptography as a safety net for billionaires rather than a transformative solution for data minimization and privacy. we live in the chapter of computing when data is mostly unprotected because of corporate indifference. the leaders of our new economy — like the vast majority of society — value convenience and short-term gratification over the security and privacy of consumer, employee and corporate data.   we cannot let this media cycle pass without recognizing that when corporate executives take a laissez-faire approach to digital privacy, their employees and organizations will follow suit. two recent examples illustrate the privacy indifference of our leaders: the most powerful executive in the world is either indifferent to, or unaware that, unencrypted online flirtations would be accessed by nation states and competitors. 2016 presidential campaigns were either indifferent to, or unaware that unencrypted online communications detailing “off-the-record” correspondence with media and payments to adult actor(s) would be accessed by nation states and competitors. if our leaders do not respect and understand online security and privacy, then their organizations will not make data protection a priority. it’s no surprise that we see a constant stream of large corporations and federal agencies breached by nation states and competitors. who then can we look to for leadership? gdpr is an early attempt by regulators to lead. the european union enacted gdpr to ensure individuals own their data and enforce penalties on companies who do not protect personal data. it applies to all data processors, but the eu is clearly focused on sending a message to the large u.s. based data processors — amazon, facebook, google, microsoft, etc. in january, france’s national data protection commission sent a message by fining google $57 million for breaching gdpr rules. it was an unprecedented fine that garnered international attention. however, we must remember that in 2018 google’s revenues were greater than $300 million … per day! gdpr is, at best, an annoying speed-bump in the monetization strategy of large data processors. jeff bezos accuses national enquirer of blackmailing him — and publishes the details himself it is through this lens that senator ron wyden’s (oregon) idealistic call for billions of dollars in corporate fines and jail time for executives who enable privacy breaches can be seen as reasonable. when record financial penalties are inconsequential it is logical to pursue other avenues to protect our data. real change will come when our leaders understand that data privacy and security can increase profitability and reliability. for example, the compliance, governance and oversight council reports that an enterprise will spend as much as $50 million to protect 10 petabytes of data, and that $34.5 million of this is spent on protecting data that should be deleted. serious efficiencies are waiting to be realized and serious cryptography can help.   so, thank you mr. bezos for igniting corporate interest in secure communications. let’s hope this news cycle convinces our corporate leaders and elected officials to embrace data privacy, protection and minimization because it responsible, profitable and efficient. we need leaders and elected officials to set an example and respect their own data and privacy if we have any hope of their organizations to protect ours."
"in the wake of techcrunch’s investigation yesterday, apple blocked facebook’s research vpn app before the social network could voluntarily shut it down. the research app asked users for root network access to all data passing through their phone in exchange for $20 per month. apple tells techcrunch that yesterday evening it revoked the enterprise certificate that allows facebook to distribute the research app without going through the app store. this not only breaks the research app, but all of facebook’s internal-use employee apps for collaboration and logistics too, from workplace chat to the lunch menu. techcrunch had reported that facebook was breaking apple’s policy that the enterprise system is only for distributing internal corporate apps to employees, not paid external testers. that was actually before facebook released a statement last night saying that it had shut down the ios version of the research program without mentioning that it was forced by apple to do so. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them techcrunch’s investigation discovered that facebook has been quietly operated the research program on ios and android since 2016, recently under the name project atlas. it recruited 13 to 35 year olds, 5 percent of which were teenagers, with ads on instagram and snapchat and paid them a monthly fee plus referral bonuses to install facebook’s research app, the included vpn app that routes traffic to facebook, and to ‘trust’ the company with root network access to their phone. that lets facebook pull in a user’s web browsing activity, what apps are on their phone and how they use them, and even decrypt their encrypted traffic. facebook went so far as to ask users to screenshot and submit their amazon order history. facebook uses all this data to track competitors, assess trends, and plan its product roadmap. facebook was forced to remove its similar onavo protect app in august last year after apple changed its policies to prohibit the vpn app’s data collection practices. but facebook never shut down the research app with the same functionality it was running in parallel. in fact, techcrunch commissioned security expert will strafach to dig into the facebook research app, and we found that it featured tons of similar code and references to onavo protect. that means facebook was purposefully disobeying the spirit of apple’s 2018 privacy policy change while also abusing the enterprise certificate program. sources tell us that apple revoking facebook’s enterprise certificate has broken all of the company’s legitimate employee-only apps. those include pre-launch internal-testing versions of facebook and instagram, as well as the employee apps for coordinating office collaboration, commutes, seeing the day’s lunch schedule, and more. that’s causing mayhem at facebook, disrupting their daily work flow and ability to do product development. we predicted yesterday that apple could take this drastic step to punish facebook much harder than just removing its research app. the disruption will translate into a huge loss of productivity for facebook’s 33,000 employees. [update: facebook later confirmed to techcrunch that its internal apps were broken by apple’s punishment wednesday morning and that it’s in talks with apple to try to resolve the issue and get their employee tools running again. around 3pm pacific on thursday, apple restored facebook’s enterprise certificate, thereby reactivating its internal employee apps. the nearly two work day-long disrupt to its workflow might make facebook think twice about messing with apple again.] for reference, facebook’s main ios app still functions normally. also, you can’t get paid for installing onavo protect on android, only for the facebook research app. and facebook isn’t the only one violating apple’s enterprise certificate policy, as techcrunch discovered google’s screenwise meter surveillance app breaks the rules too. this morning, apple informed us it had banned facebook’s research app yesterday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily. apple provided us with this strongly worded statement condemning the social network’s behavior: “we designed our enterprise developer program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with apple. any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” that comes in direct contradiction to facebook’s initial response to our investigation. facebook claimed it was in alignment with apple’s enterprise certificate policy and that the program was no different than a focus group. seven hours later, a facebook spokesperson said it was pulling its research program from ios without mentioning that apple forced it to do so, and issued this statement disputing the characterization of our story: “key facts about this market research program are being ignored. despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the facebook research app. it wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. all of them with signed parental consent forms.” we refute those accusations by facebook. as we wrote yesterday night, facebook did not publicly promote the research vpn itself and used intermediaries that often didn’t disclose facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process. while users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data facebook can collect through the vpn. a small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative. senator mark warner has since called on facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to support legislation requiring individual informed consent for market research initiatives like facebook research. meanwhile, senator richard blumenthal issued a fierce statement that “wiretapping teens is not research, and it should never be permissible.” the situation will surely worsen the relationship between facebook and apple after years of mounting animosity between the tech giants. apple’s tim cook has repeatedly criticized facebook’s data collection practices, and zuckerberg has countered that it offers products for free for everyone rather than making products few can afford like apple. flared tensions could see facebook receive less promotion in the app store, fewer integrations into ios, and more jabs from cook. meanwhile, the world sees facebook as having been caught red-handed threatening user privacy and breaking apple policy. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them google will stop peddling a data collector through apple’s back door senator warner calls on zuckerberg to support market research consent rules"
"blossom capital, the venture capital firm co-founded by ex-index ventures and localglobe vc ophelia brown, is announcing that it has raised an $85 million fund to invest in european tech startups at the series a stage. lps in the new fund, which techcrunch reported early details of 12 months ago, are said to span leading institutional investors, as well as high-profile tech entrepreneurs. the latter includes robinhood co-founder vladimir tenev and zendesk founder mikkel svane. meanwhile, alongside brown, blossom’s other partners are imran ghory, who previously led data-driven deal sourcing at index and was head of data insights at marketinvoice; mike hudack, who until very recently was cto at deliveroo and prior to that a director of product at facebook; and louise samet, a fairly active angel investor who previously worked at klarna as a digital product manager. also noteworthy, eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that the new vc firm appears to have lost a founding partner already: former uber china executive candice lo was previously listed on the blossom capital website as a blossom co-founder and partner, but techcrunch understands has since departed. “it’s been an honour being part of the team at blossom, but i am leaving to spend more time with family,” said lo in a statement issued to techcrunch. “the fund has reached an incredible milestone and i will be cheering the team on as they continue to grow blossom in europe.” in a call with brown late last week, she said that blossom aims to distinguish itself from other series a investors in europe by embracing a more “west coast” approach with what she calls “high conviction” investing. the firm will write larger cheques than many series a investors — in the region of $5 million to $10 million — and plans to do only four-five deals per year, which, again, is quite unusual. the idea is to place fewer but bigger (and potentially riskier) bets and give the limited number of companies blossom backs enough runway to get to a meaningful series b. arguably, it also means the blossom team, which remains small, won’t be spreading too thin the support offered to its portfolio. on that note, blossom has already backed four companies: duffel, fat llama, frontify and sqreen. co-investors have included y combinator, greylock and index ventures — some decent names for a new firm, to say the least. another aspect that brown talked up is blossom’s use of data to source and support deals. both partners ghory and hudack have technical backgrounds — which should make them especially technical-founder-friendly — and i’m told the firm has developed technology that pulls in various data to look for signals of promising companies across europe’s disparate and fragmented ecosystem. the thinking, says brown, is to ensure a small firm like blossom can still source deals in some of europe’s more hidden tech hubs, rather than just the major ecosystems. she declined to go into much detail on exactly what data is being used, obviously careful not to give away any of blossom’s secret source. more broadly, vcs are increasingly pinning more of their success on the use of data, whether that be throwing data scientists and analysts at the problem or building bespoke software. two other european firms thought to be taking a similar approach to blossom are london-based inreach ventures and berlin’s fly vc. “if you look at the big outcomes in europe, around 70 percent of them today came from outside of the major hubs, in countries such as romania, finland and portugal,” writes brown in a blog post. “data allows us to cover the entire continent, not just the major and overfished capitals like london, paris, berlin and stockholm.”"
"on feed-based “broader social networks, where people can accumulate friends or followers until the services feel more public . . . it feels more like a town square than a more intimate space like a living room” facebook ceo mark zuckerberg explained in a blog post today. with messaging, groups, and ephemeral stories as the fastest growing social features, zuckerberg laid out why he’s rethinking facebook as a private living room where people can be comfortable being themselves without fear of hackers, government spying, and embarrassment from old content — all without encryption allowing bad actors to hide their crimes. perhaps this will just be more lip service in a time of pr crisis for facebook. but with the business imperative fueled by social networking’s shift away from permanent feed broadcasting, facebook can espouse the philosophy of privacy while in reality servicing its shareholders and bottom line. it’s this alignment that actually spurs product change. we saw facebook’s agility with last year’s realization that a misinformation- and hate-plagued platform wouldn’t survive long-term so it had to triple its security and moderation staff. and in 2017, recognizing the threat of stories, it implemented them across its apps. now facebook might finally see the dollar signs within privacy. the new york times’ mike isaac recently reported that facebook planned to unify its facebook, whatsapp, and instagram messaging infrastructure to allow cross-app messaging and end-to-end encryption. and zuckerberg discussed this and the value of ephemerality on the recent earnings call. but now zuckerberg has roadmapped a clearer slate of changes and policies to turn facebook into a living room: -facebook will let users opt in to the ability to send or receive messages across facebook, whatsapp, and instagram"
"facebook and google landed in hot water with apple this week after two investigations by techcrunch revealed the misuse of internal-only certificates — leading to their revocation, which led to a day of downtime at the two tech giants. confused about what happened? here’s everything you need to know. how did all this start, and what happened? on monday, we revealed that facebook was misusing an apple-issued enterprise certificate that is only meant for companies to use to distribute internal, employee-only apps without having to go through the apple app store. but the social media giant used that certificate to sign an app that facebook distributed outside the company, violating apple’s rules. the app, known simply as “research,” allowed facebook unparalleled access to all of the data flowing out of a device. this included access to some of the users’ most sensitive network data. facebook paid users — including teenagers — $20 per month to install the app. but it wasn’t clear exactly what kind of data was being vacuumed up, or for what reason. it turns out that the app was a repackaged app that was effectively banned from apple’s app store last year for collecting too much data on users. apple was angry that facebook was misusing its special-issue enterprise certificates to push an app it already banned, and revoked it — rendering the app unable to open. but facebook was using that same certificate to sign its other employee-only apps, effectively knocking them offline until apple re-issued the certificate. then, it turned out google was doing almost exactly the same thing with its screenwise app, and apple’s ban-hammer fell again. what’s the controversy over these enterprise certificates and what can they do? if you want to develop apple apps, you have to abide by its rules — and apple expressly makes companies agree to its terms. a key rule is that apple doesn’t allow app developers to bypass the app store, where every app is vetted to ensure it’s as secure as it can be. it does, however, grant exceptions for enterprise developers, such as to companies that want to build apps that are only used internally by employees. facebook and google in this case signed up to be enterprise developers and agreed to apple’s developer terms. each apple-issued certificate grants companies permission to distribute apps they develop internally — including pre-release versions of the apps they make, for testing purposes. but these certificates aren’t allowed to be used for ordinary consumers, as they have to download apps through the app store. what’s a “root” certificate, and why is its access a big deal? because facebook’s research and google’s screenwise apps were distributed outside of apple’s app store, it required users to manually install the app — known as sideloading. that requires users to go through a convoluted few steps of downloading the app itself, and opening and trusting either facebook or google’s enterprise developer code-signing certificate, which is what allows the app to run. both companies required users after the app installed to agree to an additional configuration step — known as a vpn configuration profile — allowing all of the data flowing out of that user’s phone to funnel down a special tunnel that directs it all to either facebook or google, depending on which app you installed. this is where the facebook and google cases differ. google’s app collected data and sent it off to google for research purposes, but couldn’t access encrypted data — such as the content of any network traffic protected by https, as most apps in the app store and internet websites are. facebook, however, went far further. its users were asked to go through an additional step to trust an additional type of certificate at the “root” level of the phone. trusting this facebook research root certificate authority allowed the social media giant to look at all of the encrypted traffic flowing out of the device — essentially what we call a “man-in-the-middle” attack. that allowed facebook to sift through your messages, your emails and any other bit of data that leaves your phone. only apps that use certificate pinning — which reject any certificate that isn’t its own — were protected, such as imessage, signal and additionally any other end-to-end encrypted solutions. facebook’s research app requires root certificate access, which facebook gather almost any piece of data transmitted by your phone (image: supplied) google’s app might not have been able to look at encrypted traffic, but the company still flouted the rules — and had its separate enterprise developer code-signing certificate revoked anyway. what data did facebook have access to on ios? it’s hard to know for sure, but it definitely had access to more data than google. facebook said its app was to help it “understand how people use their mobile devices.” in reality, at root traffic level, facebook could have accessed any kind of data that left your phone. will strafach, a security expert with whom we spoke for our story, said: “if facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.” remember: this isn’t “root” access to your phone, like jailbreaking, but root access to the network traffic. how does this compare to the technical ways other market research programs work? in fairness, these aren’t market research apps unique to facebook or google. several other companies, like nielsen and comscore, run similar programs, but neither ask users to install a vpn or provide root access to the network. in any case, facebook already has a lot of your data — as does google. even if the companies only wanted to look at your data in aggregate with other people, it can still hone in on who you talk to, when, for how long and, in some cases, what about. it might not have been such an explosive scandal had facebook not spent the last year cleaning up after several security and privacy breaches. mark zuckerberg is ‘proud’ of how facebook handled its scandals this year can they capture the data of people the phone owner interacts with? in both cases, yes. in google’s case, any unencrypted data that involves another person’s data could have been collected. in facebook’s case, it goes far further — any data of yours that interacts with another person, such as an email or a message, could have been collected by facebook’s app. how many people did this affect? it’s hard to know for sure. neither google nor facebook have said how many users they have. between them, it’s believed to be in the thousands. as for the employees affected by the app outages, facebook has more than 35,000 employees and google has more than 94,000 employees. why did internal apps at facebook and google break after apple revoked the certificates? you might own your apple device, but apple still gets to control what goes on it. apple can’t control facebook’s root certificates, but it can control the enterprise certificates it issues. after facebook was caught out, apple said: “any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” that meant any app that relied on facebook’s enterprise certificate — including inside the company — would fail to load. that’s not just pre-release builds of facebook, instagram and whatsapp that staff were working on, but reportedly the company’s travel and collaboration apps were down. in google’s case, even its catering and lunch menu apps were down. facebook’s internal apps were down for about a day, while google’s internal apps were down for a few hours. none of facebook or google’s consumer services were affected, however. how are people viewing apple in all this? nobody seems thrilled with facebook or google at the moment, but not many are happy with apple, either. even though apple sells hardware and doesn’t use your data to profile you or serve you ads — like facebook and google do — some are uncomfortable with how much power apple has over the customers — and enterprises — that use its devices. in revoking facebook and google’s enterprise certificates and causing downtime, it has a knock-on effect internally. is this legal in the u.s.? what about in europe with gdpr? well, it’s not illegal — at least in the u.s. facebook says it gained consent from its users. the company even said its teenage users must obtain parental consent, even though it was easily skippable and no verification checks were made. it wasn’t even explicitly clear that the children who “consented” really understood how much privacy they were really handing over. facebook’s vpn app puts spotlight on kids’ consent that could lead to major regulatory headaches down the line. “if it turns out that european teens have been participating in the research effort facebook could face another barrage of complaints under the bloc’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) — and the prospect of substantial fines if any local agencies determine it failed to live up to consent and ‘privacy by design’ requirements baked into the bloc’s privacy regime,” wrote techcrunch’s natasha lomas. who else has been misusing certificates? don’t think that facebook and google are alone in this. it turns out that a lot of companies might be flouting the rules, too. according to many finding companies on social media, sonos uses enterprise certificates for its beta program, as does finance app binance, as well as doordash for its fleet of contractors. it’s not known if apple will also revoke their enterprise certificates. what next? it’s anybody’s guess, but don’t expect this situation to die down any time soon. facebook may face repercussions with europe, as well as at home. two u.s. senators, mark warner and richard blumenthal, have already called for action, accusing facebook of “wiretapping teens.” the federal trade commission may also investigate, if blumenthal gets his way. senator warner calls on zuckerberg to support market research consent rules"
"desperate for data on its competitors, facebook has been secretly paying people to install a “facebook research” vpn that lets the company suck in all of a user’s phone and web activity, similar to facebook’s onavo protect app that apple banned in june and that was removed in august. facebook sidesteps the app store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a techcrunch investigation confirms. facebook admitted to techcrunch it was running the research program to gather data on usage habits. since 2016, facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the ios or android “facebook research” app. facebook even asked users to screenshot their amazon order history page. the program is administered through beta testing services applause, betabound and utest to cloak facebook’s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as “project atlas” — a fitting name for facebook’s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe. seven hours after this story was published, facebook told techcrunch it would shut down the ios version of its research app in the wake of our report. but on wednesday morning, an apple spokesperson confirmed that facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked facebook’s research app on tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so). you can read our full report on the development here. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data an apple spokesperson provided this statement. “we designed our enterprise developer program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with apple. any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” facebook’s research program will continue to run on android. [update 2/21/19: facebook will pull onavo from the google play store and eventually shut it down. it will also cease to recruit users for the android version of its research app, though it plans other paid research initiatives. facebook’s research app requires users to ‘trust’ it with extensive access to their datawe asked guardian mobile firewall’s security expert will strafach to dig into the facebook research app, and he told us that “if facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.” it’s unclear exactly what data facebook is concerned with, but it gets nearly limitless access to a user’s device once they install the app. the strategy shows how far facebook is willing to go and how much it’s willing to pay to protect its dominance — even at the risk of breaking the rules of apple’s ios platform on which it depends. apple may have asked facebook to discontinue distributing its research app. a more stringent punishment would be to revoke facebook’s permission to offer employee-only apps. the situation could further chill relations between the tech giants. apple’s tim cook has repeatedly criticized facebook’s data collection practices. facebook disobeying ios policies to slurp up more information could become a new talking point. facebook’s research program is referred to as project atlas on sign-up sites that don’t mention facebook’s involvement “the fairly technical sounding ‘install our root certificate’ step is appalling,” strafach tells us. “this hands facebook continuous access to the most sensitive data about you, and most users are going to be unable to reasonably consent to this regardless of any agreement they sign, because there is no good way to articulate just how much power is handed to facebook when you do this.” facebook’s surveillance app facebook first got into the data-sniffing business when it acquired onavo for around $120 million in 2014. the vpn app helped users track and minimize their mobile data plan usage, but also gave facebook deep analytics about what other apps they were using. internal documents acquired by charlie warzel and ryan mac of buzzfeed news reveal that facebook was able to leverage onavo to learn that whatsapp was sending more than twice as many messages per day as facebook messenger. onavo allowed facebook to spot whatsapp’s meteoric rise and justify paying $19 billion to buy the chat startup in 2014. whatsapp has since tripled its user base, demonstrating the power of onavo’s foresight. over the years since, onavo clued facebook in to what apps to copy, features to build and flops to avoid. by 2018, facebook was promoting the onavo app in a protect bookmark of the main facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. facebook also launched the onavo bolt app that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism. onavo’s main app remains available on google play and has been installed more than 10 million times. the backlash heated up after security expert strafach detailed in march how onavo protect was reporting to facebook when a user’s screen was on or off, and its wi-fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the vpn was turned off. in june, apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that’s not necessary for an app to function. apple proceeded to inform facebook in august that onavo protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the app store, which it did, deepa seetharaman of the wsj reported. but that didn’t stop facebook’s data collection. project atlas techcrunch recently received a tip that despite onavo protect being banished by apple, facebook was paying users to sideload a similar vpn app under the facebook research moniker from outside of the app store. we investigated, and learned facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the facebook research app: betabound, utest and applause. facebook began distributing the research vpn app in 2016. it has been referred to as project atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to onavo protect magnified and apple instituted its new rules that prohibited onavo. previously, a similar program was called project kodiak. facebook didn’t want to stop collecting data on people’s phone usage and so the research program continued, in disregard for apple banning onavo protect. facebook’s research app on ios ads (shown below) for the program run by utest on instagram and snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a “paid social media research study.” the sign-up page for the facebook research program administered by applause doesn’t mention facebook, but seeks users “age: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).” if minors try to sign-up, they’re asked to get their parents’ permission with a form that reveal’s facebook’s involvement and says “there are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child’s use of apps. you will be compensated by applause for your child’s participation.” for kids short on cash, the payments could coerce them to sell their privacy to facebook. the applause site explains what data could be collected by the facebook research app (emphasis mine): “by installing the software, you’re giving our client permission to collect data from your phone that will help them understand how you browse the internet, and how you use the features in the apps you’ve installed . . . this means you’re letting our client collect information such as which apps are on your phone, how and when you use them, data about your activities and content within those apps, as well as how other people interact with you or your content within those apps. you are also letting our client collect information about your internet browsing activity (including the websites you visit and data that is exchanged between your device and those websites) and your use of other online services. there are some instances when our client will collect this information even where the app uses encryption, or from within secure browser sessions.” meanwhile, the betabound sign-up page with a url ending in “atlas” explains that “for $20 per month (via e-gift cards), you will install an app on your phone and let it run in the background.” it also offers $20 per friend you refer. that site also doesn’t initially mention facebook, but the instruction manual for installing facebook research reveals the company’s involvement. facebook’s intermediary utest ran ads on snapchat and instagram, luring teens to the research program with the promise of money   facebook seems to have purposefully avoided testflight, apple’s official beta testing system, which requires apps to be reviewed by apple and is limited to 10,000 participants. instead, the instruction manual reveals that users download the app from r.facebook-program.com and are told to install an enterprise developer certificate and vpn and “trust” facebook with root access to the data their phone transmits. apple requires that developers agree to only use this certificate system for distributing internal corporate apps to their own employees. randomly recruiting testers and paying them a monthly fee appears to violate the spirit of that rule. security expert will strafach found facebook’s research app contains lots of code from onavo protect, the facebook-owned app apple banned last year once installed, users just had to keep the vpn running and sending data to facebook to get paid. the applause-administered program requested that users screenshot their amazon orders page. this data could potentially help facebook tie browsing habits and usage of other apps with purchase preferences and behavior. that information could be harnessed to pinpoint ad targeting and understand which types of users buy what. techcrunch commissioned strafach to analyze the facebook research app and find out where it was sending data. he confirmed that data is routed to “vpn-sjc1.v.facebook-program.com” that is associated with onavo’s ip address, and that the facebook-program.com domain is registered to facebook, according to markmonitor. the app can update itself without interacting with the app store, and is linked to the email address peoplejourney@fb.com. he also discovered that the enterprise certificate first acquired in 2016 indicates facebook renewed it on june 27th, 2018 — weeks after apple announced its new rules that prohibited the similar onavo protect app. “it is tricky to know what data facebook is actually saving (without access to their servers). the only information that is knowable here is what access facebook is capable of based on the code in the app. and it paints a very worrisome picture,” strafach explains. “they might respond and claim to only actually retain/save very specific limited data, and that could be true, it really boils down to how much you trust facebook’s word on it. the most charitable narrative of this situation would be that facebook did not think too hard about the level of access they were granting to themselves . . . which is a startling level of carelessness in itself if that is the case.” [update: techcrunch also found that google’s screenwise meter surveillance app also breaks the enterprise certificate policy, though it does a better job of revealing the company’s involvement and how it works than facebook does.] google will stop peddling a data collector through apple’s back door “flagrant defiance of apple’s rules” in response to techcrunch’s inquiry, a facebook spokesperson confirmed it’s running the program to learn how people use their phones and other services. the spokesperson told us “like many companies, we invite people to participate in research that helps us identify things we can be doing better. since this research is aimed at helping facebook understand how people use their mobile devices, we’ve provided extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate. we don’t share this information with others and people can stop participating at any time.” facebook’s research app requires root certificate access, which facebook gather almost any piece of data transmitted by your phone facebook’s spokesperson claimed that the facebook research app was in line with apple’s enterprise certificate program, but didn’t explain how in the face of evidence to the contrary. they said facebook first launched its research app program in 2016. they tried to liken the program to a focus group and said nielsen and comscore run similar programs, yet neither of those ask people to install a vpn or provide root access to the network. the spokesperson confirmed the facebook research program does recruit teens but also other age groups from around the world. they claimed that onavo and facebook research are separate programs, but admitted the same team supports both as an explanation for why their code was so similar. facebook’s research program requested users screenshot their amazon order history to provide it with purchase data however, facebook’s claim that it doesn’t violate apple’s enterprise certificate policy is directly contradicted by the terms of that policy. those include that developers “distribute provisioning profiles only to your employees and only in conjunction with your internal use applications for the purpose of developing and testing”. the policy also states that “you may not use, distribute or otherwise make your internal use applications available to your customers” unless under direct supervision of employees or on company premises. given facebook’s customers are using the enterprise certificate-powered app without supervision, it appears facebook is in violation. seven hours after this report was first published, facebook updated its position and told techcrunch that it would shut down the ios research app. facebook noted that the research app was started in 2016 and was therefore not a replacement for onavo protect. however, they do share similar code and could be seen as twins running in parallel. a facebook spokesperson also provided this additional statement: “key facts about this market research program are being ignored. despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the facebook research app. it wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. all of them with signed parental consent forms.” facebook did not publicly promote the research vpn itself and used intermediaries that often didn’t disclose facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process. while users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data facebook can collect through the vpn. a small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative. facebook disobeying apple so directly and then pulling the app could hurt their relationship. “the code in this ios app strongly indicates that it is simply a poorly re-branded build of the banned onavo app, now using an enterprise certificate owned by facebook in direct violation of apple’s rules, allowing facebook to distribute this app without apple review to as many users as they want,” strafach tells us. onv prefixes and mentions of graph.onavo.com, “onavoapp://” and “onavoprotect://” custom url schemes litter the app. “this is an egregious violation on many fronts, and i hope that apple will act expeditiously in revoking the signing certificate to render the app inoperable.” facebook is particularly interested in what teens do on their phones as the demographic has increasingly abandoned the social network in favor of snapchat, youtube and facebook’s acquisition instagram. insights into how popular with teens is chinese video music app tiktok and meme sharing led facebook to launch a clone called lasso and begin developing a meme-browsing feature called lol, techcrunch first reported. but facebook’s desire for data about teens riles critics at a time when the company has been battered in the press. analysts on tomorrow’s facebook earnings call should inquire about what other ways the company has to collect competitive intelligence now that it’s ceased to run the research program on ios. last year when tim cook was asked what he’d do in mark zuckerberg’s position in the wake of the cambridge analytica scandal, he said “i wouldn’t be in this situation . . . the truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. we’ve elected not to do that.” zuckerberg told ezra klein that he felt cook’s comment was “extremely glib.” now it’s clear that even after apple’s warnings and the removal of onavo protect, facebook was still aggressively collecting data on its competitors via apple’s ios platform. “i have never seen such open and flagrant defiance of apple’s rules by an app store developer,” strafach concluded. now that facebook has ceased the program on ios and its android future is uncertain, it may either have to invent new ways to surveil our behavior amidst a climate of privacy scrutiny, or be left in the dark. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data additional reporting by zack whittaker. updated with comment from

"standard cognition helps retail stores stand up to jeff bezos’ juggernaut. the $50 million-funded autonomous checkout startup is racing to equip bigger shops with scanless payment technology that lets customers walk out the door without ever stopping at a cashier. while amazon go opens its own 2,000 square foot boutiques, standard cognition is working on outfitting 20,000 square foot and larger drug stores and grocers. that led standard cognition to make its first acquisition, explorer.ai. why would an automated checkout company acquire a self-driving car startup? because whether you’re tracking shoppers or pedestrians, you need sophisticated maps of the real world. the more accurate the machine vision is, the larger the store you can equip. and since standard cognition uses ceiling-based cameras instead of putting them on every shelf like amazon, it’s much cheaper to keep eyes on a bigger space. standard cognition is only just over a year old, but with the backing of y combinator, alexis ohanian and garry tan’s initialized capital, and a fast-moving team of seven co-founders, it believes it can outmaneuver amazon. that means doing whatever it can to leap forward. standard cognition already had in-house mapping technology, but explorer.ai’s team and tech could accelerate its quest to bring even 100,000 sq ft big box supercenters into the automated checkout age. “it’s the wild west — applying cutting-edge, state-of-the-art machine learning research that’s hot off the press. we read papers then implement it weeks after it’s published, putting the ideas out into the wild and making them production-worthy — taking it from state-of-the-art to dumb machines you can kick and they won’t fall over.” says standard cognition co-founder and ceo jordan fisher. “it’s no easy task and the exactness we’re going to require will only increase. having a world-class team of engineers and researchers that can build the next generation version of our mapping is why we’re so excited to have the team joining us.” from av to ac explorer.ai is was founded in 2017 too, and its acquisition so soon is a testament to how hot the autonomous driving and checkout markets are. akshay goel, nagasrikanth kallakuri, and tushar dadlani noticed self-driving vehicle startups were all trying to generate their own maps. they cobbled together data from several providers, built maps specifically for different purposes, and soon had fellow startups trying to throw money at them. they raised just under $1 million from story ventures, early facebook engineer nick heyman and more, growing the team to seven employees. explorer.ai’s co-founders   but eventually explorer.ai realized the bigger players were too cautious to rely on outside maps and it could be years before they’d be comfortable with the idea. “our view is it would take quite a while to become a commercial success in mapping for autonomous vehicles” goel tells me. “most of the companies we were working with in partnerships tried to acquire us from an early stage. should we fundraise more or start looking at the acquisition process?” the team asked itself as its cash dwindled. explorer.ai got a few terms sheets for funding, but weren’t sure they’d be able to go to market fast enough. the founders shopped the startup around “to pretty much everyone” goel says, though they refused to name names when i asked if that included natural acquirers like uber and google’s waymo. but then they took a left turn into retail. “what we saw was that essentially since autonomous checkout has a lot fewer safety issues, [standard cognition] could go to market much faster, and mapping had a large impact on autonomous checkout.” the two companies declined to disclose financial terms of the deal, but fisher tells me “we can definitely say it was a competitive process and we’re excited that we could win the hearts and minds of the explorer team.” they’ll join standard cognition’s 40-plus employees as the work on pilots for us and japanese retail locations. goel adds that “the investors, founders, and team are happy”, implying the payout more than returned the money it’d raised. explorer.ai made self-driving car maps before joining standard cognition the big question standard cognition’s customers are asking are whether autonomous checkout is cost-effective, simple for customers to understand, and won’t let shoplifters destroy their margins. that means minimizing installation fees, perfecting onboarding and instruction, and recognizing the difference between someone putting an item back on the shelf versus into their jacket. the startup believes that done right, human cashiers can be repurposed as concierges that help customers find what they’re looking for and buy more without having to stand in line. standard cognition co-founder and ceo jordan fisher “how do you make this a bulletproof, reproducible system that works as well as a till in a grocery store that no one worries about breaking?” is the challenge fisher and his new compatriots must solve. “amazon is pursuing what we call as shelf-based approach with sensors every few inches on every shelf. what’s not great is the expense, the complexity of the electrical and compute systems . . . this is why you’re seeing autonomous checkout applied to amazon go and not larger whole foods stores. not from a lack of desire from amazon, but because it’s not technologically tenable with the approach that they’re taking. i’m confident they’ll tackle that challenge in the next few years but today they’re limited by their technology.” and so standard cognition is pushing as fast as it can build a lead and brand by giving independent retail stores and chains the firepower to fight off amazon. standard cognition will also have to outcompete fellow autonomous checkout startups like ex-pandora cto will glaser’s grabango, which announced it’d raised $12 million today. grabango now has signed deals with four u.s. retail chains up to 25,000 sq ft in size and has 37 employees. there’s also fellow y combinator startup inokyo with a pop-up shop in mountain view; and trigo vision that has a deal with an israeli grocery chain for more than 200 stores. “i wasn’t thinking we’d do any acquisitions a month ago” fisher reveals. “our goal is not just to deliver autonomous checkout to the world but to do it phenomenally quickly. we’re at the beginning of a space race. two to three years from now, i think this will be potentially as crowded as autonomous vehicles. we’re in the lead today but that’s not enough for us. we need to be light-years ahead to capture as much of the market as we want. [with the explorer.ai acquisition] how many days does this advance us? how much further along on our roadmap for world domination does this bring us? when we sat down, it was tangible, the real progression of the roadmap.”"
"jake bright contributor jake bright is a writer and author in new york city. he is co-author of the next africa. more posts by this contributor nigerian fintech startup onefi acquires payment company amplify seven africa-focused startups present at y combinator’s demo day kenyan communications hardware company brck has acquired the assets of nairobi based internet provider surf and its u.s. parent everylayer in a purchase deal of an undisclosed amount announced friday. based in nairobi, surf is a hotspot service provider aimed at offering affordable internet to lower income segments. brck is a five year old venture that pairs its rugged wifi routers to internet service packages designed to bring people online in frontier and emerging markets. with the acquisition, brck gains the assets of san francisco based everylayer and its surf subsidiary, including 1200 hotspots and 200,000 active customers across 22 cities in kenya, according to brck ceo and founder erik hersman. everylayer ceo mark summer confirmed these details with techcrunch. backed by $10 million from investors including steve case’s revolution vc fund, brck plans to use its new resources to expand to an undisclosed east african country and is eying options abroad. “we’re looking at indonesia and starting our pilot in mexico next month,” hersman told techcrunch on a call from kigali. brck built its platform around providing internet solutions primarily in kenya and rwanda. in 2017, the company rolled out its supabrck product and paired it to its moja service, which offers free public wifi—internet, music, and entertainment—subsidized by commercial partners. there’s not a requirement to click on or watch advertisements to gain moja access, though users can gain faster access if they “interact with one of our business partners…by doing a survey, downloading an app, or watching an ad,” said hersman. in 2018, brck began offering supabrck devices to drivers of nairobi’s matatu buses for kenyan commuters to access moja. as of january moja traffic is racking up 300,000 active uniques and 3.7 million impressions per month, according to hersman. the brck founder has described africa’s internet challenges—mainly the lowest penetration rates in the world—as shifting toward more of an affordability than availability problem. “the demand on internet in africa is largely driven by the 10 to 15 percent who can afford it. the real massive opportunity is trying to connect the 70 to 80 percent of the people who can’t. that’s where the internet race really is,” hersman told techcrunch in 2017. speaking on the recent everylayer asset acquisition, hersman explained that improvements over recent years in africa’s smartphone penetration, internet costs, and broadband capabilities are not necessarily translating to large portions of africa’s 1.2 billion people. “even with penetration improving, even with data prices going down, there’s still not a viable way to get internet to huge swaths of people,” he told techcrunch. “the real numbers are that about 20 percent in every country can now afford to buy data-bundles, but 80 percent can’t.” with the recent asset acquisition brck hopes to add its experience in delivering internet solutions on transit networks to surf’s wifi and ip capabilities toward new partnerships and service countries. “surf has a model for fixed wifi and a team that roll things out in kenya and new geographies. we can go to big isps in other countries and create partnerships…for fixed wifi followed by transportation connectivity,” said hersman. brck will maintain the surf name in the short term, “but over the next three to six months it will all be rebranded and the platform will become moja wifi,” hersman said. surf’s existing employees have been invited to join brck. as for surf’s parent company, everylayer, “at this point it will be shutdown. one of the founders andris bjornson will join brck,” ceo mark summer told techcrunch. in 2018, everylayer announced a partnership whereby surf would also offer facebook’s express wifi hotspots on its network. with the acquisition, that arrangement will continue “only for those existing express wifi locations” until brck transitions “those…nodes to moja wifi in the next three to six months, explained brck ceo erik hersman. “ on data-privacy for brck’s moja users, “brck doesn’t capture personally identifying information beyond the macid of the device connecting…we don’t associate users’ browsing data with individual users and there are no logins,” hersman told techcrunch."
"in the first days of 2017, osterhout design group arrived at ces with a two-story booth and huge promises. the startup’s founder, ralph osterhout, wanted to take the small san francisco-based company even further past its military contractor roots in ar, building out major enterprise and consumer businesses with flashy new product lines. the company had just raised $58 million, and the las vegas electronics show served as its launchpad for its r-8 and r-9 augmented reality glasses lines that osterhout hoped would bring “glasses to the masses.” less than a year later, however, the company had burned through its funding and couldn’t pay employees. by early 2018, odg had lost half of its workforce as it sought loans to pay back employees. today, a skeleton crew awaits a patent sale less than a week away after acquisitions from several large tech companies, including facebook and magic leap, fell through, multiple sources tell techcrunch. odg founder and ceo ralph osterhout ralph osterhout, 73, founded odg 20 years ago as a high-tech toy company, built after his previous venture, machina, collapsed in what a wired report at the time called “a spectacular bankruptcy.” after underwriting odg with $14,000 of his own cash, osterhout kept the startup plugging along on its own merits before he decided that it was time to reach for outside funding to turn his company into a powerhouse in the burgeoning augmented reality industry. at the end of 2016, the company raised a $58 million round led by 21st century fox. odg was already getting thousands of orders for its r-7 glasses, an enterprise-focused product that it billed as a head-worn android tablet that could help workers go through checklists, review documents and share live video feeds hands-free. osterhout wanted to get ar glasses into the hands of consumers and take advantage of new tech advances, even as magic leap was teasing the release of its own heavily hyped consumer product. “i hope magic leap is a huge success. i want everyone in ar to be a huge success,” osterhout said in an interview with techcrunch in 2017. “[augmented reality] is going to be transformative.” months later, a large chinese firm approached odg with an offer north of the company’s $258 million series a valuation, a source tells techcrunch. talks fell through, but odg’s leadership was at their most ambitious and felt like they couldn’t be stopped. at the same time, following the ces 2017 product unveil, some employees wondered whether having three distinct product lines under development aimed at roughly the same customer was the right direction for the company with around 100 employees. ralph osterhout’s strong internal popularity kept these concerns at bay even as the company faced double-digit return rates from customers of its current-generation r-7 glasses due to manufacturing issues. “that’s a little bit the story of odg and ralph, in general: everything is a prototype, nothing is finished, and before one thing is 60 percent done, you’re already onto the next one,” a former employee tells techcrunch. “i think the heart of odg’s downfall was its lack of focus.” odg unveils its first consumer ar/vr glasses, built on qualcomm’s snapdragon 835 chip the company never ended up shipping the r-9 or the r-8 or even fulfilling all of its r-7 orders. it blew through its funding before the fall of 2017, and it wasn’t long before employees were on half-pay and soon stopped getting paid at all. odg sought backing from chinese firms, but sources say that a negative trade environment hampered those efforts. in 2018, it received an $8 million loan from a chinese firm used to pay back employees as osterhout began trying to scrounge together an exit strategy, seeking buyers for the company that bore his name. suitors for the company included magic leap, facebook, razer and lenovo, sources tell techcrunch. in each case talks fell through, as osterhout was convinced that his company was being undervalued by the prospective acquirers. odg’s san francisco offices in 2016 sources say that magic leap continued to bump up its offer, eventually signing a letter of intent in the final months of 2018 to purchase the startup. the final proposed purchase price ended up at $35 million, still a far cry from its 2016 valuation, a source familiar with the deal tells techcrunch. this offer came with stipulations for the types of engineers magic leap wanted to bring aboard, leading odg to shrink its staff to just a couple dozen employees. as the startup whittled itself down to prepare for a disappointing, yet relatively dignified, sign-off, magic leap began to grow cagey about finalizing the acquisition, sources say. as the deal started to fall through, some in odg’s leadership began to wonder aloud whether magic leap was “acting in poor faith” and was only looking to starve the company before purchasing assets at a discount in a patent sale. “ralph turned around and he didn’t have a company or team anymore, and then magic leap goes, you know what, we’re just going to buy the ip, we don’t want the company, you don’t have a company anymore,” one source said. magic leap did not respond to a request for comment. with the deal shot and the indebted company in shambles, the team dwindled down further to a skeleton crew — essentially a deals team — as company assets were put up for sale by ip advisory firm hilco streambank. the company’s patent portfolio up for sale next week includes 107 issued patents and 83 pending applications. the 20-year-old company has already seen its early work in foundational ar patents pay off. in 2014, microsoft paid around $150 million to acquire a trove of odg patents after deciding not to buy the company outright. in documents reviewed by techcrunch, odg highlights a number of ar patents in its collection on which it believes existing products from companies like magic leap, google and facebook infringe, specifically pointing to diagrams of systems like the magic leap one and oculus quest that they claim conflict with its prior art. with a patent sale (spotted first by uploadvr), odg’s leadership is looking to recoup enough to pay back the company’s debts, as well as the employees who worked for months on partial salaries. microsoft paid up to $150m to buy wearable computing ip from the osterhout design group whether or not odg’s downfall was largely a cause of mismanagement, the disparity between acquisition offers and its 2016 valuation showcases a broader cooldown in the augmented reality industry, as capital-intensive efforts in enterprise and hardware have proven to be a more difficult sell for investors heading into 2019. last month, blippar, an enterprise-focused ar startup that raised more than $130 million, collapsed after failing to secure an emergency influx of cash. just yesterday, it was reported that meta, an ar hardware startup with $73 million in funding from y combinator, tencent and comcast, had fallen into insolvency. magic leap itself has had issues breaking into broader markets: in november the startup lost out to microsoft on a $480 million military contract. asked whether they would pin the company’s failures on the broader industry slowdown, a former employee said, “from an internal standpoint, all i saw was, we are fucking it up.” ralph osterhout did not respond to a request for comment."
"facebook’s crack down on non-consensual ad targeting last year will finally produce results. in march, techcrunch discovered facebook planned to require advertisers to pledge that they had permission to upload someone’s phone number or email address for ad targeting. that tool debuted in june, though there was no verification process and facebook just took businesses at their word despite the financial incentive to lie. in november, facebook launched a way for ad agencies and marketing tech developers to specify who they were buying promotions “on behalf of.” soon that information will finally be revealed to users. facebook’s new custom audiences transparency feature shows when your contact info was uploaded and by whom, and if it was shared between brands and partners facebook previously only revealed what brand was using your contact info for targeting, not who uploaded it or when starting february 28th, facebook’s “why am i seeing this?” button in the drop-down menu of feed posts will reveal more than the brand that paid for the ad, some biographical details they targeted and if they’d uploaded your contact info. facebook will start to show when your contact info was uploaded, if it was by the brand or one of their agency/developer partners and when access was shared between partners. a facebook spokesperson tells me the goal is to keep giving people a better understanding of how advertisers use their information. this new level of transparency could help users pinpoint what caused a brand to get hold of their contact info. that might help them change their behavior to stay more private. the system could also help facebook zero in on agencies or partners that are constantly uploading contact info and might not have attained it legitimately. apparently seeking not to dredge up old privacy problems, facebook didn’t publish a blog post about the change but simply announced it in a facebook post to the facebook advertiser hub page. the move comes in the wake of facebook attaching immediately visible “paid for by” labels to more political ads to defend against election interference. with so many users concerned about how facebook exploits their data, the custom audiences transparency feature could provide a small boost of confidence in a time when people have little faith in the social network’s privacy practices."
"news media company theskimm is delving further into podcasting, with the launch of its first daily news podcast called skimm this, set to launch on march 4. similar to how theskimm’s morning newsletter helps people keep up with the latest goings-on in the world, the new podcast also aims to help readers quickly understand the news of the day. however, skimm this will be different from other news podcasts currently on the market, the company says. for starters, it will be released in the evenings — monday through friday at 5 pm — in order to reach people hitting the gym after work, commuters on their way home, or those who like to listen to podcasts during dinner prep, among others. and, it will not be a round-up of the day’s headlines, like other news podcasts. instead, skimm this will focus on around four stories in total over the course of about 10 minutes. the top story will always be a national or international subject, and the podcast’s goal will be to provide more context and clarity around this story to help listeners understand why it’s important. in addition, the company positions itself as a nonpartisan news source that only delivers facts, not opinions. more than half its audience said that’s what they wanted from a podcast, along with making the news relatable and easier to understand, the company notes. plus, theskimm’s own data indicated that one-quarter (24 percent) of its female millennial users use podcasts to listen to news, and among those who do, 60 percent listen every day. this isn’t the first podcast to launch from theskimm. in february 2018, it launched skimm’d from the couch, a weekly podcast series where theskimm’s co-founders and co-ceos carly zakin and danielle weisberg interview female leaders — like arianna huffington, taraji p. henson, whitney wolfe, katrina lake, reshma saujani, martha stewart and hoda kotb — about their path to success. the company also previously invested in other media programming, including skimm’d with… and get off the couch for facebook, and digital series sip n’ skimm. but with skimm this, the company is making a play to become more of a part of users’ daily routines — one which begins in the morning with the daily email newsletter that now reaches 7 million+ readers, continues throughout the day through theskimm app calendar integration (which reminds you of important events) and now concludes in the evening with skimm this. theskimm says it’s working with podcast and media company cadence13 on skimm this, and will distribute it to apple podcasts, google play and google’s android app, stitcher, tunein, spotify, iheart and radio.com. there will also be a “flash briefing” version of skimm this available at launch, where it will join the existing daily skimm briefing available on alexa and google home. the podcasting expansion comes at time when theskimm’s growth for its newsletter business appears to have leveled off. last may, when the company reported its $12 million series c funding round with big names like shonda rhimes and tyra banks attached, it said its daily newsletter reached around 7 million subscribers. that’s roughly the same figure it’s reporting today. the power of those readers is notable, though. since announcing the launch of skimm this in today’s morning newsletter, the new podcast’s trailer shot to no. 1 on itunes’ charts, in the news & politics section (according to podbay.fm data.) below is the trailer for skimm this:"
"thirteen-year facebook veteran, chief product officer and the spirit animal of the social network chris cox is departing the company after two years of seeking to do something new. cox’s exit is part of a big executive reshuffle as facebook embarks on prioritizing privacy through messaging, groups, stories and back-end unification of its chat features. ceo mark zuckerberg explained the departure of his long-time friend, saying, “for a few years, chris has been discussing with me his desire to do something else . . . but after 2016, we both realized we had too much important work to do to improve our products for society, and he stayed to help us work through these issues and help us chart a course for our family of apps going forward. at this point, we have made real progress . . .  as we embark on this next major chapter, chris has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams.” vp of whatsapp chris daniels leaves facebook cox bowing out after so long is understandable, but more surprising is today’s departure of chris daniels, an eight-year employee who was moved from being head of internet.org to vp of whatsapp just last may in a major re-org. daniels always felt like a strange choice to oversee international chat leader whatsapp and its struggles with misinformation in india, given he’d led internet.org when its zero-rated free basics app was banned in india for violating net neutrality. the changes solidify that facebook is entering a new era as it chases the trend of feed sharing giving way to private communication. cox and daniels may feel they’ve done their part advancing facebook’s product, and that the company needs renewed energy as it shifts from a relentless growth focus to keeping its users loyal while learning to monetize a new from of social networking. here’s the breakdown of the executive changes: chris cox will depart facebook, but hasn’t revealed plans for what’s next. he will not be immediately replaced chris daniels will leave whatsapp, and facebook declined to provide any details on why or the circumstances will cathcart will go from running the main facebook app to vp of whatsapp fidji simo, who was the vp of product for facebook video, news and advertising, will take over cathcart’s role running facebook’s main app javier olivan, who was facebook’s vp of growth, will lead the task of identifying how to integrate facebook’s products, including the plan to unify the backend of facebook messenger, whatsapp and instagram direct to expand encryption and allow cross-app messaging that some see as a shield against facebook being broken up instagram vp adam mosseri, messenger’s vp stan chudnovsky, simo, and cathcart will now report directly to  zuckerberg, while chief marketing officer antonio lucio reports to coo sheryl sandberg cox was one of facebook’s first 15 engineers, joining in 2005 after zuckerberg convinced him to drop out of a stanford grad program. he became facebook’s director of human resources and, in 2008, its vp of product. he was promoted to cpo in 2014 and aided in facebook’s clean-up after the 2016 presidential election, working on misinformation and at-risk countries to deter future attacks on democracy. over the years, he remained a fixture of zuckerberg’s inner circle of friends and lieutenants. oh, and he’s a wicked keyboardist who plays is a very respectable reggae band. known for his hit talk revealing the timeline profile at f8 2011 and giving rousing orientation speeches to each batch of new facebook employees, cox’s departure could drag on facebook’s already shaky morale. some staffers saw him as a preferred replacement for zuckerberg should he ever leave the ceo role. that leaves the line of succession an open question at facebook, with sandberg, olivan and mosseri as the most likely candidates. cox was seen as so essential that facebook filed an 8-k disclosure with the sec about his departure. the biggest clue to cox’s departure might be the juxtaposition of a line from his departure note with one from zuckerberg’s. cox writes about redefining facebook around privacy and encryption that “this will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through.” meanwhile, zuckerberg wrote “will [cathcart] has helped lead our teams focused on security and integrity, and he believes deeply in providing end-to-end encryption to everyone in the world across our services.” reading between the lines, it seems cathcart was more enthusiastic about executing facebook’s new roadmap of encryption than cox. some consider encryption as a potential hinderance to other safety work, as it could make it difficult to detect the spread of misinformation or illegal activity. techcrunch’s investigation into child sexual abuse imagery on whatsapp revealed that its end-to-end encryption makes it much tougher to catch bad actors. whatsapp has an encrypted child porn problem the change in priority from growth to sustainability through privacy is cemented by olivan’s new responsibilities. while rarely in the spotlight, his team was seen as one of the most important and powerful at the company. his talents will be applied to making facebook’s apps work together to prevent churn of its enormous user base, which will take careful product design and a savvy understanding of people’s expectations. instagram and whatsapp have become golden geese for facebook, and olivan will have to ensure they’re not tarnished through deeper connections to facebook’s battered brand. mark zuckerberg’s blog post hey everyone — i want to share some important updates as we organize our company to build out the privacy-focused social platform i discussed in my note last week. embarking on this new vision represents the start of a new chapter for us. as part of this, i’m sad to share the news that chris cox has decided to leave the company. chris and i have worked closely together to build our products for more than a decade and i will always appreciate his deep empathy for the people using our services and the uplifting spirit he brings to everything he does. he has played so many central roles at facebook — starting as an engineer on our original news feed, building our first hr teams and helping to define our mission and values, leading our product and design teams, running the facebook app, and most recently overseeing the strategy for our family of apps. along the way, chris has helped train many great leaders who are now in important roles across the company — including some who will now take on bigger roles in our new product efforts. for a few years, chris has been discussing with me his desire to do something else. he is one of the most talented people i know and he has the potential to do anything he wants. but after 2016, we both realized we had too much important work to do to improve our products for society, and he stayed to help us work through these issues and help us chart a course for our family of apps going forward. at this point, we have made real progress on many issues and we have a clear plan for our apps, centered around making private messaging, stories and groups the foundation of the experience, including enabling encryption and interoperability across our services. as we embark on this next major chapter, chris has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams. i will really miss chris, but mostly i am deeply grateful for everything he has done to build this place and serve our community. at the same time, as we embark on this new chapter, chris daniels has also decided to leave the company. chris has also done great work in many roles, including running our business development team, leading internet.org, which has helped more than 100 million people get access to the internet, and most recently at whatsapp, where he has helped define the business model for our messaging services going forward. chris is one of the clearest and most principled business thinkers i’ve met and the diversity of challenges he has helped us navigate is impressive. i’ve really enjoyed working with chris and i’m sure he will do great work at whatever he chooses to take on next. while it is sad to lose such great people, this also creates opportunities for more great leaders who are energized about the path ahead to take on new and bigger roles. i’m excited that will cathcart will be the new head of whatsapp. will is one of the most talented leaders at our company — always focused on solving the most important problems for people and clear-eyed about the challenges and tradeoffs we face. most recently he has done a great job running the facebook app, where he has led our shift to focusing on meaningful social interactions and has significantly improved the performance and reliability of the app. in his career here, will has helped lead our teams focused on security and integrity, and he believes deeply in providing end-to-end encryption to everyone in the world across our services. i’m also excited that fidji simo will be the new head of the facebook app. she is one of our most talented product and organizational leaders — passionate about building community and supporting creativity, and focused on building strong teams and developing future leaders. she has played key roles in building many aspects of the facebook app, including leading our work on video and advertising. she believes deeply in helping people get more value out of the networks they’ve built. she has already led this team for much of last year while will was out on parental leave, and she is the clear person to lead these efforts going forward. our family of apps strategy has been led jointly by chris cox and javier olivan. chris managed the leaders of the apps directly and javi has been responsible for all of the central product services that work across our apps, including safety and integrity, analytics, growth, and ads. javi will now lead identifying where our apps should be more integrated. javi is an incredibly thoughtful, strategic and analytical leader, and i’m confident this work will continue to go well. since we have now decided on the basic direction of our family of apps for the next few years, i do not plan on immediately appointing anyone to fill chris’s role in the near term. instead, the leaders of facebook (fidji simo), instagram (adam mosseri), messenger (stan chudnovsky), and whatsapp (will cathcart) will report directly to me, and our chief marketing officer (antonio lucio) will report directly to sheryl. this is an important change as we begin the next chapter of our work building the privacy-focused social foundation for the future. i’m deeply grateful for everything chris cox and chris daniels have done here, and i’m looking forward to working with will and fidji in their new roles as well as everyone who will be critical to achieving this vision. we have so much important work ahead and i’m excited to continue working to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.  chris cox’s facebook post it is with great sadness i share with you that after thirteen years, i’ve decided to leave the company. since i was twenty-three, i’ve poured myself into these walls. the pixels, the code, the products we’ve built together, the language, the culture, the values, the big ideas, and most of all, the people. most all my personal highs and lows of the last decade have been tied up in the journey of this company, with mark, and with so many of you. this place will forever be a part of me. on monday i gave my last orientation at facebook to a hundred new faces. for over a decade, i’ve been sharing the same message that mark and i have always believed: social media’s history is not yet written, and its effects are not neutral. it is tied up in the richness and complexity of social life. as its builders we must endeavor to understand its impact — all the good, and all the bad — and take up the daily work of bending it towards the positive, and towards the good. this is our greatest responsibility. as mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network. it’s a product vision attuned to the subject matter of today: a modern communications platform that balances expression, safety, security, and privacy. this will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through. i’m proud of the team who will succeed me: fidji, will, adam, stan, and antonio. they are strong leaders, serious thinkers, good managers, craftspeople, and most importantly, deeply good people. i trust that, along with mark, they will carry on the work of building out our platforms in a way that honors the responsibilities we have to the billions of people who rely upon our tools each day. mark, thank you for creating this place, and for the chance to work beside a dear friend for over thirteen years. thank you sheryl, schrep, and javi for your partnership, and for showing me what a wise and dedicated team is meant to be. and to the company: thank you for your creativity, humanity, resilience, and sleepless nights. it has been an honor to work alongside you and i will miss you dearly. -chris"
"facebook’s gaming efforts and challenge to twitch are taking another big leap today, as the social network begins the initial rollout of a dedicated facebook gaming tab in the main navigation of facebook’s app. the goal with the new addition is to help people more easily find games, streamers and gaming groups they follow, as well as discover new content, based on their interests. after clicking the new gaming tab, there will be a feed of content that points to instant games you can play with friends; videos to watch from top streamers, esports organizations and game publishers; and updates from your various gaming groups, the company says. the new facebook gaming tab builds on the gaming video destination the site launched last year as fb.gg. that hub had offered a collection of all the video games streaming on facebook, and a way for gamers and fans to interact. as a top-level navigation item, facebook’s new gaming tab will now further extend the gaming hub’s reach. while twitch and youtube are today dominating the gaming space, facebook’s advantage — beyond its scale — is its promise of a reduced cut of transactions. on fb.gg, gamers were able to attract new fans with the aid of facebook’s personalized recommendations based on users’ activity, and then monetize those viewers through a virtual tipping mechanism. facebook’s cut of those tips ranges from 5 to 30 percent, with the cut getting smaller when users buy larger packs of the virtual currency. meanwhile, facebook’s fan subscriptions payments for streamers also see it taking a cut of up to 30 percent, the same as youtube but smaller than twitch’s roughly 50 percent. that could potentially attract streamers who want to maximize their earnings and believe they can port their audience over to a new destination. of course, some streamers may not trust facebook to maintain those same percentages over time, nor believe it will ever offer the sorts of features and innovations that a more focused gaming destination like twitch can. facebook also last year experimented with making its gaming hub mobile with the launch of fb.gg as a standalone mobile app. the app, like the web-based gaming hub, offered a way for gamers and fans to discover content, join communities and even play instant games like everwing, words with friends, basketball frvr and others. however, the strategy of keeping facebook’s gaming efforts more separated from facebook’s main site may not have paid off — the fb.gg android app, for example, only has some 100,000+ installs according to google play. instead, much like youtube recently decided, facebook will now leverage the power of its platform to boost interest in its gaming content. youtube in september said it was giving its gaming hub a new home right on the youtube homepage, and would shut down its standalone gaming app. (the latter doesn’t seem to have occurred, however). as youtube noted, gaming was a popular category, but the majority of viewers weren’t looking for a separate app or experience — they were just visiting youtube directly. similarly, facebook today says that more than 700 million people play games, watch gaming videos or engage in gaming groups on facebook. that’s a far larger number than those who downloaded the fb.gg app, and surely a much larger number than those who have been visiting the fb.gg destination directly. that said, facebook is continuing its tests on mobile with a standalone (rebranded) facebook gaming app on android, which will have more features that the gaming tab. facebook says it will roll out the gaming tab to a subset of the more than 700 million facebook game fans, and will expand it over time to more gaming enthusiasts across the network. if you don’t see the new tab in your main navigation bar, you can still find it by going to the bookmarks menu on facebook."
"hardware, as the saying goes, is hard, but today a startup has raised some money for a manufacturing platform that it believes can make the prospect of starting and running hardware businesses a little easier. fictiv, which positions itself as a kind of aws for manufacturing — providing a platform both to design components and help get them produced — has raised $33 million, money that it will use to continue expanding its production ecosystem, the range of components that it can make and to grow its customer base. the company is not disclosing its valuation, but, according to pitchbook, fictiv was valued at around $65 million post-money in its last fundraise, which could put the company at around $100 million with this latest injection. this series c was led by g2vp, with new strategic investor mitsui & co. and previous backers accel, bill gates, intel capital, sinovation and tandon group also participating. fictiv has raised $58 million to date. “injection” may be the operative word here — or at least one of them. fictiv today works across manufacturing plants in china and the bay area, covering a range of processes, including injection molding, cnc machining, 3d printing and urethane casting, covering a variety of materials. customers use the company’s cloud-based software to design and order parts, which are routed by fictiv to the plants best suited to make them. “fictiv does not own any machines, we are a cloud based network of hundreds of manufacturers both domestic and overseas. today, that is mostly centered in the us and china, but this round will enable us to strategically grow our network to add new capabilities, increase access to materials and provide customers with additional capacity. but it’s important to note that our goal is not to build the world’s largest network of manufacturers, rather it’s highest quality network,” wrote dave evans, the ceo and co-founder (with nate evans) of fictiv, in an emailed interview. current customers include the likes of sphero and facebook, which has used fictiv’s services for prototyping and creating small runs of devices (like the one pictured above). the problem that fictiv is solving has been a persistent one in the world of hardware: making prototypes can cost a lot and be very inefficient, and that’s before you move into full-scale manufacturing, which can be challenging even with economies of scale. it’s also a very crowded field, with a number of different companies all vying to help fill the role of manufacturing enabler (and it is a field also littered with failures). but over the years, we’ve seen a lot of advances in manufacturing tech, with the trade-off that some of the work it takes on freeing up staff to work on other challenges. more recently, companies have been feeling an extra squeeze by way of the trade tensions between the u.s., a key market for sales, and china, which has a strong hold on efficient and cheap manufacturing (as well as an interesting and large sales market). “the uncertainty companies feel under the threat of trade wars are forcing the industry to shine a light on the lack of investment that has been made in manufacturing technology,” evans said. “threats of tariffs and trade wars are not new, but that, along with other pressures like materials shortages, amplify the need for product companies to think about how to build responsive supply chains. today’s supply chains can take years to establish, and those time frames do not align with the speed of innovation and the responsiveness required by product companies today. designers and developers must design supply chains that are equally nimble and agile. that’s the role of fictiv.” the aws comparison that fictiv likes to use extends not only to the concept that amazon has perfected — of outsourcing expensive aspects of an operation to a third-party that can reduce the cost through economies of scale — but also to the emphasis on using cloud services to speed up certain processes. the company’s aim, evans said, is to enable designers to “create hardware at the speed of software.” evans himself was the first hire for ford’s innovation lab in silicon valley, overseeing prototyping infotainment systems in automotive dashboards. “my frustration trying to source vendors and manage supply chains — especially while i watched my software colleagues fire through new cycles at incredible speed — directly motivated me to create fictiv,” he said. the company has attracted “intense interest” from backers in part also because of this problem, he added. “investors and others realize that manufacturing — like other industries before it [such as] finance, retail, travel — is having its technology moment,” he said. “we are excited to be part of the digital transformation of the status quo in manufacturing,” said ​daniel oros​, partner at g2vp, in a statement. “fictiv’s innovative tools and services address the critical gap in contract manufacturing that will lead to a massive shift in how consumer and industrial products are manufactured.”"
"apple is telling app developers to remove or properly disclose their use of analytics code that allows them to record how a user interacts with their iphone apps — or face removal from the app store, techcrunch can confirm. in an email, an apple spokesperson said: “protecting user privacy is paramount in the apple ecosystem. our app store review guidelines require that apps request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity.” “we have notified the developers that are in violation of these strict privacy terms and guidelines, and will take immediate action if necessary,” the spokesperson added. it follows an investigation by techcrunch that revealed major companies, like expedia, hollister and hotels.com, were using a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app. we found that none of the apps we tested asked the user for permission, and none of the companies said in their privacy policies that they were recording a user’s app activity. even though sensitive data is supposed to be masked, some data — like passport numbers and credit card numbers — was leaking. glassbox is a cross-platform analytics tool that specializes in session replay technology. it allows companies to integrate its screen recording technology into their apps to replay how a user interacts with the apps. glassbox says it provides the technology, among many reasons, to help reduce app error rates. but the company “doesn’t enforce its customers” to mention that they use glassbox’s screen recording tools in their privacy policies. but apple expressly forbids apps that covertly collect data without a user’s permission. techcrunch began hearing on thursday that app developers had already been notified that their apps had fallen afoul of apple’s rules. one app developer was told by apple to remove code that recorded app activities, citing the company’s app store guidelines. “your app uses analytics software to collect and send user or device data to a third party without the user’s consent. apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity,” apple said in the email. apple gave the developer less than a day to remove the code and resubmit their app or the app would be removed from the app store, the email said. when asked if glassbox was aware of the app store removals, a spokesperson for glassbox said that “the communication with apple is through our customers.” glassbox is also available to android app developers. google did not immediately comment if it would also ban the screen recording code. google play also expressly prohibits apps from secretly collecting device usage. “apps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality,” the developer rules state. we’ll update if and when we hear back. it’s the latest privacy debacle that has forced apple to wade in to protect its customers after apps were caught misbehaving. last week, techcrunch reported that apple banned facebook’s “research” app that the social media giant paid teenagers to collect all of their data. it followed another investigation by techcrunch that revealed facebook misused its apple-issued enterprise developer certificate to build and provide apps for consumers outside apple’s app store. apple temporarily revoked facebook’s enterprise developer certificate, knocking all of the company’s internal ios apps offline for close to a day. many popular iphone apps secretly record your screen without asking"
"breaking up tech giants should be a measure of last resort, the european union’s competition commissioner, margrethe vestager, has suggested. “to break up a company, to break up private property would be very far reaching and you would need to have a very strong case that it would produce better results for consumers in the marketplace than what you could do with more mainstream tools,” she warned this weekend, speaking in a sxsw interview with recode’s kara swisher. “we’re dealing with private property. businesses that are built and invested in and become successful because of their innovation.” vestager has built a reputation for being feared by tech giants, thanks to a number of major (and often expensive) interventions since she took up the commission antitrust brief in 2014, with still one big outstanding investigation hanging over google. but while opposition politicians in many western markets — including high profile would-be u.s. presidential candidates — are now competing on sounding tough on tech, the european commissioner advocates taking a scalpel to data streams rather than wielding a break-up hammer to smash market-skewing tech giants. “when it comes to the very far reaching proposal to split up companies, for us, from a european perspective, that would be a measure of last resort,” she said. “what we do now, we do the antitrust cases, misuse of dominant position, the tying of products, the self-promotion, the demotion of others, to see if that approach will correct and change the marketplace to make it a fair place where there’s no misuse of dominant position but where smaller competitors can have a fair go. because they may be the next big one, the next one with the greatest idea for consumers.” she also pointed to an agreement last month, between key european political institutions on regulating online platform transparency, as an example of the kind of fairness-focused intervention she believes can work to counter market imbalance. the bread and butter work regulators should be focused on where big tech is concerned are things like digital sector enquiries and hearings to examine how markets are operating in detail, she suggested — using careful scrutiny to inform and shape intelligent, data-led interventions. albeit ‘break up google’ clearly makes for a punchier political soundbite. vestager is, however, in the final months of her term as antitrust chief — with the commission due to turn over this year. her time at the antitrust helm will end on november 1, she confirmed. (though she remains, at least tentatively, on a shortlist of candidates who could be appointed the next european commission president.) the commissioner has spoken up before about regulating access to data as a more interesting option for controlling digital giants vs breaking them up. and some european regulators appear to be moving in that direction already. such the german federal cartel office (fco) which last month announced a decision against facebook which aims to limit how it can use data from its own services. the fco’s move has been couched as akin to an internal break up of the company, at the data level, without the tech giant having to be forced to separate and sell off business units like instagram and whatsapp. it’s perhaps not surprising, therefore, that facebook founder mark zuckerberg announced a massive plan to merge all three services at the technical level just last week — billing the switch to encrypted content but merged metadata as a ‘pro-privacy’ move, while clearly also intending to restructure his empire in a way that works against regulatory interventions that separate and control internal data flows at the product level. *lol* so @facebook merges all the data from #instagram, #whatsapp and #facebook, while only encrypting the content data (not the meta data) of facebook messages and sells the package as a #privacy move – a pr masterpiece and the media falls for it.. 😜😂 — max schrems 🇪🇺🇦🇹 (@maxschrems) march 7, 2019 the competition commission does not have a formal probe of facebook or the social media sector open at this point but vestager said her department does have its eye on how social media giants are using data. “we’re sort of hoovering over social media, facebook — how data’s being used in that respect,” she said, also flagging the preliminary work it’s doing looking into amazon’s use of merchant data. (also still not yet a formal probe.) “the good thing is now the debate is really sort of taking off,” she added, of competition regulation generally. “when i’ve been visiting and speaking with people on the hill previously, i’ve sensed a new sort of interest and curiosity as to what can competition achieve for you in a society. because if you have fair competition then you have markets serving the citizen in our role as consumer and not the other way around.” asked whether she’s personally convinced by facebook’s sudden ‘appreciation’ of privacy vestager said if the announcement signifies a genuine change of philosophy and direction which leads to shifts in its business practices it would be good news for consumers. though she said she’s not simply taking zuckerberg at his word at this point. “it may be a little far-reaching to assume the best,” she said politely when pushed by swisher on whether she believed a sincere pivot is possible from a company with such a long privacy-hostile history. big tech, small tax the interview also delved into the issue of big tech and the tiny amounts it pays in tax. reforming the global tax system so digital businesses pay a fair share vs traditional businesses is now “urgent” work to do, said vestager — highlighting how the lack of a consensus position among eu member states is pushing some countries to move forward with their own measures, given resistance to commission proposals from other corners of the bloc. france‘s push for a tax on tech giants this year is “absolutely necessary but very unfortunate”, vestager said. “when you do numbers that can be compared we see that digital businesses they would pay on average nine per cent [in taxes] where traditional businesses on average pay 23 per cent,” she continued. “yet they’re in the same market for capital, for skilled employees, sometimes competing for the same customers. so obviously this is not fair.” the commission’s hope is that individual “pushes” from member states frustrated by the current tax imbalance will generate momentum for “a european-wide way of doing things” — and therefore that any fragmentation of tax policies across the bloc will be short-lived. she also she europe is keen for the organisation for economic co-operation and development to “push forward for this” too, remarking: “because we sense in the oecd that a number of places in the world take an interest also in the u.s. side of things.” is the better way to reset inequalities related to big tech and society achieved via reforming the tax system or are regulators doomed to have to keep fining them “into the next century”, wondered swisher. “you get a fine when you do something illegal. you pay your taxes to contribute to society where you do your business. these are two different things and we definitely need both,” responded vestager. “but we cannot have a situation where some businesses do not contribute and the majority of businesses they do. because it’s simply not fair in the marketplace or fair towards citizens if this continues.” she also made short shrift of the favored big tech lobbyist line — to loudly claim privacy regulation helps big guys because it’s easier for them to fund compliance — by pointing out that europe’s general data protection regulation has “different brackets” and does not simply clobber big and small alike with the same requirements. of course small businesses “don’t have the same obligations as google”, said vestager. “i’d say if they find it easy, i’d say they can do better,” she added, raising the much complained about consumer rights issue of consent vs inscrutable t&cs. “because i still find that it’s quite tricky to understand what it is that you accept when you accept your terms and conditions. and i think it would be great if we as citizens could really say ‘oh this is what i am signing up to and i’m perfectly happy with that’.” though she admitted there’s still a way to go for european privacy rights to be fully functioning as intended — arguing it’s still too hard for individual consumers to exercise the rights they have in law. “i know i own my data but i really do not know how to exercise that ownership,” she said. “how to allow for more people to have access to my data if i want to enable innovation, new market participants coming in. if that was done in large scale you could have an innovative input into the marketplace and we’re definitely not there yet,” she said. asked about the idea of taxing data flows as another possible means of clipping the wings of big tech vestager pointed to early signs of an intermediate market spinning up in europe to help individual extract value from what corporate entities are doing with their information. so not literally a tax on data flows but a way for consumers to claw back some of the value that’s being stripped from them. “it’s still nascent in europe but since now we have the rights that establishes your ownership of your data we see there is a beginning market development of intermediaries saying should i enable you yourself to monetize your data, so it’s not just the giants who monetize your data. so that maybe you get a sum every month reflecting how your data has been passed on,” she said. “that is one opportunity.” she also said the commission is looking at how to make sure “huge amounts of data will not be a barrier to entry in a marketplace” — or present a barrier to innovation for newcomers. the latter being key given how tech giants’ massive data pools are translating into a meaty advantage in ai r&d. in another interesting exchange, vestager suggested the convenience of voice interfaces presents an acute competition challenge — given how the tech could naturally concentrate market power via preferring quick-fire q&a style interactions which don’t support offering lots of choice options. “one of the things that is really mindboggling for us is how to have choice if you have voice,” she said, arguing that voice assistance dynamic doesn’t lend itself to multiple suggestions being offered every time a user asks a question. “so how to have competition when you have voice search?.. how would this change the marketplace and how would we deal with such a market? so this is what we’re trying to figure out.” again she suggested regulators are thinking about how data flows behind the scenes as a potential route to remedying interfaces that work against choice. “we’re trying to figure out how access to data will change the marketplace,” she added. “can you give a different access to data because the one who holds the data, also holds the resources for innovation. and we cannot rely on the big guys to be the innovative ones.” asked for her worst case scenario for tech 10 years hence, she said it would be to have “all of the technology but none of the societal positive oversight and direction”. on the flip side, the best case would be for legislators to be “willing to take sufficient steps in taxation and in regulating access to data and fairness in the marketplace”. “we would also need to see technology develop to have new players,” she emphasized. “because we still need to see what will happen with quantum computing, what will happen with blockchain, what other uses are there for all if that new technology. because i still think that it holds a lot of promise. but only if our democracy will give it direction. then you will have a positive outcome.”"
"if you’re a video creator in 2019, you’re probably thinking about a long list of publishing destinations: youtube, of course, but also facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat and more. staytuned digital is a new startup trying to help video creators and publishers push their content to multiple platforms. the company, which bills itself as “content’s best friend,” is officially unveiling its product today and announcing that it’s raised $2.5 million in funding. staytuned was founded by ceo serge kassardjian (previously the global head of media app business development for google play) and randy jimenez (previously cto at singleplatform). kassardjian told me he saw the need for a product like this during his time at google, when he would talk to content creators becoming “overwhelmed” by the fragmentation across all the different devices and platforms available to them. “what’s happened is every single one of the platforms is releasing new formats, new ways to optimize, it’s constantly changing every couple of months,” kassardjian said. so with staytuned, publishers shouldn’t have to worry about all that. kassardjian said the product does three big things: optimizes the video so it looks good and can perform well on each platform, pushes the video to each platform and then measures the results, which feeds back into the optimization. buzzfeed will cut its staff by 15% in major round of layoffs kassardjian acknowledged that getting into the media business, even as a technology provider, might seem like a bad idea right now, but he said, “there’s a misconception that what’s happening in the world is that media and content is dead, but there’s more media and content than ever before.” nor does kassardjian believe that publishers can stop relying on facebook and other platforms. sure, they may want to drive more traffic to their own properties or launch their own subscription services, but unless they’re netflix-sized, they can’t ignore the big platforms entirely. “we provide ubiquity to where the audience is,” he said. and when he talks about video publishers, he isn’t just thinking about traditional media companies (although he’s looking to work with them too). he also said staytuned could work with newer digital companies, e-commerce retailers and other brands that are creating content — and eventually, small businesses. as for the funding, it was led by bowery capital, with participation from courtsidevc, quaker health, social leverage, liquid 2 ventures, the fund, hive ventures, grape arbor and a number of angel investors. staytuned is also part of the current gct startup-in-residence program."
"the washington post is reporting that facebook’s row with the ftc could result in fines an order of magnitude larger than any levied against a tech company by the regulatory body before. while the talks appear to be ongoing, the washington post spoke with two people familiar with the situation who said the ftc is negotiating with facebook over a possible “multi-billion dollar fine” — an amount more in line with the ftc’s massive $14.7 billion settlement with volkswagen over emissions cheating in 2016. in 2012, google paid a record-setting $22.5 million to settle with the ftc over its own privacy infractions, an amount that is hardly a drop in the bucket by today’s terms. as we’ve previously reported, an ftc fine around that range — or even a multiple of that amount — would be easily shrugged off by the company, which brought in more than $13 billion in revenues in just one quarter of last year. hitting facebook with fines well beyond the millions is one of the only ways to punish a company so wealthy that paying out millions would be little more than a passing annoyance. when contacted about the state of talks with the ftc, facebook repeated a prior statement on regulatory compliance. “we are cooperating with officials in the us, uk, and beyond,” a facebook spokesperson told techcrunch. “we’ve provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues.” assuming the ftc holds its ground in negotiations over a record-blowing fine against facebook, the company is likely to push back hard in court, putting its vast financial resources to the work of insulating it from meaningful penalties both in the present and future. whether the multi-billion-dollar fine materializes or not, the hefty sum would be a major symbol of facebook’s recent privacy transgressions and the process would likely hold facebook to account with some transparency and reporting measures that could be bruising, even if it didn’t pay up. facebook fears no ftc fine"
"facebook will drive a hard bargain with influencers and artists judging by the terms of service for the social network’s patreon-like fan subscriptions feature that lets people pay a monthly fee for access to a creator’s exclusive content. the policy document attained by techcrunch shows facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut of subscription revenue minus fees, compared to 5 percent by patreon, 30 percent by youtube, which covers fees and 50 percent by twitch. facebook also reserves the right to offer free trials to subscriptions that won’t compensate creators. and facebook demands a “non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use” creators’ content and “this license survives even if you stop using fan subscriptions.” distrust of facebook could scare creators away from the platform when combined with its significant revenue share and ability to give away or repurpose creators’ content. facebook has consistently shown that it puts what it thinks users want and its own interests above those of partners. it cut off game developers from viral channels, inadequately warned page owners their reach would drop over time, decimated referral traffic to news publishers and, most recently, banished video makers from the feed. if facebook wants to win creators’ trust and the engagement of their biggest fans, it may need a more competitive offering with larger limits on its power. “facebook reached out to offer hard drive early access to a ‘fan subscription’ product” tweeted matt saincome, who also runs satirical news site the hard times. “i asked my editors about it and the complete distrust amongst our team was kinda funny. we read through the terms and found a couple things that were hilarious when compared to patreon’s 5% . . . up to 30% and the rights to all our stuff? from the people who let us build an audience on their platform before pulling it out from under our feet? hilarious. here’s a crazy alternative: let people who signed up to see our content see it and then we can monetize that hahah.” instagram is refocusing on creators too. instagram’s android app reveals the prototype of a feature that lets users switch their profile into a creator account, similar to the business profiles it launched in 2016. instagram first told the hollywood reporter about creator accounts in december, but now it’s showing up in the code. reverse-engineering specialist jane manchun wong generated this screenshot showing the option for creator accounts to hide their contact info or profile category. fellow code digger ishan agarwal gave techcrunch an exclusive look at the instagram code that shows the creator accounts are “best for public figures, content producers, artists, and influencers.” creator accounts give users “more advanced insights and reach more people with promotions,” “more growth tools” and “a new inbox that makes it easier to manage message requests and connect with fans.” trading control for subscribers facebook began testing fan subscriptions a year ago to give creators a financial alternative to maximizing ad views after watching the rise of patreon, which now has 3 million patrons who’ll pay 100,000 artists, comedians, models and makers more than $500 million this year. this month facebook expanded the test to the u.k., spain, germany and portugal to allow users to pay $4.99 per month to a creator for exclusive content, live videos and a profile badge that highlights them as a subscriber. while twitch owns gamers, youtube rules amongst videographers and patreon is a favorite with odd-ball creators, facebook may see an opportunity to popularize fan subscriptions internationally and turn mainstream consumers into paid supporters. the terms for fan subscriptions are not publicly available, and only visible on facebook’s site to pages it’s invited to test the feature. but techcrunch has published the full policy document below. thankfully, facebook isn’t taking a cut of fan subscription revenue during the test phase, and creators get to keep 100 percent of the money paid by any patrons it signs up before the official launch. facebook tells me that it hasn’t finalized its percentage cut, though the terms permit it to take as much as 30 percent. that would qualify, given facebook tells me its rake will be in line with industry standards and creators will retain the majority of their earnings. but whatever cut it takes will be after processing fees and the 15 to 30 percent tax apple and google levy on ios and android in-app purchases. we’ll see if facebook tries a workaround that pushes users to their mobile browser where it can take their subscription money tax-free. and if facebook decides it want to give users a free one-month trial or discount to any creator, they can’t stop it even if that lets people download all their exclusive content and then cancel without ever paying. but what’s sure to raise the most hairs is the clause about “supplemental data” that gives facebook a license to display a creator’s content as they might expect, but also a royalty-free license to use it however they want, even after a creator abandons facebook fan subscriptions. a facebook spokesperson confirmed that supplemental data does in fact cover all content provided by the creator. they claim it’s so if a creator made a custom fan sticker, a subscriber could use it in their own facebook post, but the rule gives facebook vast power beyond that. patreon has a similar clause, but gets the benefit of the doubt in a way facebook doesn’t after so many scandals. facebook’s spokesperson claimed that the supplemental data terms were similar to facebook’s standard terms, but the normal facebook terms say “you can end this license any time by deleting your content or account.” not so with fan subscriptions. i don’t expect facebook is going to try to outright steal and resell creators’ content, but it will have jurisdiction to use their art however it wants to fuel its war with patreon, twitch and youtube. creators will have to decide whether access to facebook’s 2.3 billion users is worth the platform risk of building a following somewhere they don’t control and that has other business priorities. if facebook’s strategy suddenly veers away from fan subscriptions, it could be hard for creators to score new signups or retain their old ones. at least with a dedicated site like patreon, creators know the platform can’t abuse them without the threaten of ruin. here’s the full terms of service for facebook’s patreon competitor fan subscriptions: fan subscriptions creator terms the fan funding feature (“fan subscriptions”) allows facebook users to support their favorite pages, creators, group administrators, gamers, or others (“pages”) through a monthly subscription with facebook (“subscription”) that gives those people (“fans”) access to digital content offered by pages, such as exclusive digital content, fan recognition, and merchandise discounts. these terms (“terms”) govern how pages use fan subscriptions. with regard to your use of fan subscriptions, you agree to the following: your use of the platform with respect to fan subscriptions is subject to, and you agree to comply with, the platform policy currently available at https://developers.facebook.com/policy/. your use of fan subscriptions to offer digital content and/or services to facebook fans is subject to, and you agree to comply with the (a) monetization eligibility standards currently available at https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/169845596919485, and (b) content guidelines for monetization currently available at https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/get-started/monetization_contentguidelines. you agree to follow any additional instructions and/or technical documentation we provide to you for fan subscriptions. you will provide accurate information to fans in connection with your use of fan subscriptions, including but not limited as part of any digital content or services you choose to offer to them. you must clearly and conspicuously disclose all material terms regarding your offer and the nature of content or services you will provide to fans once they choose to subscribe. you agree to comply with all laws applicable to your use of fan subscriptions. you confirm that the content you offer via subscription does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party and that you have secured all rights necessary to distribute, copy, display, publicly perform, or otherwise use the content. you will not use, incorporate, or provide any music or physical goods in connection with your use of fan subscriptions without fb’s prior written approval (email is sufficient). you will not offer discounts on physical goods that exceed 80 percent of the offered goods’ retail value. your fans’ subscriptions may be processed as payments to facebook via apple’s in-app purchase or google’s in-app billing services, which are subject to apple’s and google’s separate payment terms and conditions. apple and google may charge facebook a revenue share and/or other fees for such payment services according to their respective terms and conditions. fb will pay you a revenue share calculated as a percentage (“your share”) of what’s left after deduction of those fees/charges and of any other fees or taxes incurred by facebook. as a the date of these terms, your share of that net revenue is 100%. however, facebook may in the future change these terms such that facebook keeps a revenue share of up to 30%. we will give 30 days’ notice of any such change. facebook reserves the right to offer discounted and free trials for fans from time to time in our discretion, whether to incentivize subscription sign-ups or otherwise. where we do so in relation to your fan subscriptions, your revenue share will be reduced accordingly: we only pay you a revenue share based on the amounts fans actually pay (less fees and taxes we incur). if you have accurately completed and timely provided to fb any forms or documentation that fb reasonably determines are required to set up payment to you, and subject to and only in the event that you are in compliance in all respects with these terms, payment of any net amounts fb receives from apple and google for subscriptions made by your fans during your use of fan subscriptions will be on a monthly basis, within approximately 60 days after the end of the applicable month. facebook will not be responsible for any subsequent fees applied by your financial institution to complete payment of the monthly fee to you. furthermore, in the event the payment due to you would be less than one hundred u.s. dollars ($100.00), facebook reserves the right to roll such payment over month to month until such payment threshold is met, at which time facebook will make the applicable payment to you. facebook also reserves the right to set off and/or withhold any amounts that facebook reasonably considers are or are likely to be payable by you to facebook under these terms (including under any indemnities). .if you are providing (or allowing us to access) any data, content, or other information in connection with your use of fan subscriptions (collectively, “supplemental data”), then you grant us (and our affiliates) a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use such supplemental data. this license survives even if you stop using fan subscriptions. you are responsible for obtaining the necessary rights from all applicable rights holders to grant this license. you are responsible for paying any applicable taxes owed with respect to any amounts you receive through your use of fan subscriptions. facebook will charge you taxes with respect to such amounts if it is required to do so under applicable law. .facebook can terminate or suspend your use of fan subscriptions at any time in our sole discretion, and we may change or stop offering fan subscriptions at any time in our sole discretion. in no event will we be liable in any way for terminating or suspending your use of fan subscriptions, for the discontinuation of fan subscriptions, for the removal of or disabling of access to content, or for the withdrawal of the content or fan subscriptions. .if you change what’s included in a subscription in a way that could be considered material, you must give fans reasonable prior notice such that they have a reasonable opportunity to cancel their subscriptions if they so choose, with the change only taking effect after their next subscription fee payment. .if you are using fan subscription on behalf of a third party (including, but not limited to, as an agent or representative of a creator), you represent and warrant that you have the authority as agent of such party to use such features on their behalf, agree to these terms, and hereby bind such party to these terms. you agree to indemnify and hold facebook harmless from any claims, suits, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses resulting from your breach of the terms. if you are accepting these terms as admin of facebook business manager for your business, these terms shall apply to content on all facebook pages and profiles owned or operated by your business at the time of acceptance and thereafter. .by using the fan subscriptions feature, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically any important information regarding your use of fan subscriptions, including without limitation as to your share and any payments. we may also provide notices to you by posting them on our website, or by sending them to an email address or street address that you previously provided to us. website and email notices shall be considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted or sent; notices by postal mail shall be considered received within three (3) business days of the time sent. .facebook reserves the right to update these terms from time to time. if any change to these terms will materially disadvantage you, or materially affect the availability of the subscription, we will provide you with notice before the changes become effective and you can choose to cancel your subscription. your continued use of this feature constitutes acceptance of those changes. .fan subscriptions is part of the “facebook products” under facebook’s terms of service (“facebook terms”), and your use of fan subscriptions is deemed part of your use of facebook products. in the event of any express conflict between these terms and the facebook terms, these terms will govern solely with respect to your use of fan subscriptions and solely to the extent of the conflict. these terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with facebook. facebook reserves the right to monitor or audit your compliance with these terms and to update these terms from time to time, and your continued use of fan subscriptions constitutes acceptance of those changes."
"not all the bots on twitter are spammers or democracy hackers. you may recall seeing requests to the thread reader app bot to “unroll” a long thread into readable copy, for example, and in more recent days you may have spotted twitter users tagging a newer bot, @this_vid, on tweets with a video file attached. the handy bot (aka downloadthisvideo) offers a way to download both videos and gifs from twitter’s site for easier offline viewing. the idea for @this_vid comes from shalvah adebayo, a backend developer born and raised in nigeria, and currently living in lagos. shalvah says he got into development back in 2013, during his final year of secondary school (high school). “there was a kid in a lower class that people talked about in awe — ‘he knows programming!,'” explains shalvah. “i had no idea what it was then,” he continues. “i watched a command-line quiz application he’d made, and i was impressed. i’d won a laptop in a competition a few months back, so the next day, i walked into the only computer shop i knew and asked them for ‘programming videos.’ they gave me something on c++. i watched those at home that day and went back the next day to buy the actual software (the ide). that was how i started writing c++,” he says. since then, shalvah moved from c++ to android development, then web development. he went to university and then quit, and began working in the tech industry. today, shalvah works full-time as a remote software engineer for an engineering consultancy and product design company in south africa called deimos cloud. he builds apps in his spare time as side projects, and has previously open-sourced other bots like @remindme_ofthis, which lets you set reminders by tweets, and twitterthrowback, which is like twitter’s version of facebook’s “on this day” feature. however, the twitter video downloader bot has become one of his more popular creations, and is now seeing around 7,500 user requests per day, and as many as 9,500 at peak times. shalvah explains he got the idea because it was a personal pain point. internet access where he lives can be spotty, and the twitter app’s video experience was not ideal. he said he preferred to download the videos to watch them offline, but couldn’t find any easy way to do so. “i knew of a couple of sites and apps that did that, but i don’t like installing apps, and i didn’t like the friction involved in using a site,” the developer says. “plus, i wanted an asynchronous process, where you could just say ‘hey, i want to download this’ and continue browsing twitter and come back later to pick up your download.” plus, shalvah says he saw a lot of other twitter users asking how they can get the video posted in nearly every popular thread where someone had tweeted a video. the bot, @this_vid, has been up and running since may 2018. after sending it out first to his own followers, shalvah then began to point people to it whenever he saw them asking on a thread how to get a particular video that was shared. this led to its increasing popularity around twitter. “i think it really solved a problem for a lot of people, and that was what made it so popular. so there were quite a lot of people, both friends and strangers, that tweeted about it to their followers, and it just kind of grew organically,” he says. there are some videos that @this_vid can’t download, because the poster — often a sports organization (e.g. the nfl ) — has restricted it from downloads. but in most cases, all you need to do is mention @this_vid in a reply to the original tweet, and you’ll receive a link with the video download in a few minutes. the bot works by querying the twitter api for the tweet data, and then retrieves the media url along with a few other fallbacks. because twitter is rate-limited, allowing the bot only 300 tweets every three hours, shalvah made the download link for each user easy to remember at: download-this.video/twitter_username. that way you can get to your downloads even when the bot can’t reply. the bot itself is free to use, open source and supported through patreon donations. there’s some concern that people could download videos they don’t have the rights to through a bot like this, or publish them elsewhere and take credit. shalvah says he doesn’t believe the bot is in violation of twitter’s copyright policy, developer terms or rules. so far, most people seem to be using the bot for personal use. but twitter hasn’t always been kind to third-party developers, so it remains to be seen how long @this_vid will last. shalvah says he intends to keep @this_vid free and will continue to develop it."

"roughly half of instagram’s 1 billion users now use instagram stories every day. that 500 million daily user count is up from 400 million in june 2018. 2 million advertisers are now buying stories ads across facebook’s properties. ceo mark zuckerberg called stories the last big game-changing feature from facebook, but after concentrating on security last year, it plans to ship more products that make “major improvements” in people’s lives. during today’s q4 2018 earnings call, zuckerberg outlined several areas where facebook will push new products this year: encryption and ephemerality will be added to more features for security and privacy messaging features will make messenger and whatsapp “the center of [your] social experiences” whatsapp payments will expand to more countries stories will gain new private sharing options groups will become an organizing function of facebook on par with friends & family facebook watch will become mainstream this year as video is moved there from the news feed, zuckerberg expects augmented and virtual reality will be improved, and oculus quest will ship this spring instagram commerce and shopping will get new features zuckerberg was asked about facebook’s plan to unify the infrastructure to allow encrypted cross-app messaging between facebook messenger, instagram, and whatsapp, as first reported by nyt’s mike isaac. zuckerberg explained that the plan wasn’t about a business benefit, but supposedly to improve the user experience. specifically, it would allow marketplace buyers and sellers in countries where whatsapp dominates messaging to use that app to chat instead of messenger. and for android users who use messenger as their sms client, the unification would allow those messages to be sent with encryption too. he sees expanding encryption here as a way to decentralize facebook and keep users’ data safe by never having it on the company’s servers. however, zuckerberg says this will take time and could be a “2020 thing”. facebook says it now has 2.7 billion monthly users across the facebook family of apps: facebook, instagram, messenger, and whatsapp. however, facebook cfo david wehner says “over time we expect family metrics to play the primary role in how we talk about our company and we will eventually phase out facebook-only community metrics.” that shows facebook is self-conscious about how its user base is shifting away from its classic social network and towards instagram and its messaging apps. family-only metrics could mask how teens are slipping away."
"facebook has refused to provide the british parliament with the names of individuals behind a shadowy network backing an extreme ‘no deal’ brexit outcome over a government-negotiated compromise. since the june 2016 eu referendum vote, politics in the uk has been consumed by the question of how to implement a close vote to leave. and last year the uk’s electoral commission confirmed the vote was tarnished by in influx of dark money ploughed into social media ads — with platforms such as facebook offering an unregulated route for circumventing democratic norms. nor have the brexit ads stopped since the referendum. an unknown group, called ‘mainstream network’, ran a series of political ads on facebook’s platform last year which targeted voters in key leave voting constituencies urging them to pressure on their member of parliament not to support the prime minister’s approach to seek a withdrawal deal from the eu. such a deal would allow the uk to leave the bloc more smoothly, with more contingencies in place to cover the exit. but legally, if no deal (and/or no extension to article 50) is agreed before the end of this month the uk could just ‘crash out’ of the eu without any such safety net. unknown entities have been using facebook’s platform to push for exactly that to happen — by paying facebook to target leave voters with anti-brexit-deal ads (which included the line “chuck chequers”; a reference to the prime minister’s brexit deal). last year research commissioned by a uk parliamentary committee as part of an enquiry into political advertising online spotlit the existence of mainstream network, estimating the unknown facebook advertiser had spent ~£257,000 in just over 10 months. its facebook pages were said to have reached between 10m and 11m people on the platform. mainstream network also operated a ‘news’ website, where whoever was behind it curated pro-brexit content and advocated for no deal being “better than partition or permanent vassalage”. last november facebook policy vp richard allan faced questions from the dcms committee about who is behind the ‘mainstream network’ brexit ads running on facebook. dcms chair damian collins asked for facebook to provide details of the accounts behind mainstream network or if it would not to provide a reason for not disclosing the information. yesterday the committee published facebook’s refusal to provide the information to the dcms committee. though it said it has passed some information to the uk’s data watchdog, the information commissioner’s office (ico). “the committee asked about an advertiser on our platform called mainstream network. as i noted at the time, in the event that facebook receives a request for personal data from an entity which can legally require such information, facebook will provide information in line with normal procedures. you will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to provide personal data of our users to any third party absent a lawful basis for such disclosure,” writes allan. he goes on to say that facebook has provided “information” about mainstream network to the uk’s data watchdog “on a private and confidential basis”. the ico is investigating the advertiser as part of a wider probe into the use of social media for political campaigning. “it is now a matter for ico (acting in accordance with its statutory duties) to determine what they will do with the data provided to them,” allan adds. we reached out to the ico to ask whether it intends to disclose the names. “we received a response from facebook to an information notice issued by the ico. the information is under review and forms part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes,” a spokeswoman told us. last summer information commissioner elizabeth denham called for an ethical pause of the use of social media tools for political ads — saying she was concerned about the lack of transparency and the knock-on impact that could have on democracy. in recent years facebook has been busy making loud crisis pr noises about how it’s ‘increasing the transparency’ around advertisers on its platform — ever since the 2016 us presidential election disinformation scandal blew up, and it emerged quite how many roubles facebook had been accepting to allow divisive kremlin ads to target us voters. the company launched ‘political ad transparency’ measures in the u.s. initially, including a requirement for election advertisers to verify they are us-based. it has also since rolled out some similar measures in some international markets — including in the u.k. where it introduced a system for disclosing political ads last fall. (though it quickly had to rework the system after it was shown being trivially easy to spoof.) allan appears to intend to reference the latter measures in the concluding portion of his letter, albeit he gets the date wrong by a full year. “i further note that as of 29 november 2019 [sic], we have required political advertisers to consent to the publication of additional information in the form of a disclaimer that they create when they go through the authorisation process. all political advertisements along with these disclaimers are made available to the public in our ad library,” he writes, without making it clear why that should mean facebook can’t disclose the identities behind mainstream network. the company has claimed to be working towards having a “global system” for political ad transparency. but the reality on the ground remains highly variable, piecemeal and very far from perfect full transparency. nor will facebook even come clean with the public when specifically asked to do so by policymakers, as its refusal to the dcms shows. responding to the company’s letter in a series of tweets, collins writes: “i believe there is a strong public interest in understanding who is behind the mainstream network, and that this information should be published. people have a right to know how is targeting them with political advertisements and why.” 2/3 i believe there is a strong public interest in understanding who is behind the mainstream network, and that this information should be published. people should have a right to know who is targeting them with political advertisements and why. — damian collins (@damiancollins) march 5, 2019 it remains to be seen whether the ico will release the information facebook has provided it. the watchdog has also so far declined to disclose the identities of several senior facebook executives who knew about another political ad scandal — the cambridge analytica data breach — earlier than the company had publicly claimed it knew. the dcms committee published its final report into online disinformation last month, setting out a laundry list of recommendations for cleaning up political campaigning in the digital era. the report also includes the tidbit about the trio of senior facebook managers who knew about the cambridge analytica breach sooner than zuckerberg himself (but apparently did not think to share the incident with the ceo), as well as singling out facebook for “disingenuous” and “bad faith” responses to democratic concerns about the misuse of people’s data. the committee’s report also calls for privacy and antitrust regulators to investigate the company."
