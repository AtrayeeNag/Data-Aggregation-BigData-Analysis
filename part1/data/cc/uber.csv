"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. what a week. it had looked a bit quiet with just a few big rounds to cover. i was looking forward to a relaxed episode, frankly. but no, as kate and i were prepping the show notes, the news gods opened the heavens and dropped a fifty-weight of mana right on our heads. it was a lot of news. in quick order, here’s what we tried to run through while keeping it brief: pinterest has filed to go public, albeit privately. at long last, pinterest’s ipo is underway. the social company is gunning for liquidity this year, could go public in june and is not targeting a down ipo. it’s looking like $12 billion and up for big pint. lyft’s ipo is racing along. lyft filed to go public back in december, dropping private filings neck-and-neck with uber. the two ride-hailing companies are both slated to get out this year, but it seems that lyft is going to lead the way. even more, it’s tipped to get out at a $20 billion to $25 billion valuation. as grounding, here’s the best math i could come up with concerning those numbers. doordash gets $400 million more. the rumored doordash round has landed, though it’s shaped a bit differently than we expected. doordash did not raise $500 million at a $6 billion valuation, it instead picked up $100 million less, but at a stronger $7.1 billion valuation. and, of course, the vision fund was involved. more vision fund largesse lands on clutter and flexport. what’s a week with just one vision fund round? a waste, of course. so, here are two more. clutter picked up $200 million while flexport raised a much more impressive $1 billion. clutter has now raised around $300 million while flexport’s capital sheet is flush now to the tune of $1.3 billion. as we touched on during the show, the two companies are now going to have more money to use than they have ever had before; let’s hope that that goes well. speaking of which, what about those valuations? two quick things to wrap up here. first, discontent among vision fund investors. the vision fund’s lps (the sources of its capital) aren’t perfectly happy with some of its choices. that, and what happened to people not taking blood money? we asked that again, probably shouting into the wind while we do so. as it turns out, silicon valley capitalism isn’t a new man; it’s just the same old capitalism in a sweater vest. all that and it was good to be back. chat you all in a week’s time! equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."
"welcome back to transportation weekly; i’m your host kirsten korosec, senior transportation reporter at techcrunch. this is the second edition and seriously people, what happened this week? too much. too much! never heard of techcrunch’s transportation weekly? catch up here. as i’ve written before, consider this a soft launch. follow me on twitter @kirstenkorosec to ensure you see it each week. (an email subscription is coming). off we go … vroom. onm … there are oems in the automotive world. and here, (wait for it) there are onms — original news manufacturers. (cymbal clash!) this is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation lives. this week, we’ve got some insider info on didi, china’s largest ride-hailing firm. china-based techcrunch reporter rita liao learned from sources that didi plans to lay off 15 percent of its employees, or about 2,000 people this year. ceo cheng wei made the announcement during an internal meeting friday morning. read about it here. didi’s troubles with regulators and its backlash from two high-profile passenger murders last year don’t exist in a vacuum. their struggles are in line with what is happening in the ride-hailing industry, particularly in more mature markets where the novelty has worn off and cities have woken up. for companies like didi, uber, lyft and other emerging players, this means more resources (capital and people) spent working with cities as well as looking for ways to diversify their businesses. all the while, they must still plug away at the nagging problems of reducing costs and keeping drivers and riders. just look at uber. as megan rose dickey reports, uber’s stiff losses continued in the fourth quarter. the upshot: its losses can be attributed to increased competition and significant investment in bigger bets like micro mobility and elevate. and apparently legal fees. uber, the verge reports, sued nyc on friday to overturn a law that caps drivers. dig in this week, techcrunch editor devin coldewey digs into the development of a system that can estimate not just where a pedestrian is headed, but their pose and gait too. the university of michigan, well known for its efforts in self-driving car tech, has been working on an improved algorithm for predicting the movements of pedestrians. these algorithms can be as simple as identifying a human and seeing how many pixels move over a few frames, then extrapolating from there. but naturally, human movement is a bit more complex than that. few companies advertise the exact level of detail with which they resolve human shapes and movement. this level of granularity seems beyond what we’ve seen. um’s new system uses lidar and stereo camera systems to estimate not just the trajectory of a person, but their pose and gait. pose can indicate whether a person is looking towards or away from the car, or using a cane, or stooped over a phone; gait indicates speed and intention. is someone glancing over their shoulder? maybe they’re going to turn around, or walk into traffic. this additional data helps a system predict motion and makes for a more complete set of navigation plans and contingencies. importantly, it performs well with only a handful of frames to work with — perhaps comprising a single step and swing of the arm. that’s enough to make a prediction that beats simpler models handily, a critical measure of performance as one cannot assume that a pedestrian will be visible for any more than a few frames between obstructions. not too much can be done with this noisy, little-studied data right now, but perceiving and cataloguing it is the first step to making it an integral part of an av’s vision system. — devin coldewey a little bird … we hear a lot. but we’re not selfish. let’s share. every big funding round has an origin story — that magic moment when planets align and a capitally-flush investor gazes across a room at just the right time and spots the perfect company in need of funds and guidance. one of this week’s biggest deals — see below — was the $940 million that softbank vision fund invested in autonomous delivery robot nuro. how (and when) nuro met softbank is almost as big a story as the funding round itself. ok, well maybe not as big. but interesting, nonetheless. it turns out that cruise, the self-driving unit of gm, was in early talks with nuro, but the parties couldn’t quite meet in the middle, people familiar with the deal told me. sources wouldn’t elaborate whether cruise was seeking to acquire nuro or take a minority stake in the company. it all worked out in the end, though. the folks at cruise introduced nuro to softbank. that means cruise and nuro now share the same investor. softbank agreed in may 2018 to invest $2.25 billion in gm cruise holdings llc. got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation? email me or send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec. deal(s) of the week we have a tie this week, which began with news that softbank’s vision fund invested in autonomous delivery robot nuro. the week closed with electric automaker rivian announcing a $700 million funding round led by amazon. first nuro. michael ronen, managing partner at softbank investment advisers, and the same person who was a big part of its investment in cruise, told techcrunch that the winners in this market will need to address a diverse mix of technological questions. in his view, that’s nuro. “nuro has built a team of brilliant problem solvers whose combined backgrounds in robotics, machine learning, autonomous driving and consumer electronics give them a compelling advantage,” ronen said. amazon’s investment in rivian is important, particularly when you step back and take a more holistic and historic view. consider this: the logistics giant stealthily acquired an urban delivery robot startup called dispatch in 2017 (a discovery mark harris made and reported for us last week). amazon showed off the fruit of that acquisition — its own delivery robot scout — in january 2018. last week, self-driving vehicle startup aurora raised more than $530 million in a series b funding round led by sequoia and with “significant” investments from amazon and t. rowe price. now, amazon is backing rivian. based on the deals that we know about, amazon’s hands are now deep into autonomous delivery, self-driving vehicle software and electric vehicles. let that sink in. other deals that got our attention this week: autonomous truck startup tusimple hits unicorn status in latest round av shuttle company may mobility raises $22 million: we talked to may’s alisyn malek (watch for this) c2a raises $6.2 million for its in-car cybersecurity platform audio tech supplier to rolls royce and xiaomi secures another $13.2 million belimobilgue raises $10m for its used-car sales platform in indonesia witricity acquired some ip assets from qualcomm that gives the company more than 1,500 patents and patent applications related to wireless charging. qualcomm inc. is now a minority witricity shareholder. snapshot sure, techcrunch focuses on startups. why auto loans? because auto loan data can be one of the canaries in the coal mine that is the automotive industry and on a larger scale, the economy.  and, delinquency rates ripple through the rest of the transportation world, affecting public transit and ride-hailing too. the new york federal reserve this week released a collection of economic data, including auto loans, which have been climbing since 2011. auto loans increased by $9 billion this year, a figure boosted by historically strong levels of newly originated loans that will put 2018 in the record books. there were $584 billion in new auto loans and leases appearing on credit reports in 2018, the highest level in the 19-year history of the loan origination data. why i’m watching this? because according to the quarterly report on household debt and credit: the flow into 90+ day delinquency for auto loan balances has been slowly trending upward since 2012 serious delinquency of auto loans held by borrowers under 30 years old between 2014 and 2016 rose (see chart) rising overall delinquency rates remain below 2010 peak levels. however, there were more than 7 million americans with auto loans that were 90 or more days delinquent at the end of 2018 tiny but mighty micro mobility it was a bit quiet on the micro-mobility front this week, but here’s what jumped out. unsurprisingly, san francisco denied lime’s appeal to operate electric scooters in the city. this is the same decision the city landed on pertaining to both uber’s jump and ford’s spin appeals. on the bright side for these companies, there may be hope for them to deploy scooters during phase two of the city’s pilot program, which starts in april. also in the sf bay area, lyft donated $700,000 to transform, an organization focused on improving access to transportation in underserved areas throughout california. in partnership with oakland mayor libby schaaf, lyft and transform will invest in a free bike library and community “parklets” in oakland, calif. meanwhile, over in tel aviv, lime deployed its electric scooters, joining electric scooter startup bird. lime also reportedly plans to deploy its scooters throughout the country of israel. next up will be cities in the gush dan region. in case you thought e-scooters were a new thing, here's a lady riding one in 1916. timing is everything.https://t.co/bb6ntmthtc pic.twitter.com/uyzikapbk3 — david e. weekly 🚁 (@dweekly) february 15, 2019 also in micro mobility … we read corporate updates to terms of service in our spare time. and this week, skip sent out an update that included an interesting nugget. it reads: we’ve updated specific provisions on camera footage. we’ve updated and made more clear that our scooters may be equipped with video camera equipment which we may use to help ensure that our scooters are used properly and in accordance with laws, rules, regulations and policies, to protect against crimes such as theft and vandalism, to help us determine if scooters are being used properly at speeds, locations and on surfaces that are proper and allowed as well as to improve our services. in december, skip unveiled two new scooters — one with a rear-facing camera. the company tested 200 of these scooter in washington, d.c. (and later rolled out to san francisco) to monitor whether people were riding on the sidewalk and generally riding safely. at the time, skip said it wasn’t sure what it would do with the data collected from the cameras. in other words, skip’s cameras are on. how they intend to use that data — whether via a warning to the rider, a message after the ride is complete, or remotely slowing the scooter down, isn’t clear. one startup that is poised to capture this new market of scooter accountability is fantasmo. the augmented reality mapping startup has a new scooter positioning camera that captures video and then matches that against a map to reliably identify how the scooter is being used. fantasmo’s camera system is not being used by skip. notable reads if you’re waiting for the big autonomous vehicle disengagement hot take story from me, you’ll be waiting for awhile. let me explain. this week, the california department of motor vehicles released the “disengagement reports” of autonomous vehicle companies with permits to test on public roads in the state. these reports are meant to track each time a self-driving vehicle disengages out of autonomous mode. there are 48 companies that issued reports, which when you combine all the data, drove more than 2 million miles on public roads in autonomous mode between december 2017 and november 2018. that’s a four-fold increase from the year before. companies that receive av testing permits in california, which are issued by the dmv, are required to submit these annually. it’s not that these reports are worthless. they are useful to determine if a company is ramping up its testing on public roads, adding more avs to its fleet, helpful for spotting trends like ‘why did disengagements suddenly end?’ or to determine if a company is even testing anymore. and i’ve discovered some interesting information that will become bigger stories or end up as footnotes in the world of avs. (for instance, faraday future says it will begin testing on public roads late this year). but disengagement reports are not a meaningful way to make comparisons on how companies stack up against each other. why? because it’s not an “apples-to-apples” comparison for one, companies report the data in different ways and there is no transparency into the specifics of when and where each disengagement occurred. another problem is the miles-per-disengagement figure that we (the media) typically focus on. this data isn’t super useful on its own. this shouldn’t be treated like a report card. as one engineer told me once, you learn only from occasions in which the system does, or wants to do, something different from a good human. the smart av companies will take the disengagement data and combine it with other information taken from simulation and other forms of offline testing. the “miles per disengagement” data point doesn’t start to mean anything on its own until a company reaches the validation phase, which is when miles driven are the truest representation of naturalistic driving in the domain and application of interest. how many are at this point? i’m hearing one or two. testing and deployments much of the talk and marketing materials around flying cars, or evtols, focuses on well-dressed business folks standing on top of skyscrapers, preparing to be whisked away — up and over the terrible traffic below. other startups have focused on last-mile delivery. but what about long-distance cargo delivery to remote and urban areas? elroy air is one company that is working on this problem. the san francisco-based startup has been developing an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing cargo transport system that can operate outside of airport infrastructure and carry up to 500 pounds of cargo over 300 miles. elroy air just closed a $9.2 million round that included investors catapult ventures, levitate capital, lemnos, precursor ventures, haystack, shasta ventures, homebrew, 122west, amplify partners, hemisphere ventures, the e14 fund and diamondstream partners. the company said this week it will begin testing its unmanned vertical-takeoff-and-landing drone for commercial deliveries — called the chaparral — this year and launch a commercial shipping service  in 2020. these vehicles will be monitored by trained operators at all times during the testing phase, the company said. on our radar let’s not forget that people are using buses and trains everyday. not in a year. not in 10. right now. these transit systems, many of which need expensive upgrades, carry millions of people every day. one of the more interesting examples of the challenges with transit is the l train shutdown in new york. the metropolitan transportation authority needs to repair a subway tunnel under the east river and initially had planned to shut down the entire tunnel for 15 months, starting in late april. the l train carries 275,000 people between bedford avenue in brooklyn and eighth avenue in manhattan, the effected section, every day. new york gov. andrew cuomo intervened and now there’s a new plan, which involves running trains through one tunnel tube while repairs are carried out in the other tube. the nyt has the back story. there’s an upcoming “l train shutdown” event this month in brooklyn that we’re keeping an eye on. urban-x, the startup accelerator backed by automotive brand mini, is hosting a discussion on the future of the l-train and alternative modes of transport. some interesting folks will be participating, including lime’s chief program officer scott kubly. the event will be held 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm, feb. 19 at a/d/o, 29 norman ave, brooklyn, ny. thanks for reading. there might be content you like or something you hate. feel free to reach out to me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share those thoughts, opinions or tips.  nos vemos la próxima vez."
"david mayman has a vision for personal aviation that he’s spent the past dozen years and millions of his personal fortune chasing. he hasn’t accepted the convention that jetpacks were just a misguided fantasy for the future; his company, jetpack aviation, has been building them and he’s been zooming around in publicity-grabbing stunts in a plea to the public that there’s room to dream when it comes to human flight. and while an eight-person startup aiming to build out a fleet of $380,000 “flying motorcycles” might seem like a tall order, y combinator, a top accelerator known for its occasionally bizarre bets, is gambling on the company and its jet engine-obsessed ceo in one of its latest investments. jetpack aviation is about to become a very different company. the startup has launched pre-orders this week for the moonshot of moonshots, the speeder, a personal vertical take-off and landing vehicle with a svelte concept design that looks straight out of star wars or halo. deep-pocketed, sci-fi-minded buyers are going to have to fork over $10,000 just to get a spot in the pre-order line for the first vehicles to ship, but the startup’s founder seems to see the campaign as less about the money than it is about the confirmation that there are people interested in planting a stake in his wild company’s future success. “i think it’s a validation statement for all of us,” mayman tells techcrunch. “if you look at how long tesla took to deliver the model 3 to customers, i think people understand that this is not something that’s a kickstarted pre-delivery campaign where at the tail-end of it we’re immediately going to be delivering product.” there are gambles and then there are flying motorcycles. this is frankly an atypical startup for yc to fund, but it is also an unconventional business path for mayman, who has largely been self-financing his jetpack-building obsession for the past 12 years. for the australian ceo, the yc investment is mainly about gaining access to silicon valley’s network of vcs, though he also acknowledges it’s a fair assumption that sf breeds the type of executive that might be interested in pre-ordering something so seemingly outlandish.  “i can’t imagine someone not being excited about a flying motorcycle,” yc partner jared friedman told techcrunch in an email. “jetpack aviation created the future with speeder, and i look forward to seeing how this technology transforms the dreaded commute, vacation travel, and everyday errands.” while much of the excitement mayman has raised for his company’s jetpacks has relied on the spectacle of prototype demos in front of throngs of news networks (jetpack aviation has unsurprisingly partnered with red bull), the company has yet to build a full-scale prototype of the speeder, though he says their new round of funding should get them there. mayman flying a jetpack around the statue of liberty in 2015 can they actually build this? that’s seems to be a pretty valid question. in our conversation, mayman acknowledges upfront that: the speeder is “at least” two years of development time away from ending up in customer hands. the company will have to raise “tens of millions” of dollars to ship this design. there are still plenty of unknowns. jetpack aviation’s current design is more ambitious than most helicopter-shaped concept vtol vehicles being pursued by companies like uber, namely due to its relatively sleek design where the human rider is directly above a set of several gimbal-mounted jet engines. the company claims finished designs will move faster than 150 mph at altitudes up to 15,000 feet. the flight time is still a limiting factor; max flight times for the models are estimated to be around 30 minutes. the company is planning a number of versions, including an ultralight model that complies with some federal regulations and won’t require a pilot’s license, the company says. the startup’s most pertinent problem is creating the autonomous stabilization technologies that will make flying the speeder effortless and safe. mayman notes that most vtol designs look like quadcopters simply because the physics of putting weight directly on top of the thrust system is so challenging. “it’s like trying to balance a pencil on your finger,” he says. his team has been training people to use their jetpacks — now in their 11th design iteration — and say it takes about a week to get potential flyers up-and-running with the particulars of the system. but mayman says he wants this to be a device that just works, a design concept that made a lot of sense when steve jobs was using it to refer to the simplicity of the ipad, but feels a tad more aggressive when presented with the rendered images of someone flying this thing over city centers: a lot of the industry’s existing work around autonomous flight and stabilization for drone aircraft really doesn’t account for jetpack aviation’s design, though mayman says they’ve already made some significant progress with their 1:3 scale prototype. he also notes that the company does have a “less elegant-looking” plan-b design if they determine the centrally clustered jet engines are too much of a stabilization liability. indeed, the key for getting a concept like this off the ground and ensuring the company doesn’t miserably fail is being flexible about how this vision matures, mayman says, noting that they’re approaching the vehicle with multiple designs and multiple considerations for how the regulatory environment for certification shapes up, including work on a separate military version and consideration for designs more focused on emergency response like rapid medical evacuation. asked whether pre-orderers plunking down $10k might be disappointed by a different-looking product, the founder said that they’ve done enough modeling to know that what they build will fall into a roughly similar design. “it may not look exactly like what we’ve rendered, but i’m confident that it’s still going to be the same sort of concept, a motorcycle or jet-ski size and shape.” it is certainly a unique choice for the company to launch its pre-orders already with so much in the air, but it’s fairly apparent that they are looking to emulate tesla here, and if people with nearly $400k to throw around want to buy a jet-engine jet-ski, then by all means, let the free market do its thing. y combinator’s $150,000 investment is an early step for the moonshot effort and a vote of confidence that places them on others’ radar. mayman, for his part, does seem genuinely thrilled about expanding the ambitions of his passion project, even if the road ahead is crowded with obstacles for realizing the vision. “if you don’t start it, you’re never going to get there,” mayman says. “if our guys weren’t able to wake up every morning saying, ‘holy shit, this would be freaking amazing if we can build this,’ then it’s sort of not worth doing. we might as well go do something else.”"
"uber freight, which helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies, has made two high-profile hires this month as it continues to scale up its app and plans for a global expansion. the company has hired andrew smith, one of box’s early employees, to head up global sales at uber freight, and bar ifrach, formerly of airbnb, to lead its marketplace team, techcrunch has learned. smith had a 10-year run at box, where he was most recently vice president of field and commercial sales for north america. ifrach has moved up the ranks at airbnb during his 5-year tenure, starting as a data scientist and eventually becoming director of data science for airbnb homes. ifrach oversaw the data science development of airbnb marketplace features such as matching, instant book, pricing, and monetization. the pair started at uber freight this month, techcrunch has learned. both report directly to lior ron, who returned last summer. ron was one of the co-founders of autonomous trucking company otto, which uber acquired in 2016. he left the company following waymo’s trade secrets lawsuit against uber. as head of marketplace, ifrach is going to build out and improve the app’s pricing infrastructure as well as how it matches drivers and loads, uber freight confirmed. meanwhile, smith will be focused on building out the company’s sales team and shaping its go-to-market strategy. uber freight, which spun out of uber to become its own business unit in 2018, has offices in san francisco and chicago. the company has been scaling up its business since launching in may 2017, growing from limited regional operations in texas to the rest of the continental united states. uber freight has bigger expansion plans for 2019. the company plans to more than double its staff this year and is eyeing international markets. the company doesn’t disclose employee numbers. however, insiders target the number at “hundreds.” uber freight already has a dedicated team looking into international markets, the company confirmed. uber freight has been building out features in its app as it expands to other markets and tries to lure more users. for example, the company recently added a facility ratings feature that allows drivers to rate facilities on a scale of 1 to 5. there’s also an option to leave a written review. the facilities rating aims to help drivers decide whether to book a load. these amenities – stuff like parking, bathrooms, and load wait time, are more critical than outsiders might realize. a survey of 150 trucking companies in 2018 found that 80 percent of carrier respondents refused to take loads from facilities for reasons that included inflexible appointment hours and lengthy detention times. the u.s. department of transportation estimates detention times cost truckers a total of $1.1 to $1.3 billion in earnings each year."
"taxify, the ride-hailing company from estonia backed by didi and daimler and now active in 30 countries, is making a key shift in its business today as it gears up for its next stage of growth. the company is removing “taxi” from its name and rebranding as bolt, the same name that it has been using for its new electric scooter service, to double down on providing multiple transportation options beyond private cars. the shift in name and vision comes as the company has started talks for another round of funding, techcrunch has learned. bolt last raised money in may 2018, when it closed a $175 million round at a $1 billion valuation led by daimler. ceo and co-founder markus villig confirmed in an interview in london this week that the next big growth round will be coming in at a higher price tag — he referred to the $1 billion post-money valuation from the last round as a “good start” — in part because bolt has expanded quite a bit in the interim: it had 10 million users in 25 countries back then; now, it has 25 million users in 30 countries across europe, africa and other territories. the rebrand from taxify to bolt is serving a few purposes, villig said. tapping the basic meanings of “bolt,” the new name implies speed, as well as electricity. “we are bullish that the future is fully electric and so we wanted a name that moved us away from the combustion engine,” he said. putting future engine technology to one side, the move away from using “taxi” in the name also underscores how the startup intends to widen its remit to cover more than just car-based rides. cars may make up the vast majority of bolt’s service today, but the plan is to add more scooters, other individual transport modes and soon public transport links, he said, not unlike citymapper’s multi-modal approach. “the old name was too restrictive.” bolt’s growth — villig describes it as the solid number-two in the european ride-hailing market after uber in terms of rides and revenues — has not been without its bumps. key among those challenges is that the company has yet to launch a full service in the u.k., and specifically london, the biggest ride-hailing market in europe. its efforts to come to london stretch back to 2017, during what was probably the height of tension between its chief rival uber and london regulators. tired of waiting for its operating license to get approved, taxify tried to circumvent the process by buying a small firm that already had one and launched services that way. but the regulators were in no mood for funny business: after a mere three days of service, it got shut down. since then, taxify (and now bolt) has been quietly, and patiently, working on getting a license and approval to operate on its own steam. “we hope to get going in the next couple of months in london,” villig said. that could, confusingly, involve yet another brand. at the end of last year, taxify rebranded its london app as “hopp” and started to accept driver sign-ups, but no passengers. it’s not clear whether hopp will also now rebrand as bolt, or how it will get used, but at the moment i’m seeing hopp branding across several areas of the new bolt site. while london — and other tense markets for ridesharing startups like spain and germany — have all remained elusive, bolt has used its home base of estonia to edge into a number of other territories where rules have been less stringent and competition less fierce, including “most of the central and eastern european markets.” sweden is the next country on its launch list, he added. driving to the beat of a different drum to the ordinary passenger or driver, bolt might look a lot like many other ride-hailing apps you might know, such as uber, but behind the scenes, the two have taken very different tracks when it comes to launching and growing services. while uber has pursued a strategy of global domination and (over the years) spending and launching aggressively to gain first-mover advantage in a number of markets, bolt has done nearly the opposite. villig — a 25-year-old who built the first taxify app with his brother martin when he was only 19 (he dropped out of university after six months to build the business) — is a firm believer in the fact that being a late entrant can be to a company’s advantage. “uber has burned most of its bridges in europe by barging into cities and running as long as they could before getting shut down, and now it needs to recover from that.” bridges are not the only thing that uber has burned. villig believes that being a later entrant has also meant that bolt has spent significantly less to educate the market and pick up new customers and drivers for its own private ride-hailing services. and when it comes to r&d, the company is investing in this — but it’s mainly coming in the form of hiring engineers to improve and expand its mapping and routing instructions for drivers and passengers that have a choice of using multiple services, rather than more costly efforts in areas like self-driving cars. as a point of comparison, uber has reportedly spent at least $2 billion on its own self-driving car efforts. “self-driving is completely overhyped,” villig said dismissively of how a number of its rivals and would-be rivals are pursuing a strategy to build and therefore “own” autonomous car technology. “it will take at least another five years for anything to come out, and it’s clear that there will be a number of players who will be making self-driving technology, so our plan is to partner with them.” he added that bolt is “doing more than $1 billion (gross) in annual rides, which is more than five times the money we have raised. no one comes close to that, and we’re aiming to keep up that efficiency,” he said. “right now, investors appreciate that there is a ride-hailing company out there that is not burning $1 billion per year.” bolt has raised around $185 million in total, with backers in addition to daimler including china’s didi, transferwise’s taavet hinrikus, korelya capital and others. given that bolt has two key strategic investors in the form of daimler and didi — both of whom have been making investments and acquisitions to consolidate their positions in the area of on-demand transportation — i asked villig if he thought either might potentially try to acquire bolt as part of their own expansion plans. didi, he said, has largely been a hands-off investor that was more involved when the company was younger but now is letting bolt follow its own course in local markets. “the industry is at the stage now where every market is unique, and you can’t simply transfer knowledge from one to the other. that means less cooperation with didi,” he said. daimler, meanwhile, has amassed a huge number of “mobility” holdings, which last month grew even more when it combined its mobility efforts with bmw’s in a $1.1 billion deal. villig acknowledged there have been multiple acquisition proposals in recent years, but nothing that he would want to entertain seriously for now. still, he also likened europe to the u.s. as a market where realistically there will only be two strong players — just as there is lyft and uber in the u.s. that means ultimately someone will have to take the lead on consolidation, even if it doesn’t happen immediately. “many still the believe that ride hailing is a winner-take-all model, but now it’s clear that’s not the case. every geography will have one or two winners. that’s been the big shift.”"
"walmart this morning posted strong holiday sales growth for its holiday quarter, with u.s. sales up 4.2 percent over the same time last year, and a 43 percent rise in walmart’s u.s. e-commerce sales. the retailer topped analyst expectations, with $138.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, just ahead of the forecasted $138.76 billion; and earnings per share of $1.41, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.33. most notably, walmart attributed the strong e-commerce growth to the expansion of its grocery pickup and delivery businesses, and a broader assortment on walmart.com. the company has been challenging amazon, instacart, target’s shipt and others on grocery. it had toyed with the idea for years, before figuring out a model that made sense and didn’t lose money. with grocery pickup, walmart offers an alternative to the higher cost of using grocery delivery services, while still allowing for convenience, as its customers can skip shopping the aisles and instead remain in their cars while groceries are loaded into the trunk. more recently, the company began working with a network of partners to offer grocery delivery to customers’ homes. it has ended relationships with uber, lyft and deliv while adding new partners like point pickup, skipcart, axlehire and roadie, and shifting business to partners like postmates and doordash. today, walmart’s grocery pickup service is available at more than 2,100 walmart locations and delivery is offered at nearly 800. it expects to offer pickup at 3,100 locations and delivery at 1,600 locations by the end of fiscal year 2020, it says. meanwhile, walmart has been working to expand its assortment online and offer more types of shopping experiences. for example, in fiscal year 2018, the retailer launched the high-end lord & taylor shop on the site; added 3d virtual shopping in its home category; launched a sports fan-focused fanatics shop; introduced a new nursery destination on walmart.com; began adding merchandise from its acquired brands to the main website; and launched walmart ebooks in partnership with kobo; among other things. walmart has also made shipping to your home more affordable. in 2017, walmart introduced an alternative to amazon’s pricier prime membership with free, two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. this past year, it expanded free, two-day shipping to its marketplace items by working with hundreds of its top sellers and third-party fulfillment providers, like deliverr. the company last year also launched a new, more personalized website, which included a revamped home section, as well as a cleaner, more modern design and sections that showcased items trending in the shoppers’ local area. the redesigned website made it easier to order groceries and reorder favorites, too. in november, emarketer noted walmart had overtaken apple to become the no. 3 online retailer in the u.s., with walmart (including its jet and sam’s club brands) poised to capture 4 percent of all online retail by year-end. amazon, of course, remained no. 1, followed by ebay. “progress on initiatives to accelerate growth, along with a favorable economic environment, helped us deliver strong comp sales and gain market share,” said walmart ceo doug mcmillon, in a statement. “we’re excited about the work we’re doing to reach customers in a more digitally-connected way. our commitment to the customer is clear – we’ll be there when, where and how they want to shop and deliver new, convenient experiences that are uniquely walmart.”"
"uber filed a lawsuit against new york city, the verge reported. the company wants to overturn new york city’s rule that caps the number of new ride-hailing drivers. last summer, the city approved legislation that halts the issuing of new licenses to drivers for 12 months. it has been a multi-year fight between uber and new york city. nyc mayor bill de blasio has been in favor of new legislation to regulate ride-hailing companies for years. and the nyc council finally voted in favor of such a new rule back in august 2018. uber has had a strong stance against the new regulatory framework. before the vote, the company even called loyal customers to ask them to call local council members and support uber. there are a few reasons why policymakers have been in favor of the halt. first, taxi medallion holders have been suffering from the sudden market changes caused by uber, lyft and other ride-hailing companies. the value of their licenses have dropped significanyly, which created some financial issues for drivers who got a credit to acquire those licenses. second, ride-hailing services have fostered congestion across the city. it seems a bit counterintuitive as some uber users have given up on their personal cars to switch to uber. but uber also replaces a lot of other transportation methods, such as subways, buses, bikes, etc. in addition to that usage pattern switch, many drivers are still driving around new york city, waiting for the next ride. those idle cars clog the streets. third, there are also economical reasons for this change. uber is a marketplace that matches drivers with riders. the company is leveraging the fact that rules aren’t as strict for ride-hailing drivers as for taxi drivers. this way, uber can accept a ton of drivers even though demand doesn’t necessarily match. uber can then leverage this market imbalance to drive down wages. as part of the vote, new york city has also agreed on a minimum wage for ride-hailing drivers. eventually, it could lead to an increase in price for customers. but so many customers have turned their back on public transportation that it is now generating too many issues when it comes to infrastructure investments and traffic congesting. it’s a chicken-and-egg situation. you can’t expect a better subway system if nobody is interested in taking the subway anymore. and you can’t expect customers to rely on the subway if there hasn’t been enough investment to make it reliable."
"competition is the core of capitalism. competition between companies lowers prices — on average — and ensures that they are forced to innovate lest they lose their markets to others. competition between workers ensures that people strive to do their best work lest their jobs go to more qualified or faster or cheaper replacements. obviously, there is a spectrum here from lethargic monopoly to cutthroat competition that causes more problems than it’s worth (environmental damage in the hopes of cutting costs, fraud, deceit, etc.). drawing that line though is really, really hard though, and there are unfortunately not many non-academic discussions of how much competition is needed to spur innovation. so it was surprising to read an entire chapter about this dilemma comparing china and the u.s. in kai-fu lee’s book ai superpowers (yes, yes, i am dreadfully behind on this particular book review). while the book is about ai, lee is trying to undo american conceptions of chinese innovation early on in the text. yes, the country was once a copycat haven, but that has changed as the learnings of copying have led to originality: the first act of copying didn’t turn into an anti-innovation mentality that its creator could never shake. it was a necessary steppingstone on the way to more original and locally tailored technology products. in his narrative, american (tech) companies didn’t fail in china because they were incompetent, but rather because they never made the effort to localize: american public companies tend to treat international markets as cash cows, sources of bonus revenue to which they are entitled by virtue of winning at home. […] american companies treat china like just any other market to check off their global list. they don’t invest the resources, have the patience, or give their chinese teams the flexibility needed to compete with china’s world-class entrepreneurs. china’s entrepreneurs didn’t just learn how to build products quickly from their early copying, but also learned that they had to ferociously compete for markets: the sheer density of competition and willingness to drive prices down to zero forced companies to iterate: to tweak their products and invent new monetization models, building robust businesses with high walls that their copycat competitors couldn’t scale. lee’s ultimate point is that by focusing on markets instead of mission, chinese startups move far faster and more aggressively to seize opportunities. but that also means that there are can be thousands of startups all targeting the same market at the same time, which forces outside-the-box (read: quite possibly unethical or illegal) behavior in order to compete. “for these gladiators, no dirty trick or underhanded maneuver was out of bounds. they deployed tactics that would make uber founder travis kalanick blush.” i’ve talked a number of times about the “chinese think palo alto is dumpy” problem. but it bears repeating: competition is the key to a startup ecosystem. competition forces founders to move faster, to hire quicker, to make product decision with alacrity and otherwise to win their markets today and not a year from now. the best founders in silicon valley founders understand this, although this secret seems to be increasingly lost today. history, of course repeats. just yesterday, it was revealed that chinese caffeine chain luckin coffee received a $200 million loan from investment banks in prep for an ipo. from julie zhu and kane wu at reuters: the firm officially launched its business only in january last year and in july raised $200 million in its maiden funding round that valued it at $1 billion, making it one of the fastest-ever firms to make the ‘unicorn’ milestone. […] the loss-making firm has been expanding at breakneck speed with over 2,000 cafes opened and plans to open 2,500 this year – displacing starbucks as china’s largest coffee chain in the process. 15 months and larger than starbucks. that’s speed, and that’s how you compete. digging into the s1: jumia ipo has points for praise and pause pius utomi ekpei/afp/getty images written by arman tabatabai jumia grabbed headlines yesterday after the african e-commerce player filed for an ipo on the nyse. our writer jake bright covered the news and provided insightful context around jumia’s business model, its footprint, and the state of e-commerce in africa. with jumia en route to becoming africa’s first public tech company listed abroad, we dug into the company’s s-1 to get a better understanding of all its moving parts. generally, the story is pretty compelling: jumia is one of the largest pan-africa e-commerce businesses with a large and rapidly growing active user base that is positively levered at africa’s economic development and mobile adoption. while the company is burning cash and losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year, that’s hardly uncommon anymore. but one area that gave me pause was the company’s margin breakdown. to measure the economics and operating performance of the company’s core operations, jumia uses “platform contribution,” a metric it defines as gross profit — excluding revenue from services outside the core platform — subtracted by fulfillment costs from third-party logistics providers, primarily related to freight and shipping. using this metric, jumia’s platform contribution was about 9-11% of sales in 2017-18. however, jumia’s metric excludes fulfillment and delivery costs associated with jumia’s network of warehouses, their fulfillment employees, and other related expenses, with the logic being that these costs are fairly flat year-to-year and less indicative of the variable costs of the business. however, as an e-commerce logistics and delivery provider, the unaccounted for fulfillment costs seem at least relevant, if not core. if we were to include all jumia’s fulfillment expenses in the calculation, jumia’s platform contribution would actually be negative 5-11% in 2017-18. while thin to negligible margins aren’t unusual for scaling e-commerce platforms, jumia’s margins fall short of levels seen in past prospectuses from some of the e-commerce giants jumia looks up to. amazon, alibaba, and even jd.com all had at least a year of positive margins including total fulfillment costs at the time of their s-1s. (though to be fair here, none of the three companies are apples-to-apples comps — amazon’s s-1 was decades ago, alibaba operated on a completely different scale at the time of its ipo, and jd.com used a different model focused on direct sales). still, the numbers here are just a little unnerving within the context of africa’s previous e-commerce failures, as discussed by jake bright: “jumia’s move to go public comes as several notable consumer digital sales startups have faltered in nigeria… …in late 2018, nigerian online sales platform dealdey shut down. and techcrunch reported this week that consumer-focused venture gloo.ng has dropped b2c e-commerce altogether to pivot to e-procurement. the ceo cited better unit economics from b2b sales. jumia also competes with services backed by amazon and naspers in several of its markets, which can be daunting when competing on economics. the other disclosure that had me harping on jumia’s fulfillment expense was in the “risk factors” section, where the company highlighted that it operates in markets with under-developed physical, economic, legal, and institutional infrastructure. and while there’s heavy investment going into african infrastructure — which could act as a growth tailwind for jumia in the long-run — improving, let alone creating, infrastructure takes much longer than doing the same in normal business operations, as we’ve discussed ad nauseam. because of the lack of infrastructure, jumia openly discusses the difficulties of delivery and stable fulfillment in its markets and has had to build out a lot of operational infrastructure itself. to me, it at least raises questions around how quickly jumia will be able to get its cost structure down and whether it might take a bit longer compared to some of its global e-commerce peers. thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people, and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york"
"if you haven’t been paying attention to tiktok, you haven’t been paying attention. the short-form video app hailing from beijing’s bytedance just had its biggest month ever with the addition of 75 million new users in december — a 275 percent increase from the 20 million it added in december 2017, according a recent report from sensor tower. despite its rapid rise, there are still plenty of people — often, older people — who aren’t quite sure what tiktok is. tiktok is often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, which makes it sound like it’s some online karaoke experience. but a closer comparison would be vine, twitter’s still sorely missed short-form video app whose content lives on as youtube compilations. while it’s true that tiktok is home to some standard lip-syncing, it’s actually better known for its act-out memes backed by music and other sound clips, which get endlessly reproduced and remixed among its young users. its tunes are varied — pop, rap, r&b, electro and dj tracks serve as backing for its 15-second video clips. but the sounds may also be snagged from youtube music videos (see: i baked you a pie above), soundcloud or from pop culture — like weird soundbites from peppa pig or riverdale — or just original creations. these memes-as-videos reference things familiar to gen z, like gaming culture (see below). they come in the form of standalone videos, reactions, duets, mirrors/clones and more. the app has been growing steadily since it acquired its u.s.-based rival musical.ly in november 2017 for north of $800 million, then merged the two apps’ user bases last august. this gave tiktok the means to grow in western markets, where it has attracted the interest of u.s. celebrities like jimmy fallon and tony hawk, for example, along with youtubers on the hunt for the next new thing. but unlike vine (rip), youtube or instagram, tiktok doesn’t yet feel dominated by micro-celebs, though they certainly exist. instead, its main feed often surfaces everyday users — aka, amateurs — doing something cute, funny or clever, with a tacit acknowledgement that “yes, this is an internet joke” underlying much of the content. okay, okay. sometimes these videos are described as “cringey.”  but that’s because those of us trying to talk about tiktok are old(er) people who grew up on the big ol’ mean internet. cringey, frankly, is an unfair label, as it dismisses tiktok’s success in setting a tone for its community. here, users will often post and share unapologetically wholesome content, and receive less mocking than elsewhere on the web — largely because everyone else on tiktok posts similar “cringey” content, too. you might not know this, however, if your only exposure to tiktok comes from youtube’s tiktok cringe compilations. but spend a day in the (oddly addictive) tiktok feed, and you’ll find a whole world of video that doesn’t exist anywhere else on the web — including on youtube. videos that are weird, sure — but also fun to watch. it’s a stark comparison to the existing social media platforms. users today are engaged in the culture wars on twitter (ban the nazis! protect free speech!), while youtubers are gaming the algorithm with hateful, exploitive, dangerous and otherwise questionable content that freaks out advertisers. and facebook is, well, contributing to war crimes and the toppling of democracy. meanwhile, tiktok often presents an alternative version of online sharing. simple, goofy, irreverent — and frankly, it’s a much needed reset. for example, some of the popular tiktok memes have included videos of kids proclaiming what a great mom they have, as they drag her into frame, or they remind people to pick up litter and conserve water. they might give themselves silly, but self-affirming makeovers where, afterwards, they cite themselves not as “cute” but rather “drop. dead. gorgeous.” they might spend hours setting up gummy bears as adele concert-goers, learning how to do a shuffle dance up a set of stairs or in a dance battle their dad. or they may showcase some special talent — drawing, painting, gymnastics, dance or skateboarding, perhaps. they do science experiments, make jokes or use special effects for a little video magic. they shout out “hit or miss!” in public places and wait to see who answers. (look it up.) sometimes it’s dumb, sometimes it’s clever. but it’s addictive. of course, it is still the internet. and tiktok isn’t perfect. the app has also been the subject of troubling reports about its “dark” side, which is reportedly filled with child predators, devious algorithms, dark patterns, and teens bullying and harassing one another. it’s not clear, however, that tiktok’s affliction with these matters is any worse than any other large, social, public-by-default app of its size. and unlike some apps, concerned parents — or the users themselves — can set a tiktok account to private, turn off commenting, hide the account from search, disable downloads, disallow reactions and duets and restrict an account from receiving messages. it is concerning, however, that under-13 kids are setting up social media accounts without parental consent. (but, uh, have you seen fortnite and roblox? this is what kids do. at least the tiktok main feed isn’t worrisome by default, we’ve found.) the bigger issue, though — and one that could ultimately prove damaging to tiktok — is whether it will be able to keep up with content filtering and takedown requests, or handle its security and privacy protection issues as it scales up. content and community aren’t the only things contributing to tiktok’s growth. while vine may have introduced the concept of short-form video, tiktok made video editing incredibly simple. you don’t need to be a video expert to put together clips with a range of effects. it’s the instagram for the mobile video age — in a way that instagram itself won’t be able to reproduce, having already aligned its community with influencers and advertisers. tiktok’s sizable user base, meanwhile, is due not only to its growth in western markets, but because of its traction in emerging markets like china and india. this allowed tiktok to rank no. 4 worldwide across ios and android, combined, according to app annie’s data on the most-downloaded apps of 2018. on ios, tiktok was the no. 1 most-downloaded app of the year, mainly thanks to china. at times last year, tiktok even ranked higher than facebook, instagram, snapchat and youtube. both app annie and sensor tower agree that tiktok scored the no. 3 position for most installs among all apps worldwide in 2018. now, tiktok is growing in india, says sensor tower. the country accounted for 27 percent of new installs between december 2017 and december 2018, and last month was the source for 32.3 million of tiktok’s 75 million total new downloads — a 25x increase from last year. some of this growth comes from ad spend, according to a report from apptopia, which examined the app’s widened use of ad networks. (it’s also driving people bonkers with its youtube ads, some of which are highly questionable.). the revenue is starting to arrive, as well. worldwide, users spent $6 million tipping their favorite live streamers, a 253 percent year-over-year jump from december 2017’s total of $1.7 million, sensor tower estimates. but live streaming is not the default activity on tiktok — it added the feature after shutting down musical.ly’s live streaming app, live.ly. above: full-screen ad in tiktok when app is first launched; spotted today think this is the first real ad campaign i’ve seen on @tiktok_us. @kerrymflynn pic.twitter.com/zt3jcsycz0 — chris harihar (@chrisharihar) january 26, 2019 above: an ad appearing earlier this month tiktok is also starting to test in-app advertising, and is being eyed by agencies as a result. when you launch tiktok, you may see a full-page splash screen ad of some kind — though the company has not officially launched ad products. but the brands are starting to take notice. this week, for example, tiktok collaborated with sportsmanias, an officially licensed nfl players association partner, for the introduction of nfl-themed ar animated stickers in time for the super bowl. the move feels like a test for how well branded content will perform within the tiktok universe, but the company says it’s “not an ad deal.” the company also declined to say how many are today using tiktok. however, parent company bytedance had publicly stated last year that it had 500 million monthly active users when it announced the app’s rebranding post-merger. it has yet to release new numbers for its global user base. that said, bytedance just shared updated stats for china only, on all versions of the tiktok app (including the non-google play android version). it says that tiktok now has 500 million monthly active users in china alone. sensor tower today estimates tiktok has grown to nearly 800 million lifetime installs, not counting android in china. factoring in those android in china installs, it’s fair to say this app has topped 1 billion downloads. here comes the new new internet, folks. it’s big, dominated by emerging markets, mobile, video, meme-ified, and goes viral both online and off. so if you haven’t been paying attention to tiktok, you may want to get started."
"the government shutdown entered its 21st day on friday, upping concerns of potentially long-lasting impacts on the u.s. stock market. private market investors around the country applauded when uber finally filed documents with the sec to go public. others were giddy to hear lyft, pinterest, postmates and slack (via a direct listing, according to the latest reports) were likely to ipo in 2019, too. unfortunately, floats that seemed imminent may not actually surface until the second half of 2019 — that is unless president donald trump and other political leaders are able to reach an agreement on the federal budget asap.  this week, we explored the government’s shutdown’s connection to tech ipos, recounted the demise of a well-funded ar project and introduced readers to an ai-enabled self-checkout shopping cart. 1. postmates gets pre-ipo cash the company, an early entrant to the billion-dollar food delivery wars, raised what will likely be its last round of private capital. the $100 million cash infusion was led by blackrock and valued postmates at $1.85 billion, up from the $1.2 billion valuation it garnered with its unicorn round in 2018. 2. uber’s ipo may not be as eye-popping as we expected to be fair, i don’t think many of us really believed the ride-hailing giant could debut with a $120 billion initial market cap. and can speculate on uber’s valuation for days (the latest reports estimate a $90 billion ipo), but ultimately wall street will determine just how high uber will fly. for now, all we can do is sit and wait for the company to relinquish its s-1 to the masses. 3. deal of the week n26, a german fintech startup, raised $300 million in a round led by insight venture partners at a $2.7 billion valuation. techcrunch’s romain dillet spoke with co-founder and ceo valentin stalf about the company’s global investors, financials and what the future holds for n26. 4. on the market bird is in the process of raising an additional $300 million on a flat pre-money valuation of $2 billion. the e-scooter startup has already raised a ton of capital in a very short time and a fresh financing would come at a time when many investors are losing faith in scooter startups’ claims to be the solution to the problem of last-mile transportation, as companies in the space display poor unit economics, faulty batteries and a general air of undependability. plus, aurora, the developer of a full-stack self-driving software system for automobile manufacturers, is raising at least $500 million in equity funding at more than a $2 billion valuation in a round expected to be led by new investor sequoia capital. here’s your weekly reminder to send me tips, suggestions and more to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or @kateclarktweets.  5. a unicorn’s deal downsizes wework, a co-working giant backed with billions, had planned on securing a $16 billion investment from existing backer softbank . well, that’s not exactly what happened. and, oh yeah, they rebranded. 6. a startup collapses after 20 long years, augmented reality glasses pioneer odg has been left with just a skeleton crew after acquisition deals from facebook and magic leap fell through. here’s a story of a startup with $58 million in venture capital backing that failed to deliver on its promises. 7. data point seed activity for u.s. startups has declined for the fourth straight year, as median deal sizes increased at every stage of venture capital. key takeaways: 1. seed activity for u.s. startups declined for the fourth straight year2. median u.s. seed deal was the highest on record in q4 at $2.1m3. seed activity as a % of deals shrunk to 25% 4. companies securing seed deals are older than ever https://t.co/exr8drqraf — kate clark (@kateclarktweets) january 9, 2019 8. meanwhile, in startup land… this week edtech startup emeritus, a u.s.-indian company that partners with universities to offer digital courses, landed a $40 million series c round led by sequoia india. badi, which uses an algorithm to help millennials find roommates, brought in a $30 million series b led by goodwater capital. and mr jeff, an on-demand laundry service startup, bagged a $12 million series a. 9. finally, meet caper, the ai self-checkout shopping cart the startup, which makes a shopping cart with a built-in barcode scanner and credit card swiper, has revealed a total of $3 million, including a $2.15 million seed round led by first round capital . want more techcrunch newsletters? sign up here."
"tetrate — a company bringing commercial services and support to the open-source projects istio and envoy, providing network management functions for the microservices that make up modern mobile applications — has launched with $12.5 million in new financing. the company, founded by top engineers at google who started the istio project, raised its initial financing from a slew of institutions and big names in enterprise software, including pankaj patel, former chief development officer at cisco; guido appenzeller, former cto cloud & networking at vmware; bv jagadeesh, founder and ceo of netscaler and shiva rajaraman, chief product officer of wework. on the institutional investment side, dell technologies capital led the financing, which also included intel capital, samsung next, 8vc and rain capital. tetrate was able to bring this motley band of investors together to back its foray into professionalizing services and support around a toolkit that’s helping to redefine application development. the company is supporting open-source projects istio and envoy, which developers use to create what’s called a “service mesh” that orchestrates how microservices on a distributed data center platform communicate with one another and work together as part of an application. its corollary in the old software world that i initially wrote about would be the middleware layer in a client-server architecture. (much of this was foreign to me before i read this excellent primer from zdnet, which spelled out a lot of what’s going on). one of the key things that microservices address, and that tetrate will provide support for, is to support the management of different microservices at scale. think of the service mesh as the toolkit that keeps microservices communicating with each other and enabling applications at the level of executable code. so tools like istio are used to manage the network without impacting the services that are running on top of it. tetrate was actually founded by some of the architects behind the development of istio. “i was at google for the last 10 years, most recently working as a product manager in google cloud,” says tetrate co-founder and chief executive varun talwar. indeed, google was where talwar and his colleagues developed the istio toolkit. talwar says that the istio toolkit was born out of the needs of the developers in the kubernetes community. “it decouples the operations from the development,” talwar says of the istio service. “you can apply policy management.” talwar and his colleagues took the covers off the istio project in may of 2017 at glucon and brought in big names to support its use, including ibm and red hat (now ibhat? redbm?). a little less than one year later, talwar left google to start tetrate. now, with the new financing from its backers, tetrate is going to bring enterprise-grade extensibility, scalability and performance to the open-source tools that its founders helped develop, according to a statement. “customers are going through a journey of modernization and public cloud adoption,” said talwar, in a statement. “tetrate’s mission is to create the tools and technologies that help customers with availability and manageability of their applications as they undergo this transformation.” the company is releasing a set of certified builds of envoy proxy and other open-source tools to speed the adoption of microservices development in businesses. the company is also partnering with google and the cloud native computing foundation for operating hybrid computing environments with istio. “open source should be an integral part of any company’s software and operations strategy today,” said envoy founder and lyft engineer matt klein, in a statement. “interoperability will be the key factor in the next phase of cloud adoption, so having deep roots within the open source community gives tetrate instant credibility among cloud-first companies.”"
"money talks in the startup community, especially when softbank comes knocking with the megabucks of its vision fund. despite the public outcry around the firm’s dependence on money from saudi arabia in the wake of that country’s assassination of washington post journalist jamal khashoggi, deal flow for softbank’s vision fund appears to be back to normal. the $100 billion megafund has done 21 deals over the last two quarters; that’s more than in the other quarters of the previous year combined, according to data from crunchbase, thanks to an uptick from asia. since the october 2 murder, there have been 11 investments in u.s. companies, seven in asia, two in europe and one in latin america. just this week, the fund completed a near $1.5 billion investment in southeast asia-based ride-hailing company grab. while u.s. and european firms have more options, and therefore, perhaps deserve more scrutiny, softbank’s cash is increasingly the only game in town for startups in asia, where there are fewer alternatives for later-stage capital outside of large chinese private equity firms or tech giants — which come with their own risks. the vision fund is seen by some critics as tainted money for its links to the saudi royal family. saudi arabia’s public investment fund (pif) is the fund’s anchor investor and is controlled by crown prince mohammad bin salman, who has been strongly linked with the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the regime. khashoggi, a washington post columnist, was murdered on october 2 after he entered the saudi consulate in istanbul. his visit was part of an effort to obtain divorce documents in order to marry his fiancée, but it ended with his apparently gruesome death. audio clips suggest he was beheaded, dismembered and had his fingers severed before his body was dissolved in acid, although new reports suggest it may have been burned. jamal khashoggi — pictured in 2014 — was murdered in the saudi consulate in istanbul last year [photographer: ohammed al-shaikh/afp/getty images]the vision fund is designed to finance “global winners,” which, like all investment funds, is set up to provide “unfair advantages” to help its companies grow into hugely important businesses. on the financial end, as is the norm, it is built to provide handsome returns to the lps, thus directly boosting the coffers of the pif, the saudi kingdom and, by extension, the saudi prince himself. an investigation is ongoing, but there’s already plenty of evidence to suggest that the murder happened at the request of the prince. sources within the u.s. state department have reportedly said it is “blindingly obvious” that the crown prince ordered the killing — he reportedly threatened to shoot khashoggi one year before. but, now that the apparent period of outrage is over, softbank has reverted back to writing checks and companies are taking them in spite of the links to saudi arabia. for startups, the money flow means that a major source of capital for growth or subsidies for customers comes from the saudi royal family’s pockets — a regime that would reportedly not hesitate to murder a critical voice. softbank’s vision fund has ramped up its deals over the past six months, according to data from crunchbase what are the companies saying? softbank itself said it has a commitment to “the people” of saudi arabia that will see it deploy its capital unchanged, although chairman masayoshi son did concede that he will wait on the findings of the investigation into the murder before deciding on whether pif will be involved in a second vision fund. the founders taking the capital have been more cautious. when questioned, executives talk about the specifics of their deal and their growth plans; most defer issues on the management of lps, like pif, to softbank. while offering words in support of the ongoing murder investigation, they manage to say little about the ethics of taking money from the saudi regime. bom kim, ceo of korean e-commerce company coupang — which raised $2 billion from the vision fund — told techcrunch in november that the allegations around the murder “don’t represent us and don’t represent [vision fund] companies.” “we are deeply concerned by the reported events and alongside softbank are monitoring the situation closely until the full facts are known,” tokopedia ceo william tanuwijaya told techcrunch in december after the vision fund co-led a $1.1 billion round. william tanuwijaya is the co-founder and ceo of tokopedia [photographer: jason alden/bloomberg]oyo, the budget hotel network based out of india, did not respond to a request for comment sent the day before this story was published. the startup raised $1 billion led by the vision fund in september. techcrunch was also unable to get a response to questions sent to chehaoduo, the vision fund’s first china-based startup, which raised $1.5 billion in february. the company is notable for being the only one of this group that didn’t count softbank as an existing investor prior to its vision fund deal. the latest addition to the collection is grab, the ride-hailing company in southeast asia that’s led by ceo anthony tan, who is very publicly a devout christian. in a statement sent to techcrunch this week, grab defended its relationship with softbank, which first invested in grab back in 2014: what happened to jamal khashoggi was obviously horrible. we hope whoever is responsible is held accountable. we are not in a position to comment on behalf of softbank but from our perspective son-san and the entire softbank team have brought so much value to the table for grab – beyond just financing. they have brought advice, mentorship and potential business opportunities. the vision fund is about investing for the next 100 or 200 years and investing in trends that will move the needle for humanity in positive ways. this is a lofty and ultimately positive goal. anthony tan is the co-founder and chief executive officer of grab [photographer: ore huiying/bloomberg/getty images]the vision fund is just getting started in asia, however, with rumors suggesting it is planning to open offices in china and india. singapore is presumably on that list, too, while the fund has been busy hiring a general team that will operate globally out of the u.s. to date, the fund’s focus in asia has been on some of the region’s largest (highest-valued) companies, but as it develops a local presence it is likely to seek out less obvious deals to grow its portfolio. that’s going to mean this question of ethics and conscience around the vision fund’s capital will present itself to more founders in asia. going on what we’ve seen so far, most will have no problem taking the money and issuing platitudinous statements. privately, vcs in the region whom we have canvassed have said that founders have little choice but to take the vision fund’s money. they explain that nobody else can offer billion-dollar-sized checks, while softbank is an existing investor in many of them already, which gives it additional leverage. the fund also takes the aggressive approach of threatening to back rival companies if it doesn’t get the deals it wants, as we saw when son said he’d consider a deal with lyft when its uber investment was uncertain. that reality may be true — finding an alternative to a hypothetical $1 billion vision fund check is a daunting challenge — but we’ve reached a very sad time and place when the sheer size of an investment overrides important concerns about where that money came from."
"for a long time, it was the norm for founders to haul their hardware to the 3000 block of sand hill road, where the venture capitalists of “silicon valley” would be awaiting their pitches. today, many of the investors that touted the exclusivity of “the valley” have moved north to san francisco, where they have better access to top entrepreneurs. y combinator, a silicon valley institution and to many the lifeblood of the startups and venture capital ecosystem, is the latest to pack up shop. yc, which invests $150,000 for 7 percent equity in a few hundred startups per year, is currently searching for a space in sf to operate its accelerator program, sources close to yc confirm to techcrunch, because the majority of yc’s employees and its portfolio founders reside in the city. founded in 2005, yc’s roots are in mountain view, california. in its first four years, yc offered programs in cambridge, massachusetts and mountain view before opting in 2009 to focus exclusively on the valley. in late 2013, as more and more of its partners and portfolio companies were establishing themselves in sf, yc opened a satellite office in the city in what would be the beginning of its journey northbound. the small satellite office, used to support sf-based staff and provide portfolio companies resources and workspace, is located in union square. the fate of yc’s mountain view office is unclear. yc’s move north will be the latest in a series of small changes that, together, point to a new era for the accelerator. approaching its 15th birthday, yc announced in september it was changing up the way it invests. no longer would it seed startups with $120,000 for 7 percent equity, it would give startups an additional 30,000 to cover the expenses of getting a business off the ground and it would admit a whole lot more companies. yc began mentoring its largest cohort of companies to date in late 2018. the astonishing 200-plus group in its winter 2019 batch is more than 50 percent larger than the 132-team cohort that graduated in spring 2018. to accommodate the truly gigantic group at yc demo days later this month (march 18 and 19), yc has moved to a new venue, sf’s pier 48. historically, yc demo days were hosted at the computer history museum near its home in mountain view. yc has also ditched “investor day,” which is typically an opportunity for investors to schedule meetings with startups that just completed the accelerator program. yc writes that the decision came “after analyzing its effectiveness.” on top of that, rumors suggest yc is planning to put an end to demo days. other accelerators, angelpad for example, put a stop to the tradition last year after realizing demo day was more of a stress to startup founders than a resource. sources close to yc, however, tell techcrunch these rumors are categorically false. yc isn’t the first accelerator to ditch its silicon valley digs. 500 startups, a smaller yet still prolific accelerator, opened an sf satellite office the same year as yc, and in 2018, the nine-year-old program made the decision to permanently relocate to sf. venture capital firms, too, have realized the opportunities are larger in sf than on sand hill road. vcs say silicon valley isn’t the gold mine it used to be the transition from the peninsula to the city began around 2012, when vc heavyweights like uber and twitter-backer benchmark opened an office in sf’s mid-market neighborhood. months later, 47-year-old kleiner perkins, an investor in stripe and doordash, opened the doors to its new workplace in sf’s south park neighborhood. around that same time a whole bunch of firms followed suit: shasta ventures, norwest venture partners, accel, gv, general catalyst and nea opened sf shops, to name a few. many of these firms, benchmark, kleiner and accel, for example, held onto their silicon valley locations. firms like true ventures and peter thiel’s founders fund planted stakes in sf years prior. both firms have operated sf offices since 2005; true ventures, for its part, has managed a palo alto office from the get-go, as well. “when we first started, it was [expected] that it would be maybe 60-40 peninsula to the city; it’s actually turned out to be 80-20 sf to the valley,” true ventures co-founder phil black told techcrunch. “for us, it was important to be near our customer: the founder. it’s important for us to be in and around where founders are doing their things.” the transition out of the valley is ongoing. other vc funds are still in the process of opening their first sf offices as more partners beg for shorter commutes. khosla ventures, for example, is currently searching for an sf headquarters. silicon valley real estate will likely remain a hot — or warm, at least — commodity, however. why? because long-time investors have lives established in that part of the bay, where they’ve built homes in well-kept, affluent cities like woodside, atherton and los altos. still, y combinator’s move highlights an increasingly adopted mantra: silicon valley isn’t the goldmine it used to be. for the best deals and greatest access to entrepreneurs, sf takes the cake — for now, that is. but with rising rents and a changing attitude toward geographically diverse founders, how long sf will remain the destination for top talent is an entirely different question. y combinator’s latest batch of startups is too big for one demo day stage"
"cities are seemingly down for this new era of transportation, which entails micromobility services and ride hailing, and operators are increasingly more down to share their data with cities. now, cities just have to find out what to do with this data and how to extract learnings from it. this is where populus comes in. populus, which just raised a $3.1 million seed round from precursor ventures, relay ventures and others, helps cities make sense of the influx of transportation data. this brings the startup’s total funding to $3.85 million. the platform is designed to enable cities to access vehicle and trip data from shared-mobility operators. city planners can view where people park and ride scooters, for example, to better determine the best place to put scooter parking areas and dedicated lanes. “one of the key issues that cities face around mobility services (in general), is that these services are arriving faster than most cities can keep up,” populus ceo and co-founder regina clewlow told techcrunch via email. “they are fundamentally changing transportation choices and travel patterns in ways that are unpredictable and unmeasured, making it very difficult for cities to design and manage public infrastructure (a job that only they can do). with access to better data and more importantly, information, we are finding that our customers, such as arlington county in the d.c. area, are able to design infrastructure that can help shared mobility services grow safely and sustainably – such as new bike lanes and scooter corrals.” to date, populus works with washington, dc and cities in the sf bay area and los angeles region. given that most cities require shared-transportation operators to share data with them, it’s easy for populus to come in as a third party. populus also offers real-time data from rideshare companies to inform curbside management and pricing. back in december, populus partnered with lime to facilitate data sharing from its car-share service, limepod. populus works by having cities and operators purchase the platform on a subscription basis. populus then securely ingests and hosts the data, and proceeds to offer tools to cities and operators to better understand how residents are using the transportation services in the city. “over the past decade we have seen an explosion of shared mobility services,” precursor ventures managing partner charles hudson said in a press release. “in order to fulfill their promises of delivering safer, equitable, and efficient streets, shared mobility operators will require platform partners like populus to facilitate their continued growth. the populus team’s deep technical and industry expertise are unparalleled. they’ve dedicated their careers to solving the worlds biggest urban problems, and they are building a game-changing platform that will transform the future of cities.” populus first launched its core product in september 2018. clewlow says it was her work with co-founder fletcher foti back in 2012 that inspired this company. at the time, the two were working on software to help the bay area regional transportation agency forecast the next 30 years of travel. during that work, they witnessed cities struggle to understand what were new modes of transportation at the time offered by the likes of uber and lyft. “we believed that with the rise of dockless mobility, cities would begin to start exerting their authority over managing city streets, and that data platforms would be essential to help private fleets and cities coordinate with one another to make progress on safety, efficiency, and equity goals,” clewlow said."
"waymo, the google self-driving project that spun out to become a business under alphabet, will start selling its custom lidar sensors — the technology that was at the heart of a trade secrets lawsuit last year against uber . the company announced wednesday in a blog post that it will sell its light detection and ranging sensors, or lidar, to companies outside of self-driving cars. waymo will initially target robotics, security and agricultural technology. the sales will help the company scale its autonomous technology faster, making each sensor more affordable through economies of scale, simon verghese, head of waymo’s lidar team, wrote in a medium post. lidar measures distance using laser light to generate highly accurate 3d maps of the world around the car. it’s considered by most in the self-driving car industry a key piece of technology required to safely deploy robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles (although not everyone agrees). waymo has dedicated significant resources — time, people and money — toward the development of lidar in an effort to improve their capability and lower the cost. it’s a fundamental piece of the business and in 2017 prompted the company to file a lawsuit against uber alleging theft of trade secrets by a former google engineer anthony levandowski — and the alleged use of those secrets by uber. the trial began in 2018; uber and waymo eventually reached a settlement. waymo has developed three lidar sensors. the company has been using a medium-range lidar, which is located on top of the car, since the early days of its project. engineers there developed a short-range and a long-range lidar. for now, waymo is only going to sell its laser bear honeycomb product, a short-range sensor that has a 95-degree vertical field of view and up to 360-degree horizontal fov, which allows one honeycomb sensor to “do the job of three other 3d sensors stacked on top of one another,” waymo says. the honeycomb has a minimum range of zero, which means the sensor can see objects immediately in front of it. the short-range lidar would be most useful for low-speed applications when near-object detection and avoidance is necessary. waymo does have customers already, but the company isn’t naming them just yet. and it’s not disclosing the unit price of these lidar sensors. however, looking back at comments from waymo ceo john krafcik does help home in on the price. in january 2017, krafcik said waymo engineers were able to bring the cost of lidar down 90 percent from the industry norm of $75,000 for a single top-of-the-range lidar. in other words, krafcik was telling the world that waymo’s top-of-range lidar cost about $7,500. “this is critical as we look to commercialize self-driving technology,” krafcik said at the time, during a keynote at the detroit auto show. insiders say those costs have fallen further thanks to continuous advances by the team. and considering that this short-range lidar is cheaper than the top-of-range product, the price is likely under $5,000 a unit. lowering the cost and size of lidar sensors has been a pursuit taken up by industry mainstay velodyne, which the google self-driving project, now waymo used until 2012, as well as dozens of others, including luminar, israeli startups innoviz and oryx vision, and ouster. a recent count of lidar startups hovered around 70, according to sources in the industry."
"drivezy — the startup out of india that wants to turn private car usage on its head through a car-sharing network where people lend their cars and two-wheeled vehicles but also have options to use vehicles from a fleet managed by drivezy — said it is raising more money as it gears up for the next stage of its expansion, including a launch in the u.s. in coming weeks. the company is in the process of raising $100 million in equity funding, plus another $400 million in asset financing, with the latter to help continue building out the inventory that sits alongside the vehicles provided by its users. this would technically be a series c and is being raised at a $400 million valuation, the company confirmed to me. “currently” is the key word: ankur sengupta, who heads up business development for drivezy, said in an interview that the startup will leave the round open for about a year and continue raising it on a rolling basis, with the valuation varying accordingly. “the valuation we are working at now is $400 million, but we will keep accepting investments, at different valuations,” he said. (note: this is not an entirely new way of raising rounds, but in the last few years, it has become a lot more common to see it rather than clear “series” blocks. fast-growing companies like snap and more recently grab in southeast asia have chosen this route to tap into readily available funding faster and closer to when it’s actually needed.) the company is not disclosing any names right now, except to note that it is likely to include a new, large investor from japan, and that it also has commitments from investors in the u.s., singapore and china. previous backers have included the yamaha motor company, axan partners and it-farm, as well as y combinator — where drivezy was a part of a 2016 cohort as justride, led by its five founders amit sahu, ashwarya pratap singh, vasant verma, abhishek mahajan and hemant sah. it has also been through google’s launchpad accelerator, although it doesn’t look like google is investing (yet). drivezy last raised money as recently as three months ago, a $20 million series b led by das capital, when it also raised $100 million in asset financing. alongside users’ own cars and the fleet it manages, drivezy also works in partnership with dealerships and others to provide vehicles for its inventory. between then and now, the company has seen a lot of growth. the company gets more than 53,000 bookings for cars each month, versus 37,000/month just three months ago. two-wheeled vehicles — primarily motorcycles — add nearly 30,000 more. while cars are typically booked for two to three days, two-wheeler bookings are weekly or monthly bookings. the inventory has also gone up. currently, there are 7,500 two-wheelers on the platform, with another 7,500 coming by the end this month; and 3,500 cars. (this is up from 5,000 motorbikes and scooters and 3,000 cars three months ago.) currently there are 30 dealerships and more than 25 banks and other financial companies in drivezy’s network. drivezy’s growth is coming at what seems to be a key inflection point for the transportation industry. some believe the days of vehicle ownership in mature markets like the u.s. are numbered, with several developments helping that trend along: the rise of over-expensive self-driving cars that many will not be able to afford; the proliferation of affordable uber-style services; and the emergence of startups like getaround (which will be a direct competitor to drivezy when it comes to the u..s) and fair to make it easy and cheap to procure a car ride without buying a car or using old-school car-rental services. but in developing markets like india, vehicle ownership is already a relative rarity, even if the desire to use a car is not: currently only 7 percent of indians own a car and 16 percent own two-wheelers. “that’s meant that the auto industry has been slow to grow here,” sengupta said. (that, plus patchy public transport in many urban areas, has also meant a lot of growth, incidentally, for the likes of ola.) drivezy’s response has been to create a completely new supply chain for private car and two-wheeled vehicle usage. customers include people who are not able to purchase a car, those who do have cars but would appreciate some income to help pay off the loans they took to get them, plus car companies and dealerships looking for new avenues and business models to shift more vehicles. currently, the p2p side of the business is most popular on the car side of the business, where 70 percent of the inventory has been listed by private owners, while only 35 percent of the two-wheelers come from private owners (all the p2p vehicles get a “fitness check.” most of the rest are listed by asset financing companies through spvs on a revenue sharing basis, with less than 2 percent on drivezy’s own books. these, sengupta said, have been purchased to meet licensing obligations in india. while drivezy has definitely benefited from useful market conditions — low vehicle ownership and a rapidly growing tech-savvy middle class with disposable income and more reasons for travelling — now the plan will be to take its model to other markets, including both those that have similar conditions to india’s, as well as those that are more developed (and hence, more competitive). that will include the u.s., where the company is planning to set up its first pilots in april to test demand in different markets and market segments, sengupta said. while it’s a very different market — and certainly more competitive when you consider the likes of getaround, turo, fair and others — drivezy (its founders having spent time there going through y combinator and google’s accelerator) thinks there is a gap in the area of microlending and the fact that even with a lot of options already, there can be more. “people have aspirational needs, they want better cars, bmws and audis for example, and there are no companies tackling the issue of bringing the cost of renting these models down,” sengupta said. considering that there is also a burgeoning market for scooters in the country, that could also be an area where drivezy will get involved. the pilot/expansion in the u.s. will come alongside building and hiring for an innovations lab in the country, a pattern that drivezy will also be following when it expands in asia, as well. other countries where it plans to go this year, he said, include indonesia, thailand and singapore. it’s not often that you hear about startups out of india expanding to the u.s., so that in itself (in my opinion) is a great story about how the gravitational pull of the tech world has indeed shifted away from silicon valley. ultimately, the international expansion to north america and other markets will serve a dual purpose for drivezy. not only will it help the company grow business, but it’s putting the company on the map, and that too will help attract more funding attention."
"ola, uber’s key rival in india, is doubling down on electric vehicles after it spun out a dedicated business, which has pulled in $56 million in early funding. the unit is named ola electric mobility and is described as being an independent business that’s backed by ola. techcrunch understands ola provided founding capital, and it has now been joined by a series of investors who have pumped rs. 400 crore ($56 million) into ola electric. notably, those backers include tiger global and matrix india — two firms that were early investors in ola itself. while automotive companies and ride-hailing services in the u.s. are focused on bringing autonomous vehicles to the streets, india — like other parts of asia — is more challenging thanks to diverse geographies, more sparse mapping and other factors. in india, companies have instead flocked to electric. the government had previously voiced its intention to make 30 percent of vehicles electric by 2030, but it has not formally introduced a policy to guide that initiative. ola has taken steps to electrify its fleet — it pledged last year to add 10,000 electric rickshaws to its fleet and has conducted other pilots with the goal of offering one million evs by 2022 — but the challenge is such that it has spun out ola electric to go deeper into evs. that means that ola electric won’t just be concerned with vehicles, it has a far wider remit. the new company has pledged to focus on areas that include charging solutions, ev batteries and developing viable infrastructure that allows commercial evs to operate at scale, according to an announcement. in other words, the challenge of developing electric vehicles goes beyond being a “ride-hailing problem” and that is why ola electric has been formed and is being capitalized independently of ola. an electric rickshaw from ola ola electric is led by ola executives anand shah and ankit jain — who led ola’s connected car platform strategy — and the team includes former executives from car makers such as bmw. already, it said it has partnered with “several” oems and battery makers and it “intends to work closely with the automotive industry to create seamless solutions for electric vehicle operations.” indeed, that connected car play — ola play — likely already gives it warm leads to chase. “at ola electric, our mission is to enable sustainable mobility for everyone. india can leapfrog problems of pollution and energy security by moving to electric mobility, create millions of new jobs and economic opportunity, and lead the world,” ola ceo and co-founder bhavish aggarwal said in a statement. “the first problem to solve in electric mobility is charging: users need a dependable, convenient and affordable replacement for the petrol pump. by making electric easy for commercial vehicles that deliver a disproportionate share of kilometers traveled, we can jumpstart the electric vehicle revolution,” added anand shah, whose job title is listed as head of ola electric mobility. the new business spin-out comes as ola continues to raise new capital from investors. last month, flipkart co-founder sachin bansal invested $92 million into the ongoing series j round that is likely to exceed $1 billion and would value ola at around $6 billion. existing backer steadview capital earlier committed $75 million, but there’s plenty more in development. a filing — first noted by paper.vc — shows that india’s competition commission approved a request for a temasek-affiliated investment vehicle’s proposed acquisition of seven percent of ola. in addition, softbank offered a term sheet for a prospective $1 billion investment last month, techcrunch understands from an industry source. ola is backed by the likes of softbank, tencent, sequoia india, matrix, dst global and didi chuxing. it has raised some $3.5 billion to date, according to data from crunchbase."
"brightcove just announced that it’s acquiring ooyala’s online video platform business. the deal brings together two long-lasting players in the online video industry. brightcove was founded in 2004 and went public in 2012, while ooyala was founded in 2007 and was acquired by telstra before management bought back the company last fall. (back when it was part of telstra, ooyala sued brightcove for alleged theft of trade secrets.) when ooyala had become newly independent, ceo jonathan huberman said the company had two main businesses, its video platform and its media workflow tools — and although the video platform accounted for the majority of its business, huberman saw more opportunity on the workflow side. brightcove says the deal includes ooyala’s video content management and publishing platform backlot, analytics, live and the underlying ip. it also says it will be bringing on “substantial portions” of the ooyala team, including its operations in guadalajara, mexico. in the acquisition release, brightcove ceo jeff ray said: ooyala has tremendous global customers who understand the power of video and its ability to transform business and reach new customers. this transaction, which includes immediately growing our highly skilled and committed global workforce, accelerates our ability to deliver faster innovation and deeper support for all customers. we also will increase our market reach and further strengthen our ability to secure new business in key target markets. we look forward to welcoming ooyala’s ovp customers and ensuring a smooth transition and a world-class experience for them. update: brightcove says it disclosed the price in its earnings call — approximately $15 million, consisting of $6.25 million in cash and the rest in brightcove shares. brightcove co-founder jeremy allaire will step down as ceo, david mendels to take over"
"the day has finally come. u.s. ride-hailing giant lyft has unveiled its s-1, the official document required by the securities and exchange commission to go public. the san francisco-headquartered business will debut on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “lyft.” jpmorgan chase & co., credit suisse group ag and jefferies financial group inc. will lead the initial public offering expected to value lyft at upwards of $20 billion, a significant leap from its most recent private valuation of $15.1 billion. the company hasn’t determined how many shares it will sell or a price range. the filing currently lists an offering size of $100 million, though that is typically a placeholder amount. according to the filing, lyft recorded $2.2 billion in revenue in 2018, more than double the $1 billion recorded in 2017. meanwhile, losses have been growing considerably. the company posted a net loss of $911 million on the $2.2 billion in revenue and a $688 million loss on 2017’s $1 billion. lyft currently holds 34 percent of the u.s. ridesharing market, a figure the company has been working tirelessly to increase as it gears up for its ipo. uber holds the remaining 66 percent. lyft’s key stakeholders include rakuten, a japanese e-commerce giant, which boasts a 13 percent pre-ipo stake, general motors (7.76 percent), fidelity (7.1 percent), andreessen horowitz (6.25 percent) and alphabet (5.3 percent). founded in 2007, lyft has raised $5.1 billion in venture capital funding to date. the business raised an additional $600 million in series i funding led by fidelity in june, its last round of private investment. other investors in lyft include alliancebernstein, baillie gifford, kkr, janus capitalg and ontario teachers’ pension plan. lyft riders took 30.1 million rides in 2018, per the filing. the company has recorded a total of 1 billion rides and operates in 300 markets."
"somewhat similar to uber’s express pool option, lyft just launched shared saver to help people spend less money for shared rides. but what makes lyft’s option more attractive is that riders will never experience surge pricing. “you’ll lock in the lowest prices, always — even when it’s busy,” lyft wrote in a blog post today. shared saver rides require customers to walk to a designated pickup location, which will be a maximum of a few blocks away, to meet your driver and co-riders. same goes for your drop-off location. lyft’s long-term plan entails encouraging more people to take shared rides. last june, lyft updated its app to make shared rides much more visible. as of june 2018, 35 percent of lyft rides were shared. lyft’s goal is to hit 50 percent shared rides by 2020, lyft vp of government relations joseph okpaku told techcrunch at the time."
"few issues divide the tech community quite like privacy. much of silicon valley’s wealth has been built on data-driven advertising platforms, and yet, there remain constant concerns about the invasiveness of those platforms. such concerns have intensified in just the last few weeks as france’s privacy regulator placed a record fine on google under europe’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) rules which the company now plans to appeal. yet with global platform usage and service sales continuing to tick up, we asked a panel of eight privacy experts: “has anything fundamentally changed around privacy in tech in 2019? what is the state of privacy and has the outlook changed?”  this week’s participants include: albert gidari – consulting director of privacy at stanford’s center for internet and society; professor at stanford law school gabriel weinberg – ceo and founder of duckduckgo melika carroll -senior vp of global government affairs at the internet association johnny ryan – chief policy and industry relations officer at brave john miller –  vp of global policy and law at the information technology industry council nuala o’connor – president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology chris baker – senior vp and general manager of emea at box christopher wolf – founder and chair of the future privacy forum; senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing on internet law, privacy and data protection policy techcrunch is experimenting with new content forms. consider this a recurring venue for debate, where leading experts – with a diverse range of vantage points and opinions – provide us with thoughts on some of the biggest issues currently in tech, startups and venture. if you have any feedback, please reach out: arman.tabatabai@techcrunch.com. thoughts & responses: albert gidari albert gidari is the consulting director of privacy at the stanford center for internet and society. he was a partner for over 20 years at perkins coie llp, achieving a top-ranking in privacy law by chambers, before retiring to consult with cis on its privacy program. he negotiated the first-ever “privacy by design” consent decree with the federal trade commission. a recognized expert on electronic surveillance law, he brought the first public lawsuit before the foreign intelligence surveillance court, seeking the right of providers to disclose the volume of national security demands received and the number of affected user accounts, ultimately resulting in greater public disclosure of such requests. there is no doubt that the privacy environment changed in 2018 with the passage of california’s consumer privacy act (ccpa), implementation of the european union’s general data protection regulation (gdpr), and new privacy laws enacted around the globe. “while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.”” for one thing, large tech companies have grown huge privacy compliance organizations to meet their new regulatory obligations. for another, the major platforms now are lobbying for passage of a federal privacy law in the u.s. this is not surprising after a year of privacy miscues, breaches and negative privacy news. but does all of this mean a fundamental change is in store for privacy? i think not. the fundamental model sustaining the internet is based upon the exchange of user data for free service. as long as advertising dollars drive the growth of the internet, regulation simply will tinker around the edges, setting sideboards to dictate the terms of the exchange. the tech companies may be more accountable for how they handle data and to whom they disclose it, but the fact is that data will continue to be collected from all manner of people, places and things. indeed, if the past year has shown anything it is that two rules are fundamental: (1) everything that can be connected to the internet will be connected; and (2) everything that can be collected, will be collected, analyzed, used and monetized. it is inexorable. while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.” no one even knows what “more privacy” means. if it means that users will have more control over the data they share, that is laudable but not achievable in a world where people have no idea how many times or with whom they have shared their information already. can you name all the places over your lifetime where you provided your ssn and other identifying information? and given that the largest data collector (and likely least secure) is government, what does control really mean? all this is not to say that privacy regulation is futile. but it is to recognize that nothing proposed today will result in a fundamental shift in privacy policy or provide a panacea of consumer protection. better privacy hygiene and more accountability on the part of tech companies is a good thing, but it doesn’t solve the privacy paradox that those same users who want more privacy broadly share their information with others who are less trustworthy on social media (ask jeff bezos), or that the government hoovers up data at rate that makes tech companies look like pikers (visit a smart city near you). many years ago, i used to practice environmental law. i watched companies strive to comply with new laws intended to control pollution by creating compliance infrastructures and teams aimed at preventing, detecting and deterring violations. today, i see the same thing at the large tech companies – hundreds of employees have been hired to do “privacy” compliance. the language is the same too: cradle to grave privacy documentation of data flows for a product or service; audits and assessments of privacy practices; data mapping; sustainable privacy practices. in short, privacy has become corporatized and industrialized. true, we have cleaner air and cleaner water as a result of environmental law, but we also have made it lawful and built businesses around acceptable levels of pollution. companies still lawfully dump arsenic in the water and belch volatile organic compounds in the air. and we still get environmental catastrophes. so don’t expect today’s “clean privacy law” to eliminate data breaches or profiling or abuses. the privacy world is complicated and few people truly understand the number and variety of companies involved in data collection and processing, and none of them are in congress. the power to fundamentally change the privacy equation is in the hands of the people who use the technology (or choose not to) and in the hands of those who design it, and maybe that’s where it should be. gabriel weinberg gabriel weinberg is the founder and ceo of privacy-focused search engine duckduckgo. coming into 2019, interest in privacy solutions is truly mainstream. there are signs of this everywhere (media, politics, books, etc.) and also in duckduckgo’s growth, which has never been faster. with solid majorities now seeking out private alternatives and other ways to be tracked less online, we expect governments to continue to step up their regulatory scrutiny and for privacy companies like duckduckgo to continue to help more people take back their privacy. “consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information.” we’re also seeing companies take action beyond mere regulatory compliance, reflecting this new majority will of the people and its tangible effect on the market. just this month we’ve seen apple’s tim cook call for stronger privacy regulation and the new york times report strong ad revenue in europe after stopping the use of ad exchanges and behavioral targeting. at its core, this groundswell is driven by the negative effects that stem from the surveillance business model. the percentage of people who have noticed ads following them around the internet, or who have had their data exposed in a breach, or who have had a family member or friend experience some kind of credit card fraud or identity theft issue, reached a boiling point in 2018. on top of that, people learned of the extent to which the big platforms like google and facebook that collect the most data are used to propagate misinformation, discrimination, and polarization. consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information. fortunately, there are alternatives to the surveillance business model and more companies are setting a new standard of trust online by showcasing alternative models. melika carroll melika carroll is senior vice president, global government affairs at internet association, which represents over 45 of the world’s leading internet companies, including google, facebook, amazon, twitter, uber, airbnb and others. we support a modern, national privacy law that provides people meaningful control over the data they provide to companies so they can make the most informed choices about how that data is used, seen, and shared. “any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online.” internet companies believe all americans should have the ability to access, correct, delete, and download the data they provide to companies. americans will benefit most from a federal approach to privacy – as opposed to a patchwork of state laws – that protects their privacy regardless of where they live. if someone in new york is video chatting with their grandmother in florida, they should both benefit from the same privacy protections. it’s also important to consider that all companies – both online and offline – use and collect data. any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online. two other important pieces of any federal privacy law include user expectations and the context in which data is shared with third parties. expectations may vary based on a person’s relationship with a company, the service they expect to receive, and the sensitivity of the data they’re sharing. for example, you expect a car rental company to be able to track the location of the rented vehicle that doesn’t get returned. you don’t expect the car rental company to track your real-time location and sell that data to the highest bidder. additionally, the same piece of data can have different sensitivities depending on the context in which it’s used or shared. for example, your name on a business card may not be as sensitive as your name on the sign in sheet at an addiction support group meeting. this is a unique time in washington as there is bipartisan support in both chambers of congress as well as in the administration for a federal privacy law. our industry is committed to working with policymakers and other stakeholders to find an american approach to privacy that protects individuals’ privacy and allows companies to innovate and develop products people love. johnny ryan dr. johnny ryan frhists is chief policy & industry relations officer at brave. his previous roles include head of ecosystem at pagefair, and chief innovation officer of the irish times. he has a phd from the university of cambridge, and is a fellow of the royal historical society. tech companies will probably have to adapt to two privacy trends. “as lawmakers and regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware.” first, the gdpr is emerging as a de facto international standard. in the coming years, the application of gdpr-like laws for commercial use of consumers’ personal data in the eu, britain (post-eu), japan, india, brazil, south korea, malaysia, argentina, and china will bring more than half of global gdp under a similar standard. whether this emerging standard helps or harms united states firms will be determined by whether the united states enacts and actively enforces robust federal privacy laws. unless there is a federal gdpr-like law in the united states, there may be a degree of friction and the potential of isolation for united states companies. however, there is an opportunity in this trend. the united states can assume the global lead by doing two things. first, enact a federal law that borrows from the gdpr, including a comprehensive definition of “personal data”, and robust “purpose specification”. second, invest in world-leading regulation that pursues test cases, and defines practical standards. cutting edge enforcement of common principles-based standards is de facto leadership. second, privacy and antitrust law are moving closer to each other, and might squeeze big tech companies very tightly indeed. big tech companies “cross-use” user data from one part of their business to prop up others. the result is that a company can leverage all the personal information accumulated from its users in one line of business, and for one purpose, to dominate other lines of business too. this is likely to have anti-competitive effects. rather than competing on the merits, the company can enjoy the unfair advantage of massive network effects even though it may be starting from scratch in a new line of business. this stifles competition and hurts innovation and consumer choice. antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions have addressed this. in 2015, the belgian national lottery was fined for re-using personal information acquired through its monopoly for a different, and incompatible, line of business. as lawmakers and regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware. john miller john miller is the vp for global policy and law at the information technology industry council (iti), a d.c. based advocate group for the high tech sector.  miller leads iti’s work on cybersecurity, privacy, surveillance, and other technology and digital policy issues. data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike. however, as times change and innovation progresses at a rapid rate, it’s clear the laws protecting consumers’ data and privacy must evolve as well. “data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike.” as the global regulatory landscape shifts, there is now widespread agreement among business, government, and consumers that we must modernize our privacy laws, and create an approach to protecting consumer privacy that works in today’s data-driven reality, while still delivering the innovations consumers and businesses demand. more and more, lawmakers and stakeholders acknowledge that an effective privacy regime provides meaningful privacy protections for consumers regardless of where they live. approaches, like the framework iti released last fall, must offer an interoperable solution that can serve as a model for governments worldwide, providing an alternative to a patchwork of laws that could create confusion and uncertainty over what protections individuals have. companies are also increasingly aware of the critical role they play in protecting privacy. looking ahead, the tech industry will continue to develop mechanisms to hold us accountable, including recommendations that any privacy law mandate companies identify, monitor, and document uses of known personal data, while ensuring the existence of meaningful enforcement mechanisms. nuala o’connor nuala o’connor is president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology, a global nonprofit committed to the advancement of digital human rights and civil liberties, including privacy, freedom of expression, and human agency. o’connor has served in a number of presidentially appointed positions, including as the first statutorily mandated chief privacy officer in u.s. federal government when she served at the u.s. department of homeland security. o’connor has held senior corporate leadership positions on privacy, data, and customer trust at amazon, general electric, and doubleclick. she has practiced at several global law firms including sidley austin and venable. she is an advocate for the use of data and internet-enabled technologies to improve equity and amplify marginalized voices. for too long, americans’ digital privacy has varied widely, depending on the technologies and services we use, the companies that provide those services, and our capacity to navigate confusing notices and settings. “americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away.” we are burdened with trying to make informed choices that align with our personal privacy preferences on hundreds of devices and thousands of apps, and reading and parsing as many different policies and settings. no individual has the time nor capacity to manage their privacy in this way, nor is it a good use of time in our increasingly busy lives. these notices and choices and checkboxes have become privacy theater, but not privacy reality. in 2019, the legal landscape for data privacy is changing, and so is the public perception of how companies handle data. as more information comes to light about the effects of companies’ data practices and myriad stewardship missteps, americans are surprised and shocked about what they’re learning. they’re increasingly paying attention, and questioning why they are still overburdened and unprotected. and with intensifying scrutiny by the media, as well as state and local lawmakers, companies are recognizing the need for a clear and nationally consistent set of rules. personal privacy is the cornerstone of the digital future people want. americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away. the center for democracy & technology wants to help craft those legal principles to solidify americans’ digital privacy rights for the first time. chris baker chris baker is senior vice president and general manager of emea at box. last year saw data privacy hit the headlines as businesses and consumers alike were forced to navigate the implementation of gdpr. but it’s far from over. “…customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed” 2019 will be the year that the rest of the world catches up to the legislative example set by europe, as similar data regulations come to the forefront. organizations must ensure they are compliant with regional data privacy regulations, and more gdpr-like policies will start to have an impact. this can present a headache when it comes to data management, especially if you’re operating internationally. however, customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed, and customers can rest assured knowing that no matter where they are in the world, businesses must meet the highest bar possible when it comes to data security. starting with the u.s., 2019 will see larger corporations opt-in to gdpr to support global business practices. at the same time, local data regulators will lift large sections of the eu legislative framework and implement these rules in their own countries. 2018 was the year of gdpr in europe, and 2019 be the year of gdpr globally. christopher wolf christopher wolf is the founder and chair of the future of privacy forum think tank, and is senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing on internet law, privacy and data protection policy. with the eu gdpr in effect since last may (setting a standard other nations are emulating), “regardless of the outcome of the debate over a new federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede.” with the adoption of a highly-regulatory and broadly-applicable state privacy law in california last summer (and similar laws adopted or proposed in other states), and with intense focus on the data collection and sharing practices of large tech companies, the time may have come where congress will adopt a comprehensive federal privacy law. complicating the adoption of a federal law will be the issue of preemption of state laws and what to do with the highly-developed sectoral laws like hippa and gramm-leach-bliley. also to be determined is the expansion of ftc regulatory powers. regardless of the outcome of the debate over a new federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede."
"the battle between uber and lyft, which are both expected to go public this year, continues. today, lyft announced the hire of michelle debella, formerly uber’s global head of internal audit, as its own vp of finance strategy. debella will be responsible for ensuring lyft meets its objectives around scaling. she’ll systematically review lyft’s operations, examine its risks and ensure the company is set up for success. previously, debella spent eight years at hewlett-packard, where she served as vp of internal audit. “i had the pleasure of working with michelle for several years at hpe and am excited to partner with her once again at lyft,” lyft audit committee chairperson maggie wilderotter said in a statement. “michelle’s pragmatic and collaborative approach to financial leadership is exactly what we need to position lyft for future success and grow the business responsibly.”"
"blossom capital, the venture capital firm co-founded by ex-index ventures and localglobe vc ophelia brown, is announcing that it has raised an $85 million fund to invest in european tech startups at the series a stage. lps in the new fund, which techcrunch reported early details of 12 months ago, are said to span leading institutional investors, as well as high-profile tech entrepreneurs. the latter includes robinhood co-founder vladimir tenev and zendesk founder mikkel svane. meanwhile, alongside brown, blossom’s other partners are imran ghory, who previously led data-driven deal sourcing at index and was head of data insights at marketinvoice; mike hudack, who until very recently was cto at deliveroo and prior to that a director of product at facebook; and louise samet, a fairly active angel investor who previously worked at klarna as a digital product manager. also noteworthy, eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that the new vc firm appears to have lost a founding partner already: former uber china executive candice lo was previously listed on the blossom capital website as a blossom co-founder and partner, but techcrunch understands has since departed. “it’s been an honour being part of the team at blossom, but i am leaving to spend more time with family,” said lo in a statement issued to techcrunch. “the fund has reached an incredible milestone and i will be cheering the team on as they continue to grow blossom in europe.” in a call with brown late last week, she said that blossom aims to distinguish itself from other series a investors in europe by embracing a more “west coast” approach with what she calls “high conviction” investing. the firm will write larger cheques than many series a investors — in the region of $5 million to $10 million — and plans to do only four-five deals per year, which, again, is quite unusual. the idea is to place fewer but bigger (and potentially riskier) bets and give the limited number of companies blossom backs enough runway to get to a meaningful series b. arguably, it also means the blossom team, which remains small, won’t be spreading too thin the support offered to its portfolio. on that note, blossom has already backed four companies: duffel, fat llama, frontify and sqreen. co-investors have included y combinator, greylock and index ventures — some decent names for a new firm, to say the least. another aspect that brown talked up is blossom’s use of data to source and support deals. both partners ghory and hudack have technical backgrounds — which should make them especially technical-founder-friendly — and i’m told the firm has developed technology that pulls in various data to look for signals of promising companies across europe’s disparate and fragmented ecosystem. the thinking, says brown, is to ensure a small firm like blossom can still source deals in some of europe’s more hidden tech hubs, rather than just the major ecosystems. she declined to go into much detail on exactly what data is being used, obviously careful not to give away any of blossom’s secret source. more broadly, vcs are increasingly pinning more of their success on the use of data, whether that be throwing data scientists and analysts at the problem or building bespoke software. two other european firms thought to be taking a similar approach to blossom are london-based inreach ventures and berlin’s fly vc. “if you look at the big outcomes in europe, around 70 percent of them today came from outside of the major hubs, in countries such as romania, finland and portugal,” writes brown in a blog post. “data allows us to cover the entire continent, not just the major and overfished capitals like london, paris, berlin and stockholm.”"
"tesla and spacex ceo elon musk has been teasing — and his fan base has been making pleas — to host a meme review. and after tweeted hints, meme review has arrived via youtube star pewdiepie. musk tweeted last month a photo and a question “host meme review?” host meme review? pic.twitter.com/k2sftiuh1k — elon musk (@elonmusk) january 27, 2019 on friday, musk and justin roiland, one of the creators of adult swim’s rick and morty, appeared on youtuber pewdiepie’s show for a meme review. during the segment, musk and roiland rate various memes, like the one pictured below. the pair provide commentary and funny quips. it looks like musk and roiland’s appearance has helped push pewdiepie above t-series, an indian music company on youtube that has had the most subscribers. pewdiepie now has about a 20,000 subscriber lead. the final meme, which pictures what appears to be a dead deer at the bottom of a pool, is what pushes musk over the edge when he asks, “jeez is that true? what, that actually happened? oh my god,” as he bursts into fits of uncomfortable laughter. you can watch the whole episode that pewdiepie uploaded on february 22 or skip to about minute 13 for musk and roiland."
"some interesting m&a is afoot in the world of hardware and software that’s aiming to improve the quality of audio and video communications over digital networks. gn group — the danish company that broke new ground in mobile when it inked deals first with apple and then google to stream audio from their phones directly to smart, connected hearing aids — is expanding from audio to video, and from europe to silicon valley. today, the company announced that it would acquire altia systems, a startup out of cupertino that makes a “surround” videoconferencing device and software called the panacast (we reviewed it once) designed to replicate the panoramic, immersive experience of vision that we have as humans.  gn is paying $125 million for the startup. for some context, this price represents a decent return: according to pitchbook, altia was last valued at around $78 million with investors including intel capital and others. intel’s investment was one of several strategic partnerships that altia had inked over the years. (another was with zoom to provide a new video solution for uber.) the intel partnership, for one, will continue post-acquisition. “intel invested in altia systems to bring an industry leading immersive, panoramic-4k camera experience to business video collaboration,” said dave flanagan, vice president of intel corporation and senior managing director of intel capital, in a statement. “over the past few years, altia systems has collaborated with intel to use ai and to deliver more intelligent conference rooms and business meetings. this helps customers make better decisions, automate workflows and improve business efficiency. we are excited to work with gn to further scale this technology on a global basis.” we have seen a lot of applications of ai in just about every area of technology, but one of the less talked about, but very interesting, areas has been in how it’s being used to enhance audio in digital network. pindrop, as one example, is creating and tracking “audio fingerprints” for security applications, specifically fraud prevention (to authenticate users and to help weed out imposters based not just on the actual voice but on all the other aural cues we may not pick up as humans but can help build a picture of a caller’s location and so on). gn, meanwhile, has been building ai-based algorithms to help those who cannot hear as well, or who simply needs to hear better, be able to listen to calls on digital networks and make out what’s being said. this not only requires technology to optimise the audio quality, but also algorithms that can help tailor that quality to the specific person’s own unique hearing needs. one of the more obvious applications of services like these are for those who are hard of hearing and use hearing aids (which can be awful or impossible to use with mobile phones), another is in call centers, and this appears to be the area where gn is hoping to address with the altia acquisition. gn already offers two products for call centre workers, jabra and blueparrot — headsets and speakerphones with their own proprietary software that it claims makes workers more efficient and productive just by making it easier to understand what callers are saying. altia will be integrated into that solution to expand it to include videoconferencing around unified communications solutions, creating more natural experiences for those who are not actually in physical rooms together. “combining gn audio’s sound expertise, partner eco-system and global channel access with the video technology from altia systems, we will take the experience of conference calls to a completely new level,” said rené svendsen-tune, president and ceo of gn audio, in a statement. what’s notable is that gn is a vertically-integrated company, building not just hardware but software to run on it. the ai engine underpinning some of its software development will be getting a vast new trove of data fed into it now by way of the panacast solution: not jut in terms of video, but the large amount of audio that will naturally come along with it. “combining panacast’s immersive, intelligent video with gn audio’s intelligent audio solutions will enable us to deliver a whole new class of collaboration products for our customers,” said aurangzeb khan, president and ceo of altia systems, in a statement. “panacast’s solutions enable companies to improve meeting participants’ experience, automate workflows, and enhance business efficiency and real estate utilization with data lakes of valid information.” given gn’s work with android and ios devices, it will be interesting to see how and if these video solutions make their way to those platforms as well, either by way of solutions that work on their phones or perhaps more native integrations down the line. regardless of how that develops, what’s clear is that there remains a market not just for basic tools to get work done, but technology to improve the quality of those tools, and that’s where gn hopes it will resonate with this deal."
"the self-driving vehicle evangelists are uniting. a number of major automakers, technology companies and organizations with a stake in autonomous vehicles, including audi, aurora, cruise, gm, mobileye, nvidia, toyota, waymo and zoox has formed a coalition to spread the word about advanced vehicle technologies and self-driving vehicles. their message: this tech can transform transportation and make it safer and more sustainable. the partners for automated vehicle education, or pave, coalition was announced monday at ces 2019 in las vegas. the aim of pave is educate the public and policymakers about the potential of automated vehicles. “it is essential to engage the public and their elected representatives to shape an informed future of our roadways,” deborah a.p. hersman, president and ceo of the national safety council said monday. hersman stressed during the conference that pave is not a lobbying group. “it’s not about lobbying, it’s about education,” hersman said. “we want people to understand the benefits and the limitations.” hersman, along with audi of america, will serve as inaugural co-chairs of pave. a few automakers and tech companies including ford, fiat chrysler and aptiv weren’t included in the launch of the coalition. it’s probable that many more will join if the coalition gains momentum. there’s also no shortage of other industry-led coalitions, organizations and lobby groups focused on autonomous vehicle technology such as the automated vehicle coalition and the self-driving coalition for safer streets, which includes ford, waymo, lyft, uber and volvo. it’s time to get involved in shaping the future of transportation – and that means getting the facts about automated vehicles. we’re here to help you speak the language, understand the technology, and imagine the possibilities. https://t.co/iwzpuur8fy pic.twitter.com/ukqnsg0dys — pave campaign (@pavecampaign) january 7, 2019 pave says it will hold events across the country to introduce driver assistance and self-driving technology to consumers and policymakers, hold educational workshops aimed at federal, state and local officials, and develop educational materials to distribute to retail sales and customer service personnel. the group wants to educate the everyday consumer as well. so, it plans to sponsor hands-on workshops in partnership with sae international to give people the chance to see, touch and feel developing av technology. it will also hold policy workshops in partnership with academic institutions such as stanford university’s center for automotive research to help policymakers understand avs and their potential.  “traditional automakers and newcomers are investing billions of dollars in the technology that will make automated vehicles possible,” said mark del rosso, president, audi of america. “pave recognizes the need to invest in public information — in making sure consumers and policymakers understand what’s real, what’s possible, and what is rumor or speculation.”"
"listen, everyone. it’s not every day that a new fact comes to light regarding a game that came out more than 30 years ago. and i happen to love it when retro games get broken in fabulous and entertaining ways. so the news that the legend of zelda for nes has a minus world like super mario bros. and others hit me like a freight train. the phenomenon was discovered by youtuber skelux, who starts off his video with a quick explanation of how minus worlds work. if you think about an nes game as a big file, there are places where graphics are stored, sounds and music are described and, of course, level layouts and enemy logic are kept. as a player, you are expected to navigate the structured parts of this file, namely the game world — level 1, 2, 3, this or that dungeon or town, etc. but there are ways to escape that structure by exploiting flaws in the game’s code, letting you run free in portions of the game’s data that aren’t meant to be “real” levels — yet the game’s engine will interpret the data as best it can, producing in some cases pretty wacky but still navigable levels. this type of thing gets its name from super mario bros., where you could easily warp to a buggy level “-1” and progress from there. zelda and other games often use data trickery to get around the natural limitations of 8-bit computing and severely restricted storage space. for instance, did you know that in order to store them more efficiently, zelda’s dungeons all fit together like giant tiles? i just about lost my mind when i found out about that. note that the above is two 16×8 grids set one on top of the other. as skelux explains, the overhead map is similarly divided, except the bottom “half” isn’t actually filled with map data. and although there are cheats that let you walk through walls, the game’s code detects when you reach an invalid map coordinate and returns you to the starting location. but a little hackery takes that safety measure out of play and the result: a new world! and a horribly buggy one, as it turns out right from the start. octoroks are shooting boomerangs out of their snouts; the old man on one screen tells you it’s dangerous to go alone, then next door says “leave your life of money”; a molblin caterpillar shoots fireballs at you; glitchy inverted witch women swarm the statues of death mountain; and so on. it’s a strange, hilarious world, and one that obviously was not crafted but is simply created on the fly by the game’s engine attempting to make sense of the data it’s reading. it isn’t canon. this type of video game archaeology is endlessly fascinating to me, because it demonstrates both the fragility and the robustness of these venerable pieces of software — and, of course, the enduring love and interest they engender in fans. another one that recently absorbed my attention was the explanation of parallel dimensions inside super mario 64 and how sliding between them lets you beat a level with only half a press of the jump button. that’s all. please return to your ordinary lives, which likely seem just a bit more ordinary now that you know one more magical secret of the legend of zelda."
"as the streaming world continues to grow, startups are looking to take advantage of the opportunity and grab a slice of the pie, and indeed create new revenue models around it entirely. camelot, a yc-backed startup, is one of them. camelot allows viewers to place bounties on their favorite streamers, putting a monetary value on the things they want to see on stream. this could include in-game challenges like “win with no armor,” as well as stream bounties like “play apex” or “add a heartbeat monitor to the stream.” when a viewer posts a bounty, other viewers can join in and contribute to the overall value, and the streamer can then choose whether or not to go through with it from an admin dashboard. because internet platforms can often be used for evil alongside good, cofounder and ceo jesse zhang has thought through ways to minimize inappropriate requests. there is an option for streamers to see and approve the bounty before it’s ever made public to ensure that they avoid inappropriate propositions. bounties are also paid for up front by viewers, and either returned if the creator declines the bounty or pushed through when the streamer completes the task, raising the barrier to entry for nefarious users. camelot generates revenue by taking a five percent stake in every bounty completed. the platform isn’t just for twitch streamers — youtubers can also get in on the mix using camelot and making asynchronous videos around each bounty. not only does it offer a new way to generate revenue, but it also offers content creators the chance to get new insights on what their viewers want to see and what they value. cofounder and ceo jesse zhang believes there is opportunity to expand to streamers and youtube content creators outside of the gaming sphere in the future. for now, however, camelot is working to bring on more content creators. thus far, streamers and viewers have already come up with some interesting use cases for the product. one streamer’s audience bought his dog some treats, and one viewer of sa1na paid $100 to play against the streamer himself. camelot declined to share how much funding it has received thus far, but did say that lead investors include y combinator, the philadelphia 76ers, soma capital, and plaid cofounders william hockey and zach perret."
"lalamove, a hong kong-based on-demand logistics startup, has closed a $300 million series d round as it seeks expansion across asia. in doing so, the company has officially entered the unicorn club. founded in 2013 by stanford graduate shing chow, lalamove provides logistics and delivery services in a similar style to ride-hailing apps like uber, but it is primarily focused on business and corporate customers. that gives it more favorable economics and a more loyal customer base than its consumer-focused peers, who face discount wars to woo fickle consumers. this new round is split into two, lalamove said, with hillhouse capital leading the “d1” tranche and sequoia china heading up the “d2” portion. the company didn’t reveal the size of the two pieces of the round. other investors that took part included new backers eastern bell venture capital and pv capital and returning investors shunwei capital (the firm founded by xiaomi ceo lei jun), xiang he capital and mindworks ventures . the deal takes lalamove to more than $460 million raised to date, and it follows a $100 million series c that closed in late 2017. lalamove isn’t disclosing a valuation, but blake larson, the company’s head of international, told techcrunch that it has been “past unicorn mark for quite some time [but] we just don’t talk about it.” that figures, given the size of the round and the fact that lalamove was just shy of the $1 billion mark for that series c. the lalamove business is anchored in mainland china, where it covers more than 130 cities with a network of over two million drivers covering vans, cars and motorbikes. beyond china, lalamove is present in its native hong kong — where uber once briefly tried a similar service — taiwan, vietnam, indonesia, malaysia, singapore the philippines and thailand, where it works with popular chat app line. all told, it covers 11 cities outside of china and this new capital will go toward expanding that figure with additional city launches in southeast asia and entry to india. “if we do this well, then we are in countries that are more than half the world’s population,” larson said in an interview, although he didn’t rule out the potential for lalamove to expand beyond asia in the future. there are also plans to grow the business in china in terms of both geography and new services. already, lalamove has begun to offer driver services, starting with financing packages to help drivers with vehicle purchasing, and it is developing dedicated corporate offerings, too. lalamove ceo shing chow started lalamove in late 2013; his past roles have included time with bain & company, a number of startup ventures — including a hong kong-based skin center — and a stint as a professional poker player overall, the business claims to have registered 3 million drivers to date and served more than 28 million users across all cities. with its headquarters in hong kong, it employs some 4,000 people across its business. rival gogovan exited through a merger with china-based 58 suyun in 2017, at a claimed valuation of $1 billion, but lalamove has remained independent and stuck to its guns. larson said that already it is profitable in “a significant amount” of cities and typically, he said, the blueprint is to reach profitability within two years of opening a new location. “the focus has always been on sustainable growth and we’re very strong on the cash flow front,” the former rocket internet executive added. larson and lalamove have been very forthcoming in their desire to go public in hong kong, noting so publicly as early as 2017 at a techcrunch china event in shenzhen. that desire is still evident — “we’re very proud to be from hong kong and hong kong would be a good place for an ipo,” larson said this week — but still the company said that it has no particular plan on the cards, despite its consumer-focused peers uber and lyft lining up ipos in the u.s. this year. “we don’t spend maybe even five minutes a year talking about it,” larsen told techcrunch. “the discussion is really ‘let’s make sure we’re ipo ready’ because sometimes there are macroeconomic conditions you can’t control.” clearly, investors are bullish and it is notable that lalamove’s new round comes at a time when many chinese companies are downsizing their staff, with the likes of didi, meituan and jd.com announcing cuts and refocusing strategies in recent weeks. “[lalamove ceo and founder] shing is a role model for hong kong’s new generation of innovative entrepreneurs,” said sequoia china founder and managing partner neil shen. “raised in hong kong and educated at stanford university, shing returned and plunged himself in the entrepreneurial wave of ‘internet plus,’ becoming a figure of entrepreneurial success.”"
"ibm today announced that it is freeing its watson-branded ai services — like the watson assistant for building conversational interfaces and watson openscale for managing the ai life cycle — from its own cloud and allowing enterprises to take its platform and running it in their own data centers. in a way, you can think of this as watson as a managed service. “clients are really struggling with infusing ai into their applications because the data is distributed in multiple places,” ibm watson’s cto and chief architects ruchir puri told me when i asked him for ibm’s reasoning behind this move. “it’s in these hybrid environments, they’ve got multiple cloud implementations, they have data in their private cloud as well. they have been struggling because the providers of ai have been trying to lock them into a particular implementation that is not suitable to this hybrid cloud environment.” so with this decision of bringing watson to any cloud, ibm wants to give these businesses the option to bring ai to their data, which is significantly harder and costlier to move, after all. puri also stressed that many enterprises have long wanted to use ai to make their operations more efficient, but they needed to run their ai tools in an environment they control and feel comfortable with. at the core of the technical specifications for running watson in their public or private cloud is ibm cloud private, the company’s private cloud platform that uses open-source technologies for running tools and services like kubernetes and cloud foundry. that’s the platform that allows enterprises to then run watson, too (which itself runs on containers, too). right now, the focus of this fire launch is on watson assistant and watson openscale. “the capabilities we are releasing right now are based on our two flagship products. that addresses a very large domain of use cases that we come across,” said puri. “in the remaining part of the year, we will bring the rest of the capabilities [to the platform]. for example, watson knowledge studio will come along with it as well, as well as watson’s natural language understanding capabilities that we currently have available in our public cloud environment will be ported on to it as well.” with that, puri argues, ibm will offer enterprises a full spectrum of tools for developing and running ai models using structured and unstructured data, as well as a full monitoring and life cycle management suite. in addition to this, ibm also today announced that it is launching a new version of its watson machine learning accelerator that brings high-performance gpu clustering to power systems and x86 systems and which promises to accelerate ai performance up to 10x. the company also today announced ibm business automation intelligence with watson, though it didn’t quite delve into the details. this new service, the company says, will give business leaders the ability “to apply ai directly to applications, strengthening the workforce, from clerical to knowledge workers, to intelligently automate work from the mundane to the complex.” i’m not really sure what that means, but i’m sure the business leaders who buy this service will figure it out."
"uber is in negotiations with investors, including the softbank vision fund, to secure an investment as large as $1 billion for its autonomous vehicles unit. the deal would value the business at between $5 billion and $10 billion, according to a tuesday report from the wall street journal. uber declined to comment. the news comes shortly after techcrunch’s mark harris revealed the ridehailing firm was burning through $20 million a month on developing self-driving technologies, which means, according to our calculations, that uber could have spent more than $900 million on automated vehicle research since early 2015. according to the wsj, the deal could close as soon as next month, shortly before uber is expected to complete a highly-anticipated initial public offering. uber, in december, filed the necessary paperwork with the us securities and exchange commission to go public in 2019. the documents were submitted only hours after its competitor lyft did the same; lyft, for its part, unveiled its s-1 earlier this month and will debut on the nasdaq shortly. uber, to date, has raised nearly $20 billion in a combination of debt and equity funding, reaching a valuation north of $70 billion. the business is said to be seeking funding for its self-driving business in order to tout the unit’s growth and valuation. after all, a $10 billion sticker price on its av efforts may bandage its reputation, damaged by continued reports questioning its progress. alphabet-owned waymo, meanwhile, is reportedly looking to raise capital, too. this would be the first infusion of outside funding for the autonomous vehicle business, rolled out of alphabet’s google x. according to the information, which broke this news on monday, waymo would raise capital at a valuation “several times” that of cruise, the av company owned by general motors. raising capital from outside investors would help limit costs and would allow alphabet the opportunity to display waymo’s valuation for the first time in several years. alphabet, however, does not want to relinquish too much equity in the business, justifiably. waymo, years ago, was valued at $4.5 billion, though analysts claim it could surpass a valuation as high as $175 billion based on future revenue estimates. waymo didn’t respond to a request for comment. other investors in uber’s purported round include an “unnamed automaker,” per the wsj. uber’s existing backers include toyota, softbank, t. rowe price, fidelity and tpg growth. uber’s net losses were up 32 percent quarter-over-quarter as of late last year to $939 million on a pro forma basis. on an ebitda basis, uber’s losses were $527 million, up about 21 percent. the company said revenue was up five percent qoq sitting at $2.95 billion and up 38 percent year-over-year. report: google’s waymo seeks outside investment and a sky-high valuation"
"several weeks after a sudden shutdown left customers and vendors in the lurch, meal-kit service munchery has filed for bankruptcy. in the chapter 11 filing, munchery chief executive officer james beriker cites increased competition, over-funding, aggressive expansion efforts and blue apron’s failed ipo as reasons for its demise. munchery owes $3 million in unfulfilled customer gift cards and another $3 million to its vendors, suppliers and various counterparties, the filing reveals. the company’s remaining debt includes $5.3 million in senior secured debt and convertible debt of approximately $23 million. munchery says its scrounged up $5 million from a buyer of its equipment, machinery and san francisco headquarters. the business had raised more than $100 million in venture capital funding, reaching a valuation of $300 million in 2015 before ceasing operations on january 22 and laying off 257 employees in the process. munchery was backed by menlo ventures, sherpa capital, e.ventures, cota capital and others. the company, which failed to notify its vendors it was going out of business, has been scrutinized for failing to pay those vendors in the wake of its shutdown. to make matters worse, emails viewed by techcrunch show munchery continued aggressively marketing its gift cards in emails sent to customers in december, weeks before a final email to those very same customers announced it was ceasing operations, effectively immediately. an email advertising munchery gift cards sent to a customer weeks before the startup went out of business. the latest court filings shed light on beriker’s decision-making process in those final months, touching on munchery’s frequent pivots, the company’s 2017 layoffs, its plans to scale sales of munchery products in amazon go stores and failed attempts at a sale. beriker is the sole remaining munchery board member. he has not responded to several requests for comment from techcrunch. in the third quarter of 2018, munchery, at the recommendation of its board, hired an investment bank to find a buyer for the startup, to no avail. beriker suggests the lack of a buyer, coupled with industry trends like larger-than-necessary venture capital rounds and inflated valuations, were cause for the startup’s failure to deliver. “the company expanded too aggressively in its early years,” the filing states. “the access to significant amounts of capital from leading silicon valley venture capital firms at high valuations and low-cost debt from banks and venture debt firms, combined with the perception that the on-demand food delivery market was expanding quickly and would be dominated by one or two brands– as uber had dominated the ridesharing market– drove the company to aggressively invest in its business ahead of having a well-established and scalable business model.” increased competition from well-funded competitors drove the startup off course, too, and the epic failure that was blue apron’s ipo, which had a “material negative impact on access to financing for startups in the online food delivery business,” was just the cherry on top, according to beriker’s statements. former munchery vendors protested today at @sherpa, one of the startup’s investors that’ve stayed silent as former employees, vendors and drivers claim to be owed thousands: “startup idea don’t steal pies!” photo by @threebabesbake pic.twitter.com/kfaoz9cfkq — kate clark (@kateclarktweets) january 30, 2019 munchery’s vendors, who were not notified or paid following munchery’s announcement, have provided outspoken criticism to the company and venture capital’s lack of accountability in the weeks following munchery’s shutdown. lenore estrada of three babes bakeshop, among several vendors owed thousands of dollars in unpaid invoices, orchestrated a protest outside of munchery investor sherpa capital’s offices in january. she said she has spoken with beriker and founding munchery cto conrad chu in an attempt to pick up the pieces of the failed startup puzzle. “none of us who are owed money are going to get anything,” estrada told techcrunch earlier today. “but [beriker], after fucking it all up, is still getting paid.” beriker, indeed, is still earning a salary of $18,750 per month, one-half of his pre-bankruptcy salary, as well as a “success fee based on the net proceeds recovered from the sale of the company’s assets up to a maximum of $250,000,” the filing states. view the full bankruptcy filing here: after an abrupt shutdown, munchery’s small business vendors are the ones picking up the bill"
"at a time when the gig economy is under heavy scrutiny around its practices of classifying workers as 1099 independent contractors, ipo-bound uber has officially settled a six-year-long case regarding this exact topic. today, uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle the class-action lawsuit, brought forth by douglas o’connor and thomas colopy way back in 2013. this comes after a judge rejected uber’s offer to settle for $100 million back in 2016. the suit claimed uber classified its drivers as contractors to avoid paying them a minimum wage and providing benefits. since its original filing, the suit was granted class-action status to represent hundreds of thousands of drivers in california and massachusetts. that victory for drivers was short-lived when an appeals court ruled uber’s arbitration agreements were valid and enforceable. that decision reduced the number of drivers in the class to about 13,600. those eligible for a payout from the settlement include those who drove for uber between august 16, 2009, and february 28, 2019, in california or massachusetts. they must also not be bound by uber’s arbitration clause. in addition to the $20 million settlement, uber has agreed to implement a comprehensive written deactivation policy, a formal appeals process for certain deactivation decisions and quality courses for drivers. “uber has changed a lot since 2013. we have made the driver experience even better through improvements like in-app tipping, a redesigned driver app and new rewards programs like uber pro,” an uber spokesperson told techcrunch. “we’re pleased to reach a settlement on this matter and we’ll continue working hard to improve the quality, security and dignity of independent work.” but for shannon liss-riordan, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, this is not the end of the issue. while liss-riordan said she’s pleased to have reached a settlement, it’s just for a small number of drivers. “as a result, while we were able to pick up the pieces and achieve this substantial settlement for the drivers not covered by arbitration clauses, other drivers would need to pursue their claims in individual arbitration if they wanted to attempt to recover anything on their claims,” she said in a statement to techcrunch. meanwhile, she’s actively pursuing other cases against gig economy companies that classify their workers as independent contractors.  “we continue to have cases pending against amazon, grubhub, lyft, doordash, postmates, handy and many others that are exploiting their workers through this business model,” she said. “because of arbitration clauses, we are fighting many battles to overcome arbitration, and at the same time, we are also pursuing mass arbitrations against many of these companies.” the case is o’connor v. uber, 13-cv-03826 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california (san francisco). view this document on scribd"
"ride-hailing company lyft plans to file its initial public offering in march, possibly beating rival uber to the milestone. two reports, one from reuters, the other from wsj, indicate lyft plans to list its shares on nasdaq next month. the wsj, citing unnamed sources, reported lyft may make the filing public as early as next week. reuters also reported that the ride-hailing company plans to launch the roadshow for its ipo during the week of march 18. lyft spokeswoman alexandra lamanna said the company is declining comment. lyft and larger rival uber have been moving toward their respective ipos for months now. lyft filed in december a draft registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission for its lpo. lyft did not state the number of shares it expects to offer nor the price range in its confidential filing with the sec. lyft said at the time it expected to make its initial public offering after the sec finishes its review process. lyft was last valued at more than $15 billion, while competitor uber is valued north of $100 billion. uber, of course, is also expected to go public in 2019. lyft selected last year jpmorgan chase & co. as the lead underwriter of its initial public offering, along with credit suisse group and jefferies group. lyft has been aggressively expanding into new u.s. cities, as well as into canada, and pursuing its autonomous vehicle ambitions. lyft has increased its market share in the u.s. to 35 percent. in january 2017, lyft had just 22 percent market share in the united states. lyft has raised $2.9 billion in primary capital since april 2017. in total, lyft has raised $5.1 billion since its inception. this is a developing story."
"standard cognition helps retail stores stand up to jeff bezos’ juggernaut. the $50 million-funded autonomous checkout startup is racing to equip bigger shops with scanless payment technology that lets customers walk out the door without ever stopping at a cashier. while amazon go opens its own 2,000 square foot boutiques, standard cognition is working on outfitting 20,000 square foot and larger drug stores and grocers. that led standard cognition to make its first acquisition, explorer.ai. why would an automated checkout company acquire a self-driving car startup? because whether you’re tracking shoppers or pedestrians, you need sophisticated maps of the real world. the more accurate the machine vision is, the larger the store you can equip. and since standard cognition uses ceiling-based cameras instead of putting them on every shelf like amazon, it’s much cheaper to keep eyes on a bigger space. standard cognition is only just over a year old, but with the backing of y combinator, alexis ohanian and garry tan’s initialized capital, and a fast-moving team of seven co-founders, it believes it can outmaneuver amazon. that means doing whatever it can to leap forward. standard cognition already had in-house mapping technology, but explorer.ai’s team and tech could accelerate its quest to bring even 100,000 sq ft big box supercenters into the automated checkout age. “it’s the wild west — applying cutting-edge, state-of-the-art machine learning research that’s hot off the press. we read papers then implement it weeks after it’s published, putting the ideas out into the wild and making them production-worthy — taking it from state-of-the-art to dumb machines you can kick and they won’t fall over.” says standard cognition co-founder and ceo jordan fisher. “it’s no easy task and the exactness we’re going to require will only increase. having a world-class team of engineers and researchers that can build the next generation version of our mapping is why we’re so excited to have the team joining us.” from av to ac explorer.ai is was founded in 2017 too, and its acquisition so soon is a testament to how hot the autonomous driving and checkout markets are. akshay goel, nagasrikanth kallakuri, and tushar dadlani noticed self-driving vehicle startups were all trying to generate their own maps. they cobbled together data from several providers, built maps specifically for different purposes, and soon had fellow startups trying to throw money at them. they raised just under $1 million from story ventures, early facebook engineer nick heyman and more, growing the team to seven employees. explorer.ai’s co-founders   but eventually explorer.ai realized the bigger players were too cautious to rely on outside maps and it could be years before they’d be comfortable with the idea. “our view is it would take quite a while to become a commercial success in mapping for autonomous vehicles” goel tells me. “most of the companies we were working with in partnerships tried to acquire us from an early stage. should we fundraise more or start looking at the acquisition process?” the team asked itself as its cash dwindled. explorer.ai got a few terms sheets for funding, but weren’t sure they’d be able to go to market fast enough. the founders shopped the startup around “to pretty much everyone” goel says, though they refused to name names when i asked if that included natural acquirers like uber and google’s waymo. but then they took a left turn into retail. “what we saw was that essentially since autonomous checkout has a lot fewer safety issues, [standard cognition] could go to market much faster, and mapping had a large impact on autonomous checkout.” the two companies declined to disclose financial terms of the deal, but fisher tells me “we can definitely say it was a competitive process and we’re excited that we could win the hearts and minds of the explorer team.” they’ll join standard cognition’s 40-plus employees as the work on pilots for us and japanese retail locations. goel adds that “the investors, founders, and team are happy”, implying the payout more than returned the money it’d raised. explorer.ai made self-driving car maps before joining standard cognition the big question standard cognition’s customers are asking are whether autonomous checkout is cost-effective, simple for customers to understand, and won’t let shoplifters destroy their margins. that means minimizing installation fees, perfecting onboarding and instruction, and recognizing the difference between someone putting an item back on the shelf versus into their jacket. the startup believes that done right, human cashiers can be repurposed as concierges that help customers find what they’re looking for and buy more without having to stand in line. standard cognition co-founder and ceo jordan fisher “how do you make this a bulletproof, reproducible system that works as well as a till in a grocery store that no one worries about breaking?” is the challenge fisher and his new compatriots must solve. “amazon is pursuing what we call as shelf-based approach with sensors every few inches on every shelf. what’s not great is the expense, the complexity of the electrical and compute systems . . . this is why you’re seeing autonomous checkout applied to amazon go and not larger whole foods stores. not from a lack of desire from amazon, but because it’s not technologically tenable with the approach that they’re taking. i’m confident they’ll tackle that challenge in the next few years but today they’re limited by their technology.” and so standard cognition is pushing as fast as it can build a lead and brand by giving independent retail stores and chains the firepower to fight off amazon. standard cognition will also have to outcompete fellow autonomous checkout startups like ex-pandora cto will glaser’s grabango, which announced it’d raised $12 million today. grabango now has signed deals with four u.s. retail chains up to 25,000 sq ft in size and has 37 employees. there’s also fellow y combinator startup inokyo with a pop-up shop in mountain view; and trigo vision that has a deal with an israeli grocery chain for more than 200 stores. “i wasn’t thinking we’d do any acquisitions a month ago” fisher reveals. “our goal is not just to deliver autonomous checkout to the world but to do it phenomenally quickly. we’re at the beginning of a space race. two to three years from now, i think this will be potentially as crowded as autonomous vehicles. we’re in the lead today but that’s not enough for us. we need to be light-years ahead to capture as much of the market as we want. [with the explorer.ai acquisition] how many days does this advance us? how much further along on our roadmap for world domination does this bring us? when we sat down, it was tangible, the real progression of the roadmap.”"
"a company using advanced technologies to grow and harvest mealworms (larval beetles) at scale is on track to become one of the venture capital industry’s oddest billion-dollar investments. ÿnsect, (pronounced ‘insect”) is a paris-based producer of insect protein that has just closed on $125 million as the company looks to expand into north america selling bug-based nutrients to fish farms, animal farms and the everyday harvesters of vegetables.  the company isn’t worth $1 billion… yet. but that’s clearly the goal as it bulks up for a global expansion effort. according to the company’s chief executive antoine hubert, a former agronomist turned bug-farm maven, the company grew out of efforts to promote sustainability in the food system and companies across france. “we thought we could make a bigger impact by developing not only education but production,” in the realm of novel proteins for agriculture, hubert says.  because agriculture is a leading producer of carbon dioxide and methane emissions that contribute to global warming, any steps that are taken to reduce those emissions by making supply chains and production more efficient would be good for the environment. “the food system has an impact on greenhouse gas. we decided to develop a proper technology to produce large volumes of proteins at competitive prices,” hubert says.  the company borrows automation and sensing technologies from areas as diverse as automotive manufacturing and data center heating ventilation and cooling and applies it to the cultivation of mealworms. the company actually has 25 patents on the technologies it has deployed and is on track to book more than $70 million in revenue this year. bugs are clearly big business. why mealworms, though? because hubert says they’re the highest-quality insect for pound-for-pound protein production. image courtesy of ÿnsect the company said that it raised this $125 million (€110 million) series c round to scale up production. ÿnsect intends to build the world’s biggest insect farm in amiens metropole, northern france and will begin expanding its presence in the north american market.  the deal, led by astanor ventures with participation from bpifrance, talis capital, idinvest partners, finasucre and compagnie du bois sauvage, is the largest agtech deal to date outside of north america, and should plant a flag for the role of insect cultivation in the animal feedstock and fertilizer market, which is a combined global market of $800 billion. that’s good news for competitors like protix, agriprotein, enviroflight and beta hatch, which are all building insect kingdoms of their own with eyes on the same, massive, global market. in fact, before ÿnsect’s big haul, protix held the title of the venture-backed bug business with the most cash. the company raised $50 million in financing back in 2017 to expand its insect empire. ÿnsect’s bug protein has already found its way into pet and plant food, fish food for aquaculture and other applications, but as demand for sources of high-quality proteins continues to grow alongside a rising global population, the company sees one of its largest opportunities in fish and shellfish farming. “by offering an insect protein alternative to traditional animal and fish-based feed sources, ÿnsect can help offset the growing competition for ocean fish stock required to feed two billion more people by 2050, while alleviating fish, water and soil depletion, as well as agriculture’s staggering 25 percent share of global greenhouse gas emissions,” says hubert. “our goal is simply to give insects back their natural place in the food chain.” it was this ability for ÿnsect to slot itself into the global food chain that attracted talis capital as an investor, according to the firm’s co-founder matus maar. “with the global population expected to grow to nine billion by 2050, current aquaculture and animal feeding practices are unsustainable.” mar said in a statement. “ÿnsect taps into a huge, yet highly inefficient global market by offering a premium and — above all — sustainable insect-derived product through a fully automated, ai-enabled production process.”"
"squad could be the next teen sensation because it makes it easy to do nothing… together. spending time with friends in the modern age often means just being on your phones next to each other, occasionally showing off something funny you found. squad lets you do this even while apart, and that way of punctuating video chat might make it the teen girl “third place” like fortnite is for adolescent boys. with squad, you fire up a video chat with up to six people, but at any time you can screenshare what you’re seeing on your phone instead of showing your face. you can browse memes together, trash talk about dms or private profiles, brainstorm a status update, co-work on a project or get consensus on your tinder swipe. it’s deceptively simple, but remarkably alluring. and it couldn’t have happened until now. how squad screensharing looks squad takes advantage of apple’s replaykit for screensharing. while it was announced in 2015, it wasn’t until june 2018’s ios 12 that replaykit became stable and easy enough to be built into a consumer app for teens. meanwhile, plus-size screens and speedy lte and upcoming 5g networks make screensharing watchable. and with instagram aging and snapchat shrinking, there’s demand for a more intimately connected social network. squad only launched its app last week, but droves of facebook and snap employees have signed up to spy on and likely copy the startup, co-founder and ceo esther crawford tells me. screensharing would fit well in group video chat startup houseparty too. to fuel its head start, squad has the $2.2 million it raised before it pivoted away from molly, the team’s previous app where people can make faqs about themselves. that cash came from betaworks, y combinator, bbg ventures, basis set ventures, jesse draper, gary vaynerchuk, niv dror, and [disclosure: former techcrunch editor] alexia bonatsos’ dream machine. next, squad wants to let people tune in to screenshares via url to unlock a new era of live broadcasting, and equip other apps with the capability through a squad sdk. “people under 24 do video chat way different than people 25 and above” says crawford. adding screensharing is “an excuse for hanging out.” serious ideas are preludes to toys screensharing has long been common in enterprise communication apps like webex, zoom and slack. i even called a collaborative browsing and desktop screensharing app my favorite project from facebook’s 2011 college hackathon. but we don’t just use our screens for work any more. teens and young adults live on the digital plane, navigating complex webs of friendships, entertainment and academia through their phones. squad makes those experiences social — including the “social” networks we often scroll through in isolation. charles and ray eames said “toys are preludes to serious ideas,” but this time, it is happening in reverse. squad co-founders from left: ethan sutin, esther crawford “the idea came from a combination of things — a pain we were experiencing as a team,” crawford recalls. my development team is constantly sending each other screenshots and screen recordings. it seemed ridiculous that i can’t just show you what’s on my screen. it was a business use case internally.” but then came the wisdom of a 13-year-old. “my daughter over the summer was bugging me. ‘why can’t i just show what’s on my screen with my friends?’ i said i think it’s not technically possible.” that’s when crawford discovered advances in replaykit meant it suddenly was possible. crawford had already seen this cycle of tool to toy before, as she was an early youtuber. back in the mid-2000s, people thought of youtube as a place to host videos about ebay listings, professional presentations or dating profile supplements. “they couldn’t imagine that if you let people just reliably and easily upload video content, there’d be all these creative enterprises.” use cases for squad after stints in product marketing at coach.com and stride labs, she built estherbot — a chatbot version of herself that let people learn about her. indeed, 50,000 people ended up trying it, convincing her people needed new ways to reveal themselves to friends. she met ethan sutin through the project and together they co-founded faq app molly before it fizzled out and was shut down. “molly wasn’t working; it had high initial engagement sessions, but then they would drop off. maybe it’s not the right time for the augmented version of you,” noted crawford. crawford and sutin pivoted molly into squad to keep exploring new formats for vulnerability. “what excited ethan and i was this mission to help people feel less lonely.” alone, together squad recommends apps to screenshare squad worked, thanks to a slick way to activate screensharing. the app launches to the selfie camera similar to snapchat, but with a + button for inviting friends to a video call. tap the screenshare button at the bottom, select squad and start the broadcast. to guide users toward the best screensharing experiences, a menu of apps emerges encouraging users to open instagram, tiktok, bumble, their camera roll and others. people can bounce back and forth between screensharing and video chat, and tap a friend’s window to view it full-screen. and when they want another friend to see what they’re seeing, squad goes viral. one concern is that squad breaks privacy controls. you could have friends show you someone’s instagram profile you’re blocked by or aren’t allowed to see. but the same goes for hanging out in person, and this is one reason squad doesn’t let you download videos of your chats and is considering screenshot warnings. what’s so special about squad is that it lacks the intensity of traditional video chat, where you constantly feel pressured to perform. you can fire up a chat room, and then go back to phoning as you please with your screen displayed instead of your blank face (though the android version in beta offers picture-in-picture so you can show your mug and the screen). “there’s no picture-in-picture on ios, but younger users don’t even really care. i can point it at the bed and you can tell me when there’s something to look at,” crawford tells me. a few people, alone in their houses, video chatting without looking at each other, still feel a sense of togetherness. the future of squad could grant that feeling to a massive audience of a celebrity or influencer. the startup is working on shareable urls that creators could post on other social networks like twitter or facebook that their fans could click to watch. tagging along as kylie jenner or ninja play around on their phone could bring people closer to their heroes while serving as a massive growth opportunity for squad. similarly, colonizing other apps with an sdk for screensharing could allow squad to recruit their users. squad makes starting a screenshare easy the startup will face stiff technical challenges. lag or low video quality destroy the feeling of delight it delivers, crawford admits, so the team is focused on making sure the app works well even in rural areas like middle america where many early users live. but the real test will be whether it can build a new social graph upon the screensharing idea if already popular apps build competing features. gaming tools like discord and twitch already offer web screensharing, and i suggested facebook should bring the feature to messenger when in late-2017 it launched in its workplace office collaboration app. helping a friend choose when to swipe right on tinder via squad in june i wrote that instagram and snapchat would try to steal the voice-activated visual effects at the center of an app called panda. snapchat started testing those just two months later. instagram’s whole stories feature was cloned from snapchat, and it also cribbed q&a stories from polly. overshadowed, panda and polly have faded from the spotlight. with facebook and snap already sniffing around squad, it’s quite possible they’ll try to copy it. squad will have to hope first-mover advantage and focus can defeat a screensharing feature bolted on to apps with hundreds of millions or even billions of users. but regardless of who delivers this next phase of sharing, it’s coming. “everyone knows that the content flooding our feeds is a filtered version of reality. the real and interesting stuff goes down in dms because people are more authentic when they’re 1:1 or in small group conversations,” crawford wrote. perhaps there’s no better antidote to the poison of social media success theater that revealing that beyond the instagram highlights, we’re often just playing around on our phones. squad might not be glamorous, but it’s authentic and a lot more fun."
"uber, on the heels of lyft’s official documentation for its initial public offering, is expected to file its s-1 in april, reuters reports. uber, in december, filed confidential paperwork for its ipo. uber will also reportedly kick off its ipo roadshow next month. as part of its offering, uber is also expected to reward some of its more active or long-time drivers with a cash award. about a month ago, uber reported $3 billion in q4 2018 revenues with net losses of $865 million. that figure, however, was aided by a tax benefit that saved the company from reporting a $1.2 billion net loss in the period. on an adjusted, pro-forma basis, uber’s net loss in the final quarter of 2018 was a slimmer $768 million. the figures were an improvement of sorts. the firm reported a pro-forma net loss of $939 million in the preceding, third quarter of 2018, but also reported a smaller pre-tax net loss of $971 million. regardless, uber’s stiff losses continued in the quarter. on an annual basis, uber’s revenues came in at $3 billion while losses came in at $1.8 billion for 2018, compared to $2.2 billion in 2017. competitor lyft filed its s-1 earlier this month, reporting $2.2 billion in revenue and nearly $1 billion in losses in 2018. in its s-1, lyft outlined its program to give a maximum cash bonus of $10,000 to drivers “in good standing” who have completed at least 20,000 rides as of february 25, 2019. uber declined to comment on this story."
"short-form video app tiktok has been growing in popularity across international markets, including in the u.s. where a merger with musical.ly has seen the app topping the app store charts. facebook and snapchat have been hastily trying to copy tiktok’s features as a result. a part of tiktok’s ambitious global expansion plan has been its more recent targeting of emerging markets — like india and indonesia — where the company’s quietly launched “tiktok lite” app has been gaining ground in the latter half of 2018. tiktok hasn’t yet made much fuss over its lite version, which actually consists of two separate apps. the first was launched on august 6, 2018 in thailand, but is now available across other primarily asian markets, including indonesia, where it’s most popular, as well as vietnam, malaysia and the philippines. this version of tiktok lite has grown to 5 million installs since its august debut. (it’s actually written with a lowercase “l” in “lite” in the play store, which is how you can tell the difference between this and the other app.) this version was also briefly live in india, brazil and russia, but now these countries are served by a separate lite app (written as “lite” with an uppercase “l”), which launched on november 1, 2018. this second version of tiktok lite has now become the larger of the two, thanks to india. it has around 7.1 million total downloads, according to sensor tower data. it has also now been installed across 15 additional non-asian countries, including egypt, brazil, algeria, tunisia, russia, ecuador, south africa, dominican republic, guatemala, kenya, costa rica, el salvador, nigeria, angola and ghana. combined, the two tiktok lite apps have gained more than 12 million downloads in around six months’ time, techcrunch confirmed with sensor tower. however, tiktok lite is not being heavily promoted at this time — especially when compared with the outsize marketing that tiktok’s flagship app has been seeing as of late. this advertising is courtesy of tiktok’s chinese parent company, bytedance, which has had an infusion of billions in outside capital recently. the company is valued at $78 billion, as of october. and it’s spending, apparently: e.g.: more expensive promotion of #tiktok, this time in #dubai. that 3 billion from #softbank won't last long at this rate #bytedance 🤑🤑🤑 pic.twitter.com/a12tumbghc — matthew brennan (@mbrennanchina) january 1, 2019 sensor tower found that more than half of tiktok lite’s downloads came over the past month, following tiktok lite’s return to india. combined, the two lite apps’ downloads reached around 6.7 million in december, which was a 158 percent increase over november’s 2.6 million installs, it said. despite tiktok lite’s growth, 12 million+ downloads is only a drop in the bucket when it comes to tiktok’s larger user base. this represents only 4.5 percent of tiktok’s downloads on google play since august 2018, and only about 3.6 percent of all tiktok downloads since then across both the ios and google play app stores combined. to date, tiktok’s main app has been downloaded more than 887 million times on google play. that doesn’t count the downloads from the chinese version called douyin, which is found on third-party android app stores. that means tiktok’s true install base is even bigger. bytedance itself had publicly said last july the tiktok user base had grown to 500 million+ monthly active users — a way of counting who’s regularly using the app instead of just installing it on their phone. given that facebook lite grew to 200 million users in less than two years‘ time, it seems like a “lite” version of tiktok, now one of the world’s biggest apps, could be doing a bit better than 12 million installs over a six-month period. the problem seems to stem from a variety of factors, including how tiktok lite is marketed in the play store. the app uses screenshots and a description that make it seem like it’s just another version of tiktok. but according to user reviews, people were disappointed to find it’s a consumption-only app. many have left reviews complaining about how they can’t make videos. they call it “fake” and “bad” as a result. tiktok would do better to clarify how its lite version is different, to eliminate this confusion. it’s common for major tech companies to offer a “lighter” version of their app for emerging markets where low bandwidth is a concern. these apps tend to be smaller in size, more performant and sometimes either have reduced capabilities or special features aimed at low-bandwidth users. google, for example, has a suite of light apps — the “go” edition apps — like gmail go, youtube go, files go, google go, google maps go and google assistant go. uber now offers uber lite. facebook operates apps like facebook lite, messenger lite and instagram lite — the latter which launched just ahead of tiktok lite, in fact. like most “lite” apps, tiktok lite clocks in at a smaller size — it’s only 10mb to 11mb (depending on the version) versus the much larger 71mb of tiktok’s main app. a rep for tiktok confirmed the company is now offering a lite version in some markets so users can choose a smaller app if they have concerns around data or the storage space on their phone. no other information about the lite versions or strategy was provided. so far, bytedance’s efforts around tiktok lite seem more experimental, given it hasn’t put up a proper description on google play, runs two separate lite versions and had offered the app in some markets briefly, pulled out, then returned with another version. it will be interesting to see what tiktok lite becomes when it gets the sort of attention that the main tiktok app is receiving today."
"i’m flying back to the usa today, and as an infrastructure aficionado, it’s nice to be going home, but i’m dreading the disappointment. i just spent two weeks in singapore and thailand; last year i spent time in hong kong and shenzhen; and compared to modern asia, so much american infrastructure is now so contemptible that it’s hard not to wince when i see it. the usa is nine times wealthier than thailand, per capita, but i’d far rather ride bangkok’s skytrain than deal with nyc’s subway nowadays. i’d much prefer to fly into don muang, bangkok’s ancient second-tier airport — which was actually closed for years, before being reopened to handle domestic flights and low-cost airlines — than the hostile nightmare that is lax. and those are america’s two primary gateway cities! so imagine what it’s like coming to america from wealthy asian nations, and their gleaming, polished, metronomically reliable subways, trains, and airports. i don’t think americans understand just how that comparison has become a quiet ongoing national humiliation. if they did, sheer national (and civic) pride would make them want to do something about it. instead there’s a learned helplessness about most american infrastructure nowadays, a wrong but certain belief that it’s unrealistic to dream of anything better. it’s not just those two cities. compare boston’s t to, say, taipei, or san francisco’s mishmash of messed-up systems — muni, where i have waited 45 minutes for a t-third; caltrain, which only runs every 90 minutes on weekends; bart, which squandered millions on its useless white-elephant millbrae station — to shenzhen. and it’s not just age; paris’s metro was inaugurated in 1900, but its well-maintained system continues to run excellently and expand continuously. americans still tend to think of themselves as an example to other nations. ha. i assure you, over the last few years nobody has flown from seoul or taipei or tokyo or singapore or hong kong or shenzhen into newark airport; taken the airtrain to the nj transit station; waited for the rattling, decrepit train into the city; walked through the repellent ugliness of penn station to the subway; waited for its ever-increasing delays; ridden to their destination; and finally emerged into new york city — the nation’s alpha city! — still thinking of the usa as anything other than a counterexample, or maybe a cautionary tale. this goes beyond transport infrastructure. airport security measures are much more sensible in asia. payments are increasingly separately structured, and better, too — in many places, credit cards (which already barely exist as a concept in china) are beginning to slowly wither away, replaced by alipay and to a lesser extent wechat pay. (not least because an ever-growing proportion of the tourist population is chinese rather than western, nowadays.) that’s admittedly an example of leapfrogging, not decay, and american infrastructure does still have some bright spots. american roads are mostly still superb. lyft and uber are much better than their southeast asian equivalent grab, which, whenever i checked it during this latest trip, was invariably both slower and more expensive than a taxi (never mind a tuk-tuk) despite the infamous thai taxi mafias. international mobile connectivity is excellent and user-friendly and reasonably priced, at least if you’re on t-mobile like me, and as an added bonus, due to a technical quirk, mobile data roaming bypasses china’s great firewall. but that doesn’t change the fact that the state of much of america’s infrastructure is appalling on its face, and even moreso when compared to nations which are on paper nowhere near as rich. the money other nations spend on urban infrastructure (don’t even get me started on intercity trains) is instead siphoned off to somewhere else. it makes the usa — still by far the wealthiest country in the world! — seem like a dying empire, one beginning to visibly crack and crumble as it is slowly hollowed out from within. what happened? a cascading series of failures of imagination; failures to invest in the future; paralyzed or ideologically blinkered or simply idiotic governance; and, perhaps most of all, cost disease. (it frequently costs a whopping 4x as much per mile to build a subway in the usa as it costs in, say, paris or seoul. sometimes even more.) what can be done? i’m pretty sure the first step is for americans to believe that something can be done. clearly it can. just look across the pacific."
"uber has fixed a bug that allowed access to the secret developer tokens of apps that integrated with the ridesharing service, according to the security researchers who discovered the flaw. in a blog post, anand prakash and manisha sangwan explained that a vulnerable developer endpoint on uber’s back-end systems — since locked down — was mistakenly spitting back client secrets and server tokens for apps authorized by the uber account owner. client secrets and server tokens are considered highly sensitive bits of information for developers, as they allow apps to communicate with uber’s servers. for its part, uber warns developers to “never share” the keys with anyone. prakash, founder of bangalore-based appsecure, told techcrunch that the bug was “very easy” to exploit, and could have allowed an attacker to obtain trip receipts and invoices. but he didn’t test how far the access could have gone as he immediately reported the bug to uber. uber took a month to fix the bug, according to the disclosure timeline, and was considered serious enough to email developers last week warning of the possible exposure. “at this time, we have no indication that the issue was exploited, but suggest reviewing your application’s practices out of an abundance of caution,” uber’s email to developers said. “we have mitigated the issue by restricting the information returned to the name and id of the authorized applications.” uber did not respond to a request for comment. if that changes, we’ll update. prakash was paid $5,000 in uber’s bug bounty for reporting the bug, and currently ranks in the top five submitters on uber’s bug bounty. the security researcher is no stranger to uber’s bug bounty. two years ago, he found and successfully exploited a bug that allowed him to receive free trips in both the u.s. and his native india. researcher finds bug that allowed free uber rides"
"as she sat in the airport with a one-way ticket in her hand, tiffany filler wondered how she would pick up the pieces of her life, with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt and nothing to show for it. a day earlier, she was expelled from tufts university veterinary school. as a canadian, her visa was no longer valid and she was told by the school to leave the u.s. “as soon as possible.” that night, her plane departed the u.s. for her native toronto, leaving any prospect of her becoming a veterinarian behind. filler, 24, was accused of an elaborate months-long scheme involving stealing and using university logins to break into the student records system, view answers, and alter her own and other students’ grades. the case tufts presented seems compelling, if not entirely believable. there’s just one problem: in almost every instance that the school accused filler of hacking, she was elsewhere with proof of her whereabouts or an eyewitness account and without the laptop she’s accused of using. she has alibis: fellow students who testified to her whereabouts; photos with metadata putting her miles away at the time of the alleged hacks; and a sleep tracker that showed she was asleep during others. tufts is either right or it expelled an innocent student on shoddy evidence four months before she was set to graduate. – – – guilty until proven innocent tiffany filler always wanted to be a vet. ever since she was a teenager, she set her sights on her future career. with almost four years under her belt at tufts, which is regarded as one of the best schools for veterinary medicine in north america, she could have written her ticket to any practice. her friends hold her in high regard, telling me that she is honest and hardworking. she kept her head down, earning cumulative grade point averages of 3.9 for her masters and 3.5 for her doctorate. for a time, she was even featured on the homepage of tufts’ vet school. she was a model final-year student. tufts didn’t see it that way. filler was called into a meeting on the main campus on august 22 where the university told her of an investigation. she had “no idea” about the specifics of the hacking allegations, she told me on a phone call, until october 18 when she was pulled out of her shift, still in her bloodied medical scrubs, to face the accusations from the ethics and grievance committee. for three hours, she faced eight senior academics, including one who is said to be a victim of her alleged hacks. the allegations read like a court docket, but filler said she went in knowing nothing that she could use to defend herself. tufts said she stole a librarian’s password to assign a mysteriously created user account, “scott shaw,” with a higher level of system and network access. filler allegedly used it to look up faculty accounts and reset passwords by swapping out the email address to one she’s accused of controlling, or in some cases obtaining passwords and bypassing the school’s two-factor authentication system by exploiting a loophole that simply didn’t require a second security check, which the school has since fixed. tufts accused filler of using this extensive system access to systematically log in as “scott shaw” to obtain answers for tests, taking the tests under her own account, said to be traced from either her computer — based off a unique identifier, known as a mac address — and the network she allegedly used, either the campus’s wireless network or her off-campus residence. when her grades went up, sometimes other students’ grades went down, the school said. in other cases, she’s alleged to have broken into the accounts of several assessors in order to alter existing grades or post entirely new ones. tiffany filler, left, with her mother in a 2017 photo at tufts university. the bulk of the evidence came from tufts’ it department, which said each incident was “well supported” from log files and database records. the evidence pointed to her computer over a period of several months, the department told the committee. “i thought due process was going to be followed,” said filler, in a call. “i thought it was innocent until proven guilty until i was told ‘you’re guilty unless you can prove it.'” like any private university, tufts can discipline — even expel — a student for almost any reason. “universities can operate like shadow criminal justice systems — without any of the protections or powers of a criminal court,” said samantha harris, vice president of policy research at fire, a rights group for america’s colleges and universities. “they’re without any of the due process protections for someone accused of something serious, and without any of the powers like subpoenas that you’d need to gather all of the technical evidence.” students face an uphill battle in defense of any charges of wrongdoing. as was the case with filler, many students aren’t given time to prepare for hearings, have no right to an attorney, and are not given any or all of the evidence. some of the broader charges, such as professional misconduct or ethical violations, are even harder to fight. grade hacking is one such example — and one of the most serious offenses in academia. where students have been expelled, many have also faced prosecution and the prospect of serving time in prison on federal computer hacking charges. harris reviewed documents we provided outlining the university’s allegations and filler’s appeal. “it’s troubling when i read her appeal,” said harris. “it looks as though [the school has] a lot of information in their sole possession that she might try to use to prove her innocent, and she wasn’t given access to that evidence.” access to the university’s evidence, she said, was “critical” to due process protections that students should be given, especially when facing suspension or expulsion. a month later, the committee served a unanimous vote that filler was the hacker and recommended her expulsion. – – – a rat in the room what few facts filler and tufts could agree on is that there almost certainly was a hacker. they just disagreed on who the hacker was. struggling for answers and convinced her macbook air — the source of the alleged hacks — was itself compromised, she paid for someone through freelance marketplace fiverr to scan her computer. within minutes, several malicious files were found, chief among which were two remote access trojans — or rats — commonly used by jilted or jealous lovers to spy on their exes’ webcams and remotely control their computers over the internet. the scan found two: coldroot and crossrat. the former is easily deployed, and the other is highly advanced malware, said to be linked to the lebanese government. evidence of a rat might suggest someone had remote control of her computer without her knowledge. but existence of both on the same machine, experts say, is unlikely if not entirely implausible. thomas reed, director of mac and mobile at malwarebytes, the same software used to scan filler’s computer, confirmed the detections but said there was no conclusive evidence to show the malware was functional. “the coldroot infection was just the app and was missing the launch daemon that would have been key to keeping it running,” said reed. even if it were functional, how could the hacker have framed her? could filler have paid someone to hack her grades? if she paid someone to hack her grades, why implicate her — and potentially the hacker — by using her computer? filler said she was not cautious about her own cybersecurity — insofar that she pinned her password to a corkboard in her room. could this have been a stitch-up? was someone in her house trying to frame her? the landlord told me a staff resident at tufts veterinary school, who has since left the house, “has bad feelings” and “anger” toward filler. the former housemate may have motive but no discernible means. we reached out to the former housemate for comment but did not hear back, and therefore are not naming the person. filler took her computer to an apple store, claiming the “mouse was acting on its own and the green light for the camera started turning on,” she said. the support staff backed up her files but wiped her computer, along with any evidence of malicious software beyond a handful of screenshots she took as part of the dossier of evidence she submitted in her appeal. it didn’t convince the grievance committee of possible malicious interference. “feedback from [it] indicated that these issues with her computer were in no way related to the alleged allegations,” said angie warner, the committee’s acting chair, in an email we’ve seen, recommending filler’s expulsion. citing an unnamed it staffer, the department claimed with “high degree of certainty” that it was “highly unlikely” that the grade changes were “performed by malicious software or persons without detailed and extensive hacking ability.” unable to prove who was behind the remote access malware — or even if it was active — she turned back to fighting her defense. – – – ‘why wait?’ it took more than a month before filler would get the specific times of the alleged hacks, revealing down to the second when each breach happened filler thought she could convince the committee that she wasn’t the hacker, but later learned that the timings “did not factor” into the deliberations of the grievance committee, wrote tufts’ veterinary school dean joyce knoll in an email dated december 21. but filler said she could in all but a handful of cases provide evidence showing that she was not at her computer. in one of the first allegations of hacking, filler was in a packed lecture room, with her laptop open, surrounded by her fellow vet school colleagues both besides and behind her. we spoke to several students who knew filler — none wanted to be named for fear of retribution from tufts — who wrote letters to testify in filler’s defense. all of the students we spoke to said they were never approached by tufts to confirm or scrutinize their accounts. two other classmates who saw filler’s computer screen during the lecture told me they saw nothing suspicious — only her email or the lecture slides. another time filler is accused of hacking, she was on rounds with other doctors, residents and students to discuss patients in their care. one student said filler was “with the entire rotation group and the residents, without any access to a computer” for two hours. for another accusation, filler was out for dinner in a neighboring town. “she did not have her laptop with her,” said one of the fellow student who was with filler at dinner. the other students sent letters to tufts in her defense. tufts said on that occasion, her computer — eight miles away from the restaurant — was allegedly used to access another staff member’s login and tried to bypass the two-factor authentication, using an iphone 5s, a model filler doesn’t own. filler has an iphone 6. (we asked an it systems administrator at another company about duo audit logs: they said if a device not enrolled with duo tried to enter a valid username and password but couldn’t get past the two-factor prompt, the administrator would only see the device’s software version and not see the device type. a duo spokesperson confirmed that the system does not collect device names.) filler, who wears a xiaomi fitness and sleep tracker, said the tracker’s records showed she was asleep in most, but not all of the times she’s accused of hacking. she allowed techcrunch to access the data in her cloud-stored account, which confirmed her accounts. the list of accusations included a flurry of activity from her computer at her residence, tufts said took place between 1am and 2am on june 27, 2018 — during which her fitness tracker shows she was asleep — and from 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on june 28, 2018. but filler was 70 miles away visiting the mark twain house in neighboring hartford, connecticut. she took two photos of her visit — one of her in the house, and another of her standing outside. we asked jake williams, a former nsa hacker who founded cybersecurity and digital forensics firm rendition infosec, to examine the metadata embedded in the photos. the photos, taken from her iphone, contained a matching date and time for the alleged hack, as well as a set of coordinates putting her at the mark twain house. while photo metadata can be modified, williams said the signs he expected to see for metadata modification weren’t there. “there is no evidence that these were modified,” he said. yet none of it was good enough to keep her enrolled at tufts. in a letter on january 16 affirming her expulsion, knoll rejected the evidence. “date stamps are easy to edit,” said knoll. “in fact, the photos you shared with me clearly include an ‘edit’ button in the upper corner for this exact purpose,” she wrote, referring to the iphone software’s native photo editing feature. “why wait until after you’d been informed that you were going to be expelled to show me months’ old photos?” she said. “my decision is final,” said her letter. filler was expelled. filler’s final expulsion letter. (image: supplied) – – – the little things filler is back home in toronto. as her class is preparing to graduate without her in may, tufts has already emailed her to begin reclaiming her loans. news of filler’s expulsion was not unexpected given the drawn-out length of the investigation, but many were stunned by the result, according to the students we spoke to. from the time of the initial investigation, many believed filler would not escape the trap of “guilty until proven innocent.” “i do not believe tiffany received fair treatment,” said one student. “as a private institution, it seems like we have few protections [or] ways of recourse. if they could do this to tiffany, they could do it to any of us.” techcrunch sent tufts a list of 19 questions prior to publication — including if the university hired qualified forensics specialists to investigate, and if law enforcement was contacted and whether the school plans to press criminal charges for the alleged hacking. “due to student privacy concerns, we are not able to discuss disciplinary matters involving any current or former student of cummings school of veterinary medicine at tufts university,” said tara pettinato, a tufts spokesperson. “we take seriously our responsibility to ensure our students’ privacy, to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity, and to adhere to our policies and processes, which are designed to be fair and equitable to all students.” we asked if the university would answer our questions if filler waived her right to privacy. the spokesperson said the school “is obligated to follow federal law and its own standards and practices relating to privacy,” and would not discuss disciplinary matters involving any current or former student. the spokesperson declined to comment further. but even the little things don’t add up. tufts never said how it obtained her ip address. her landlord told me tufts never asked for it, let alone confirmed it was accurate. courts have thrown out cases that rely on them as evidence when others share the same network. mac addresses can identify devices but can be easily spoofed. filler owns an iphone 6, not an iphone 5s, as claimed by tufts. and her computer name was different to what tufts said. and how did she allegedly get access to the “scott shaw” password in the first place? warner, the committee chair, said in a letter that the school “does not know” how the initial librarian’s account was compromised, and that it was “irrelevant” if filler even created the “scott shaw” account. many accounts were breached as part of this apparent elaborate scheme to alter grades, but there is no evidence tufts hired any forensics experts to investigate. did the it department investigate with an inherent confirmation bias to try to find evidence that connected filler’s account with the suspicious activity, or were the allegations constructed after filler was identified as a suspect? and why did the university take months from the first alleged hack to move to protect user accounts with two-factor authentication, and not sooner? “the data they are looking at doesn’t support the conclusions they’ve drawn,” said williams, following his analysis of the case. “it’s entirely possible that the data they’re relying on — is far from normal or necessary burdens of evidence that you would use for an adverse action like this. “they did diy forensics,” he continued. “and they opened themselves up to legal exposure by doing the investigation themselves.” not every story has a clear ending. this is one of them. as much as you would want answers reading this far into the story, we do, too. but we know two things for certain. first, tufts expelled a student months before she was set to graduate based on a broken system of academic-led, non-technical committees forced to rely on weak evidence from it technicians who had no discernible qualifications in digital forensics. and second, it doesn’t have to say why. or as one student said: “we got her side of the story, and tufts was not transparent.” extra crunch members — join our conference call on tuesday, march 12 at 11am pst / 2pm est with host zack whittaker. he’ll discuss the story’s developments and take your questions. not a member yet? learn more about extra crunch and try it free. read more on techcrunch: two hackers behind 2016 uber data breach have been indicted for another hack millions of bank loan and mortgage documents have leaked online hackers are spreading islamic state propaganda by hijacking twitter accounts many popular iphone apps secretly record your screen without asking dow jones’ watchlist of 2.4 million high-risk individuals has leaked india’s state gas company leaks millions of aadhaar numbers"
"security researchers have found dozens of companies inadvertently leaking sensitive corporate and customer data because staff are sharing public links to files in their box enterprise storage accounts that can easily be discovered. the discoveries were made by adversis, a cybersecurity firm, which found major tech companies and corporate giants had left data inadvertently exposed. although data stored in box enterprise accounts is private by default, users can share files and folders with anyone, making data publicly accessible with a single link. but adversis said these secret links can be discovered by others. using a script to scan for and enumerate box accounts with lists of company names and wildcard searches, adversis found more than 90 companies with publicly accessible folders. not even box’s own staff were immune from leaking data. the company said while much of the data is legitimately public and box advises users how to minimize risks, many employees may not know the sensitive data they share can be found by others. worse, some public folders were scraped and indexed by search engines, making the data found more easily. in a blog post, adversis said box administrators should reconfigure the default access for shared links to “people in your company” to reduce accidental exposure of data to the public. adversis said it found passport photos, bank account and social security numbers, passwords, employee lists, financial data like invoices and receipts and customer data among the data found. the company contacted box to warn of the larger exposures of sensitive data, but noted that there was little overall improvement six months after its initial disclosure. “there is simply too much out there and not enough time to resolve each individually,” he said. adversis provided techcrunch with a list of known exposed box accounts. we contacted several of the big companies named, as well as those known to have highly sensitive data, including: amadeus, the flight reservation system maker, which left a folder full of documents and application files associated with singapore airlines. earlier this year, researchers found flaws that made it easy to change reservations booked with amadeus. apple had several folders exposed, containing what appeared to be non-sensitive internal data, such as logs and regional price lists. television network discovery had more than a dozen folders listed, including database dumps of millions of customers names and email addresses. the folders also contained some demographic information and developer project files, including casting contracts and notes and tax documents. edelman, the global public relations firm, had an entire project proposal for working with the new york city mass transit division, including detailed proposal plans and more than a dozen resumes of potential staff for the project — including their names, email addresses, and phone numbers. nutrition giant herbalife left several folders exposed containing files and spreadsheets on about 100,000 customers, including their names, email addresses and phone numbers. opportunity international, a nonprofit aimed at ending global poverty, exposed in a massive spreadsheet a list of donor names, addresses and amount given. schneider electric left dozens of customer orders accessible to anyone, including sludge works and pump stations for several towns and cities. each folder had an installation “sequence of operation” document, which included both default passwords and in some cases “backdoor” access passwords in case of forgotten passwords. pointcare, a medical insurance coverage management software company, had thousands of patient names and insurance information exposed. some of the data included the last four digits of social security numbers. united tissue network, a whole-body donation nonprofit, exposed body donor information and personal information of donors in a vast spreadsheet, including the prices of body parts. box, which initially had no comment when we reached out, had several folders exposed. the company exposed signed non-disclosure agreements on their clients, including several u.s. schools, as well as performance metrics of its own staff, the researchers said. box spokesperson denis roy said in a statement: “we take our customers’ security seriously and we provide controls that allow our customers to choose the right level of security based on the sensitivity of the content they are sharing. in some cases, users may want to share files or folders broadly and will set the permissions for a custom or shared link to public or ‘open’. we are taking steps to make these settings more clear, better help users understand how their files or folders can be shared, and reduce the potential for content to be shared unintentionally, including both improving admin policies and introducing additional controls for shared links.” the cloud giant said it plans to reduce the unintended discovery of public files and folders. amadeus, apple, box, discovery, herbalife, edelman and pointcare all reconfigured their enterprise accounts to prevent access to their leaking files after techcrunch reached out. amadeus spokesperson alba redondo said the company decommissioned box in october and blamed the exposure on an account that was “misconfigured in public mode,” which has now been corrected and external access to it is now closed. “we continue to investigate this issue and confirm there has been no unauthorized access of our system,” said the spokesperson, without explanation. “there is no evidence that confidential information or any information containing personal data was impacted by this issue,” the spokesperson added. when we asked amadeus how it concluded there was no improper access, another spokesperson, ben hunt, said: “we have the full audit trail for box and access of these files — none of the files have been downloaded outside of either amadeus or authorized customers.” the spokesperson declined to explain its statement when told files were downloaded to verify their contents. pointcare chief executive everett lebherz confirmed its leaking files had been “removed and box settings adjusted.” edelman’s global marketing chief michael bush said the company was “looking into this matter.” herbalife spokesperson jennifer butler said the company was “looking into it,” but we did not hear back after several follow-ups. (butler declared her email “off the record,” which requires both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were given no opportunity to reject the terms.) when reached, an apple spokesperson did not comment by the time of publication. discovery, opportunity international, schneider electric and united tissue network did not return a request for comment. data “dumpster diving” is not a new hobby for the skilled, but it’s a necessary sub-industry to fix an emerging category of data breaches: leaking, public and exposed data that shouldn’t be. it’s a growing space that we predicted would grow as more security researchers look to find and report data leaks. this year alone, we’ve reported data leaks at dow jones, rubrik, nasa, aiesec, uber, the state bank of india, two massive batches of indian aadhaar numbers, a huge leak of mortgage and loan data and several chinese government surveillance systems. adversis has open-sourced and published its scanning tool. here’s what to expect in cybersecurity in 2019"
"sibjeet mahapatra contributor share on twitter sib mahapatra is a writer and co-founder of bureau, an end-to-end office furniture startup in nyc. more posts by this contributor vr, presence and the case of the missing killer app the bull case for snapchat when considering the structural impact of technology companies on our economy and society, we tend to focus on questions of scale and monopoly. it’s true that the faang companies and more recent winners (airbnb, uber) have surfed a combination of network effects, preferential access to capital and classic efficiencies of scale to generate tremendous value for their shareholders — to the detriment of new entrants who attempt to unseat them. at their high water mark in mid-2018, faang alone made up 11 percent of the total market cap of the s&p 500 and 38 percent of the index’s year-to-date gain, representing a doubling in their influence in only five years. the question of regulating technology companies — to the point of instituting anti-trust actions — has even become a rare point of relative concord between democrats and republicans in congress. but is the narrative of tech companies in the 2010s only a story of economic consolidation and growing inequality? many of the most successful b2b startups of the last decade are aligned by a theme that paints a different picture. by transforming the nature of the costs required to start a business, these startups are reducing the influence of capital and leveling the playing field for new entrants to share in the surplus generated by the secular shift to a tech-mediated economy. source: getty images/mikiekwoods a path to equal opportunity: turning fixed costs into variable costs what do aws, wework, stord, gusto and rocketlawyer have in common? they provide cloud computing services, office space, warehouse storage, payroll management and access to legal templates, respectively — at first glance, not a particularly congruent set of services. but they are alike in the economic purpose they serve for their customers. each of these services takes a fixed cost — a bank of servers, a lease, a legal retainer — and transforms it into a variable cost. as a refresher, a fixed cost stays constant regardless of output, and variable costs scale with the output of a business. when my father started his software consulting business in the early 1990s, i remember the giant boxes of aix servers that arrived at our apartment, and tagging along to office tours in central new jersey before he decided to run the company out of our spare bedroom. back then, starting almost any kind of business was hard because of high fixed costs. without aws or wework, you shelled out upfront for hardware and a lease. access to capital, whether in the form of a bank loan, savings or friends and family was a prerequisite for entrepreneurship. today, startups make it possible to start and scale almost any kind of business while incurring few fixed costs. want to found an e-commerce store? start with a free shopify account and dropship your inventory. want to become a freelance designer? put a shingle up on fiverr and meet clients at a breather you rent by the hour. whether software or hardware or labor, building a business is way easier when overhead is transformed into a string of flexible microservices that you only pay for as you grow. image courtesy of getty images lower fixed costs means capital matters less taken together, startups that turn fixed costs into variable costs make it less capital-intensive to start a business. this decreases the influence of gatekeepers and aggregators of capital — an impact evident in the way entrepreneurs think about starting businesses today. it’s no coincidence that the rise of b2b startups fitting this theme has coincided with the bootstrap movement, in which tech entrepreneurs with major ambitions demur from raising venture funding because — well, they don’t need the money anymore. it has also coincided with a renaissance in freelance entrepreneurship: 56.7 million americans freelanced in 2018. beyond the economic benefits of working for yourself — the fastest growing segment of freelancers earns more than $75,000 a year — freelancers can access the lifestyle and health benefits of owning their destiny, which aren’t directly captured but play a role in the economic picture. indeed, 51 percent of freelancers said no amount of money would lure them into a traditional job, and 64 percent reported feeling healthier and happier. when capital plays a reduced role in new business formation, access to capital plays a smaller role in determining who will succeed. more companies are founded, and the economy becomes more likely to birth new davids that will unseat the goliaths. economics 101: lower barriers to entry create markets that converge on perfect competition instead of oligarchic concentration. source: getty images/erhui1979 variable costs don’t scale, but that’s ok variable costs have their downsides. a startup with a relatively higher proportion of fixed costs — the profile of the classic high-tech software business — can achieve higher profit margins as it scales. compare microsoft or google, which pay high fixed costs in the form of salaries and servers but few costs in delivering their services and achieve operating margins of 25-30 percent, to costco, which takes in more than $100 billion of annual revenue but earns an operating margin in the single digits. that’s ok. neither type of cost is “better” or “worse,” but having the option to decide how to structure costs through a company’s life cycle can meaningfully impact an entrepreneur’s ability to execute a business idea. founders investigating startup ideas — and politicians debating the impact of technology — would do well to pay attention to how b2b companies have democratized access to entrepreneurship. equality of outcome arrives from equality of opportunity — and a future where millions of people can start businesses, differentiate and succeed on the basis of their ability and value proposition, rather than their access to capital, sounds like a promising representation of the egalitarian ethos silicon valley wants to bring to pass."
"“if ai is so easy, why isn’t there any in this room?” asks ali farhadi, founder and ceo of xnor, gesturing around the conference room overlooking lake union in seattle. and it’s true — despite a handful of displays, phones and other gadgets, the only things really capable of doing any kind of ai-type work are the phones each of us have set on the table. yet we are always hearing about how ai is so accessible now, so flexible, so ubiquitous. and in many cases, even those devices that can aren’t employing machine learning techniques themselves, but rather sending data off to the cloud where it can be done more efficiently. because the processes that make up “ai” are often resource-intensive, sucking up cpu time and battery power. that’s the problem xnor aimed to solve, or at least mitigate, when it spun off from the allen institute for artificial intelligence in 2017. its breakthrough was to make the execution of deep learning models on edge devices so efficient that a $5 raspberry pi zero could perform state of the art computer vision processes nearly as well as a supercomputer. the team achieved that, and xnor’s hyper-efficient ml models are now integrated into a variety of devices and businesses. as a follow-up, the team set their sights higher — or lower, depending on your perspective. answering his own question on the dearth of ai-enabled devices, farhadi pointed to the battery pack in the demo gadget they made to show off the pi zero platform and explained: “this thing right here. power.” power was the bottleneck they overcame to get ai onto cpu- and power-limited devices like phones and the pi zero. so the team came up with a crazy goal: why not make an ai platform that doesn’t need a battery at all? less than a year later, they’d done it. that thing right there performs a serious computer vision task in real time: it can detect in a fraction of a second whether and where a person, or car, or bird, or whatever, is in its field of view, and relay that information wirelessly. and it does this using the kind of power usually associated with solar-powered calculators. the device farhadi and hardware engineering head saman naderiparizi showed me is very simple — and necessarily so. a tiny camera with a 320×240 resolution, an fpga loaded with the object recognition model, a bit of memory to handle the image and camera software and a small solar cell. a very simple wireless setup lets it send and receive data at a very modest rate. “this thing has no power. it’s a two-dollar computer with an uber-crappy camera, and it can run state of the art object recognition,” enthused farhadi, clearly more than pleased with what the xnor team has created. for reference, this video from the company’s debut shows the kind of work it’s doing inside: as long as the cell is in any kind of significant light, it will power the image processor and object recognition algorithm. it needs about a hundred millivolts coming in to work, though at lower levels it could just snap images less often. it can run on that current alone, but of course it’s impractical to not have some kind of energy storage; to that end this demo device has a supercapacitor that stores enough energy to keep it going all night, or just when its light source is obscured. as a demonstration of its efficiency, let’s say you did decide to equip it with, say, a watch battery. naderiparizi said it could probably run on that at one frame per second for more than 30 years. not a product of course the breakthrough isn’t really that there’s now a solar-powered smart camera. that could be useful, sure, but it’s not really what’s worth crowing about here. it’s the fact that a sophisticated deep learning model can run on a computer that costs pennies and uses less power than your phone does when it’s asleep. “this isn’t a product,” farhadi said of the tiny hardware platform. “it’s an enabler.” the energy necessary for performing inference processes such as facial recognition, natural language processing and so on put hard limits on what can be done with them. a smart light bulb that turns on when you ask it to isn’t really a smart light bulb. it’s a board in a light bulb enclosure that relays your voice to a hub and probably a data center somewhere, which analyzes what you say and returns a result, turning the light on. that’s not only convoluted, but it introduces latency and a whole spectrum of places where the process could break or be attacked. and meanwhile it requires a constant source of power or a battery! on the other hand, imagine a camera you stick into a house plant’s pot, or stick to a wall, or set on top of the bookcase, or anything. this camera requires no more power than some light shining on it; it can recognize voice commands and analyze imagery without touching the cloud at all; it can’t really be hacked because it barely has an input at all; and its components cost maybe $10. only one of these things can be truly ubiquitous. only the latter can scale to billions of devices without requiring immense investment in infrastructure. and honestly, the latter sounds like a better bet for a ton of applications where there’s a question of privacy or latency. would you rather have a baby monitor that streams its images to a cloud server where it’s monitored for movement? or a baby monitor that absent an internet connection can still tell you if the kid is up and about? if they both work pretty well, the latter seems like the obvious choice. and that’s the case for numerous consumer applications. amazingly, the power cost of the platform isn’t anywhere near bottoming out. the fpga used to do the computing on this demo unit isn’t particularly efficient for the processing power it provides. if they had a custom chip baked in, they could get another order of magnitude or two out of it, lowering the work cost for inference to the level of microjoules. the size is more limited by the optics of the camera and the size of the antenna, which must have certain dimensions to transmit and receive radio signals. and again, this isn’t about selling a million of these particular little widgets. as xnor has done already with its clients, the platform and software that runs on it can be customized for individual projects or hardware. one even wanted a model to run on mips — so now it does. by drastically lowering the power and space required to run a self-contained inference engine, entirely new product categories can be created. will they be creepy? probably. but at least they won’t have to phone home."
"joanna glasner contributor more posts by this contributor 2019 us vc funds take a more boutique approach vcs aren’t falling in love with dating startups over the past year, we’ve written a lot about the rise of supergiant venture capital funds. ever since the rollout of the $100 billion softbank vision fund, established vcs have been outdoing each other to raise ever-bigger funds. but let’s not write the epitaph on smaller funds. u.s. venture fundraising data for 2019 reveals a lot of smaller, more focused funds closing on capital. newcomers are rolling out fresh early-stage funds, and even established vcs are opting in many cases to keep fund size constant or even a bit smaller. the influx of small and mid-sized funds serves as a reminder that supergiant funds are somewhat of an aberration for the venture capital industry. while vcs compete to back massively scalable startups, the common wisdom is the venture capital industry itself does not scale especially well. adding more capital to the pot, the thinking goes, likely does more to inflate valuations than foster great companies. silicon valley stalwart kleiner perkins is among the latest to hop on the smaller-is-better bandwagon. three weeks ago, the 47-year-old firm closed on $600 million for its eighteenth flagship fund, touting a plan to go “back to the future” and focus on early-stage with the philosophy that “venture is a non-scalable, boutique craft.” of course, $600 million is by no means a tiny fund. and kleiner’s most prominent growth-stage investment partner, mary meeker, did just leave to start her own firm. nonetheless, it is a step down from kleiner’s last major fundraise in 2016, which brought in $1.4 billion for a growth-stage vehicle and an early-stage fund. meanwhile, crunchbase fundraising data shows plenty of u.s. funds of $200 million or less closing in 2019, as well as several more that are apparently still in fundraising mode. so far, billion-dollar-plus funds are pretty scarce. below, we take a look at the venture fund class of 2019, including newcomers, as well as follow-on funds from established firms. we also focus on rising stars, newer firms that have raised larger new funds. newcomers no matter how many existing venture firms are out chasing startups, there’s always a niche that some newcomer will identify as underserved. so far, 2019 has been no exception. at least five u.s venture firms have announced closings on their inaugural funds this year.1 probably the highest profile new entrant this year is from an already well-known silicon valley investor, steve jurvetson, founder and former managing partner of the 34-year-old vc firm dfj. jurvetson closed on $200 million this month for future ventures, which will focus on early-stage deals in areas including space exploration, quantum computing, ai and synthetic biology. another noteworthy newcomer is motley fool ventures, which is an early-stage, tech-focused venture fund tied to the motley fool investment platform. in a twist on the typical vc model of raising capital from large institutional investors, contributors to the $146 million fund are primarily motley fool members.   biggest funds established vcs have been raising fresh cash, too. so far this year, we haven’t seen a pure-play venture capital firm close a u.s. fund of a billion dollars or more.2 however, we have seen a number of pretty big funds from well-known vcs. last week, menlo ventures, a longstanding valley firm that led one of uber’s early-stage rounds, closed on $500 million for its first inflection fund, which will focus on early growth-stage startups. and on the biotech front, california-based 5am ventures proved the early-stage bird can get the follow-on investment, raising $500 million across two new funds. and on the east coast, boston-based mpm capital closed on $400 million for its seventh flagship fund. rising stars so far this year, we’ve also seen a number of relatively new venture capital firms raise upsized follow-on funds. by relatively new, we generally mean firms that closed their first fund less than five years ago. typically, when we see a firm raising a larger or stable-sized follow-on fund, it indicates a rising star. it usually means that their existing portfolio has seen some successes, and investors are optimistic about future prospects. edtech investor owl ventures meets this criteria. the five-year-old firm closed on $316 million for its third flagship fund this year. to date, san francisco-based owl has invested in at least 24 companies, with a couple of exits and a number of up-rounds under its belt. enthusiasm for the cybersecurity space boosted the fortunes of another firm on our rising star list, teneleven ventures. the five-year-old, silicon valley-based venture firm closed on $200 million for its second early-stage fund this month. fundraising mode clearly, not everyone can raise a billion-dollar venture capital fund. and not everyone wants to. for early-stage in particular, the longstanding practice of raising smaller and mid-sized funds is alive and well. that said, a couple months of fundraising data does not necessarily indicate a long-term trend. we could see a string of billion-dollar-plus funds closing in the next few weeks. or not. for now, however, it looks like pressure to become the next softbank has ebbed some, with unicorn-chasing giants carving out their niche and smaller funds eyeing other opportunities. methodology we focused on u.s.-based firms raising funds that make investments in u.s. companies. this does not include, for instance, a silicon valley-headquartered firm raising a china-focused fund. we also did not include spark capital, which has submitted securities filings laying out plans to raise a $400 million sixth flagship fund and an $800 million growth-stage fund. the new york and boston-based firm, known for its early investments in twitter, slack, coinbase and other unicorns, is widely expected to meet or exceed its fundraising goals, but it has not yet officially closed the funds. the data set includes firms that closed new funds this year, but many have already made a number of investments to date. there were more firms that submitted sec filings indicating plans to raise new funds. we limited the list to firms that disclosed closing on capital. the data set did not include tcv, a firm that closed a $3.2 billion flagship in january. this is because although tcv does back some venture-stage deals, it is primarily a growth-stage investor and also buys stakes in public companies."

or something you hate. feel free to reach out to me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share those thoughts, opinions or tips. eventually, we’ll have a way for readers to sign up and have transportation weekly delivered each week via email. for now, follow me on twitter @kirstenkorosec to ensure you see it each week. now, let’s get to the good stuff. onm … there are oems in the automotive world. and here, (wait for it) there are onms — original news manufacturers. this is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation will live. we promised scoops in transportation weekly and here is one. if you don’t know journalist mark harris, you should. he’s an intrepid gumshoeing reporter whom techcrunch has been lucky enough to hire as a freelancer. follow him @meharris. amazon quietly acquired robotics company dispatch to build scout remember way back in january when amazon introduced scout, their autonomous delivery bot? there was speculation at the time that amazon had bought the estonian-based company starship technologies. harris did some investigating and discovered some of the intellectual property and technology behind scout likely came from a small san francisco startup called dispatch that amazon stealthily acquired in 2017. it’s time to stop thinking about amazon as just an e-commerce company. it’s a gigantic logistics company, probably the biggest on the planet, with a keen interest — and the cash to pursue those interests — in automation. think beyond scout. in fact, wander on down this post to the deal of the week. dig in each week, transportation weekly will spend a little extra time on an approach, policy, tech or the people behind it in our “dig in” section. we’ll run the occasional column here, too. this week features a conversation with dmitri dolgov, the cto and vp of engineering at waymo, the former google self-driving project that spun out to become a business under alphabet. ten years ago, right around now, about a dozen engineers started working on project chauffeur, which would turn into the google self-driving project and eventually become an official company called waymo . along the way, the project would give rise to a number of high-profile engineers who would go on to create their own companies. it’s a list that includes aurora co-founder chris urmson, argo ai co-founder bryan salesky and anthony levandowski, who helped launch otto and more recently pronto.ai. what might be less known is that many of those in the original dozen are still at waymo, including dolgov, andrew chatham, dirk haehnel, nathaniel fairfield and mike montemerlo. dolgov and i talked about the early days, challenges and what’s next. a couple of things stood out during our chat… there is a huge difference between having a prototype that can do something once or twice or four times versus building a product that people can start using in their daily lives. and it is, especially in this field, very easy to make progress on these kinds of one-off challenges. dolgov’s take on how engineers viewed the potential of the project 10 years ago … i also use our cars every day to get around, this is how i got to work today. this is how i run errands around here in mountain view and palo alto. a little bird … we hear a lot. but we’re not selfish. let’s share. an early investor, or investors, in bird appear to be selling some of their shares in the scooter company, per a tip backed up by data over at secondary trading platform equityzen. that’s not crazy considering the company is valued at $2 billion-ish. seed investors should take some money off the table once a company reaches that valuation. we’ve heard that david sacks at craft ventures hasn’t sold a single bird share. we hear tusk ventures hasn’t sold, either. that leaves a few others, including goldcrest capital, which was the lone seed investor, and then series a participants lead edge capital, m13, and valor equity partners. got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation? email me or send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec. while you’re over at twitter, check out this cheeky account @sdelevator. we can’t guarantee how much of the content is actually “overheard” and how much is manufactured for the laughs, but it’s a fun account to peruse from time to time. “is this really the state of vc today?” https://t.co/gmphv3fn6q — selfdrivingelevator (@sdelevator) february 7, 2019 another new entrant to the mobility parody genre is @heardinmobilty. deal of the week there’s so much to choose from this week, but aurora’s more than $530 million series b funding round announced thursday morning is the winner. the upshot? it’s not just that aurora is now valued at more than $2.5 billion. the primary investors in the round — sequoia as lead and “significant” investments from amazon and t. rowe price — suggests aurora’s full self-driving stack is headed for other uses beyond shuttling people around in autonomous vehicles. perhaps delivery is next. and believe it or not, the type of investor in this round tells me that we can expect another capital raise. yes, aurora has lots of runway now as well as three publicly named customers. but investors like sequoia, which led the round and whose partner carl eschenbach is joining aurora’s board, t. rowe price and amazon, along with repeaters like index ventures (general partner mike volpi is also on the board) have patience, access to cash and long-term strategic thinking. expect more from them. other deals that got our attention this week: lime raises $310 million self-driving truck startup ike raises $52 million tesla’s acquisition of maxwell technologies for $218 million online car retail platform brumbrum raises $23 million led by accel car subscription service cluno raises $28 million led by valar ventures, the firm founded by peter thiel snapshot speaking of deals and tesla … the automaker’s $218 million acquisition this month of maxwell technologies got me thinking about companies it has targeted in the past. so, we went ahead and built a handy chart to provide a snapshot view of some of tesla’s noteworthy acquisitions.  one note: tesla ceo elon musk tweeted in 2018 that the company had acquired trucking carrier companies to help improve its delivery logistics. we’ve dug in and have yet to land on the company, or companies, tesla acquired. the deals that got away are just as interesting. that list includes a reported $325 million offer to buy simbol materials, the startup that was extracting small amounts of lithium near the salton sea east of san diego. tiny but mighty mobility between lime’s $310 million series d round and the seemingly never-ending battle to operate electric scooters in san francisco, it’s clear that micromobility is not so micro. lime, a shared electric scooter and bike-share startup, has now raised north of $800 million in total funding, surpassing key competitor bird’s total funding of $415 million. thanks to this week’s round of funding, lime’s micromobility business is now worth $2.4 billion. lime currently operates its bikes and scooters in more than 100 cities worldwide. over in san francisco, however, lime has yet to deploy any of its modes of transportation. since last march, there’s been an ongoing battle among scooter operators to deploy their services in the city. the city ultimately selected skip and scoot for the pilot programs, leaving the likes of lime, uber’s jump and spin to appeal the decision. a neutral hearing officer has since determined sf’s process for determining scooter operators was fair, but the silver lining for the likes of jump, spin and, most likely, lime, is that the city may open up its pilot program to allow additional operators beginning in april. notable reads two recent studies got my attention. the first is from bike pittsburgh, an advocacy group and partner of uber, that published the findings from its latest av survey based on responses from local residents. the last time they conducted a similar survey was in 2017. the takeaway: people there, who are among the most exposed to autonomous vehicles due to all the av testing on public roads, are getting used to it. a bit more than 48 percent of respondents said they approve of public av testing in pittsburgh, down slightly from 49 percent approval rating in 2017.  21.21% somewhat approve 11.62% neutral 10.73% somewhat disapprove 8.73% disapprove one standout result was surrounding responses about the fatal accident in tempe, ariz. involving a self-driving uber that struck and killed pedestrian elaine herzberg in march 2018. survey participants were asked “as a pedestrian or a bicyclist how did this event and it’s outcome change your opinion about sharing the road with avs?” some 60 percent of respondents claimed no change in their opinion, with another 37 percent claiming that it negatively changed their opinion. nearly 3 percent claimed their opinion changed positively toward the technology. bike pittsburgh noted that the survey elicited passionate open-ended responses.  “the incident did not turn too many people off of av technology in general,” according to bike pittsburgh. “rather it did lead to a growing distrust of the companies themselves, specifically with uber and how they handled the fatality.” the other study, “securing the modern vehicle: a study of automotive industry cybersecurity practices,” was released by synopsys, inc. and sae international. the results, based on a survey of global automotive manufacturers and suppliers conducted by ponemon institute, doesn’t assuage my concerns. if anything, it puts me on alert. 84% of automotive professionals have concerns that their organizations’ cybersecurity practices are not keeping pace with evolving technologies 30% of organizations don’t have an established cybersecurity program or team 63% test less than half of the automotive technology they develop for security vulnerabilities testing and deployments pilots, pilots everywhere. a couple of interesting mobility pilots and deployments stand out. optimus ride, the boston-based mit spin-off, has made a deal with brookfield properties to provide rides in its small self-driving vehicles at halley rise — a new $1.4 billion mixed-use development in virginia.  this is an example of where we see self-driving vehicles headed — for now. small deployments that are narrowly focused in geography with a predictable customer base are the emerging trend of 2019. expect more of them. and there’s a reason why these are the kinds of pilots that will deliver the data needed to improve their technology, as well as test out business models — gotta figure out how to make money with avs eventually — hone in fleet operational efficiency, placate existing investors while attracting new ones and recruit talent. another deployment in the more conventional ride-hailing side of mobility is with beat, the startup that has focused its efforts on latin america. beat was founded by nikos drandakis in 2011 initially as taxibeat. the startup was acquired by daimler’s mytaxi in february 2017 and drandakis still runs the show. the company was focused on europe but shifted to latin america, and it has made all the difference. (beat is still available in athens, greece.) beat has launched in lima, peru, santiago, chile and bogota, colombia and now boasts 200,000 registered drivers.  now it’s moving into mexico, where more competitors exist. the company just started registering and screening drivers in mexico city as it prepares to offer rides for passengers this month.  techcrunch spoke at length with drandakis. look out for a deeper dive soon. until next week, nos vemos."
"over the last few years, millions of chinese workers managed to earn extra money by being ride-hailing drivers. many picked the gig because of its flexible schedule. for those who could not otherwise afford to own a car in china’s pricey metropolises, driving around is also a status symbol, even if they are paying off car loans every month. most drivers on didi chuxing — the startup that captured 90 percent of china’s e-hailing trips in 2017 per consulting firm bain & company — were part-time. that’s according to a report didi put out in october 2017, which said half of its drivers worked less than two hours a day. the report also hailed didi as the epitome of china’s “sharing economy,” something that beijing has been keen to promote to spur economic growth. the all-encompassing term, which includes shared platforms from mobility to elderly care services, raked in $764 billion in 2017, shows a report by china’s sharing economy research center of the state information center. but gig work in china’s fledgling ride-hailing industry is coming to an end as new regulations make part-time driving overly expensive. no more gigs on january 1, ride-hailing apps in china start banning drivers who operate without the required “double licenses”: one for drivers and another for the cars they steer. municipal governments across the country have nuanced stipulations for what these certificates entail, but in general, the fresh rules aim to more closely vet drivers transporting passengers around. to obtain the ride-hailing driver’s permit in certain cities, drivers must provide a no-criminal-record certificate. in some extreme cases, they must also own a local hukou, the residency permit that controls where people can legally work. a lot of ride-hailing drivers don’t have an urban hukou as they are migrant workers from rural parts of china, so they immediately become ineligible for ride-hailing apps. the car license, on the other hand, requires the vehicle to operate as a commercial one, bringing additional costs to drivers who must absorb the costs of car insurance and maintenance, and scrap their vehicle after 8 years. all ride-hailing vehicles in china must possess the required license (circled in red) to be on the roads starting january 1, 2019. photo credit: techcrunch under the new legal framework, drivers can still work as independent contractors. but in effect, the policy shift is driving out casual workers. “no part-time drivers want to register their private car as a commercial one because of the high costs that come with it,” a shenzhen-based didi driver tells techcrunch. “being part-time doesn’t pay the bills anymore.” didi’s dilemma like a lot of china’s nascent industries, ride-hailing took off quickly in part thanks to relatively lax government oversight at the start. the first set of industry laws took effect in 2016, when the country officially legalized apps like uber, which was later acquired by its local competitor didi. since then, chinese authorities have gradually rolled out more rules, and the strictest regulations, including the rollout of the double licenses, came following the deaths of two passengers who used didi last year. the new policies have put a squeeze on driver and car numbers. in the tier 2 city of nanjing alone, didi claims to have weeded out more than 160,000 illegal vehicles, local media reported. the sharp decline in cars available on the roads inevitably leads to longer wait time and user frustration, and the $56 billion giant will need to think of ways to maintain a constant supply of drivers. didi launches lending and insurance as new regulation threatens to lower driver numbers didi took off on account of generous subsidies for both users and drivers, but its staggering loss — which is said to stand at $585 million in the first half of 2018 — means it may not be offering cash-heavy incentives in the near term. to retain labor, didi is offering test prep for drivers. it’s also lowered the barriers to entry by letting drivers rent licensed cars it sources from car rental and automaker partners. a catchphrase started to pop up on didi’s mobile app for drivers in december: “you supply the manpower, we provide the car.” aside from regulatory hurdles, didi also faces new challengers like bmw and volkswagen’s china partner saic motor, traditional carmakers that are entering the ride-hailing scene. “didi has educated china about what is ride-hailing. if it doesn’t react swiftly to changing dynamics, the billions of yuan it’s burned through will suffer from low returns,” dong feng, founder of a chinese car rental startup suggests to techcrunch. update (january 1, 8:00 am, gmt+8): adds details for the ride-hailing driver’s license"
"daimler ag and bmw group officially agreed to merge their urban mobility services into a single holding company back in march 2018 with a 50 percent stake each. and now, they want to unify their services under five categories by creating five joint ventures — reach now, charge now, park now, free now and share now. both automakers plan to invest $1.1 billion (€1 billion) to foster these urban mobility services over the coming years. there are already 60 million people using one of the 14 services currently available. let’s go through the details. free now is the name of the ride-hailing company, which includes mytaxi, kapten, clever taxi and beat. those services combined operate in 130 cities in 17 countries. hive, a new e-scooter company, is also part of free now. mytaxi, a popular app that lets you hail a taxi from your phone, already sent an email to its customers saying that the company will rebrand its service to free now later this year. it’s unclear what’s going to happen to the other brands. chauffeur-privé recently rebranded to kapten, so it sounds like apps and services won’t merge overnight. charge now already exists and is a network of public charge points for electric cars. it provides a white label service for car manufacturers as well. so nothing is changing there. park now combines an existing service called parknow (i know, it’s confusing), parkmobile, ringgo and park-line. as the names suggest, they all operate parking services. share now is all about free-floating services. daimler and bmw each had its own service, drivenow and car2go; they’re now under the same roof. the new reach now combines moovel with an existing service called reachnow. this one is a bit weird as moovel lets you access various transportation methods from a single app. you can find your itinerary, and book and pay for various services through the app. the old reachnow is different as it’s a ride-hailing service in seattle and portland. that wasn’t easy to unpack. it’s clear that things are still moving and plans aren’t set in stone when it comes to integrations and brand simplification. eventually, bmw ceo harald krüger hopes that all of those services will converge and form an end-to-end service. “we have a clear vision: these five services will merge ever more closely to form a single mobility service portfolio with an all-electric, self-driving fleet of vehicles that charge and park autonomously and interconnect with the other modes of transport,” he said in the release. while it sounds like a wild dream, it’s interesting to see that daimler and bmw are both very serious about mobility services. they know that they can’t just be car manufacturers, and must expand beyond their traditional role. it’s a competitive industry with well-funded giants, such as uber and didi. and if daimler and bmw want to remain relevant, they need to invest and develop these services."
"did anyone else listen to season one of startup, alex blumberg’s og gimlet podcast? i did, and i felt like a proud mom this week reading stories of the major, first-of-its-kind spotify acquisition of his podcast production company, gimlet. spotify also bought anchor, a podcast monetization platform, signaling a new era for the podcasting industry. on top of that, himalaya media, a free podcast app i’d never heard of until this week, raised a whopping $100 million in venture capital funding to “establish itself as a new force in the podcast distribution space,” per variety. the podcasting business definitely took center stage, but lime and bird made headlines, as usual, a new unicorn emerged in the mental health space and instacart, it turns out, has been screwing its independent contractors. spotify gets acquisitive as mentioned, spotify, or shall we say spodify, gobbled up gimlet and anchor. more on that here and a full analysis of the deal here. key takeaway: it’s the dawn of podcasting; expect a whole lot more venture investment and m&a activity in the next few years. instacart “maliciously misappropriated gratuities” this week’s biggest “yikes” moment was when reports emerged that instacart was offsetting its wages with tips from customers. an independent contractor has filed a class-action lawsuit against the food delivery business, claiming it “intentionally and maliciously misappropriated gratuities in order to pay plaintiff’s wages even though instacart maintained that 100 percent of customer tips went directly to shoppers.” techcrunch’s megan rose dickey has the full story here, as well as instacart ceo’s apology here. slack and postmates move closer to the public markets  slack confidentially filed to go public this week, its first public step toward either an ipo or a direct listing. if it chooses the latter, like spotify did in 2018, it won’t issue any new shares. instead, it will sell existing shares held by insiders, employees and investors, a move that will allow it to bypass a roadshow and some of wall street’s exorbitant ipo fees. postmates confidentially filed, too. the 8-year-old company has tapped jpmorgan chase and bank of america to lead its upcoming float. reddit ceo steve huffman delivers remarks on “redesigning reddit” during the third day of web summit in altice arena on november 08, 2017 in lisbon, portugal. (horacio villalobos-corbis/contributor) deal of the week it was particularly tough to decide which deal was the most notable this week… but the winner is reddit, the online platform for chit-chatting about niche topics — r/progmetal if you’re crunchbase editor alex wilhelm . the company is raising up to $300 million at a $3 billion valuation, according to techcrunch’s josh constine. reddit has been around since 2005 and has raised a total of $250 million in equity funding. the forthcoming series d round is said to be led by chinese tech giant tencent at a $2.7 billion pre-money valuation. the very first mental health unicorn runner up for deal of the week is calm, the app that helps users reduce anxiety, sleep better and feel happier. the startup brought in an $88 million series b at a $1 billion valuation. with 40 million downloads worldwide and more than one million paying subscribers, the company says it quadrupled revenue in 2018 from $20 million to $80 million and is now profitable — not a word you hear every day in silicon valley. here’s your weekly reminder to send me tips, suggestions and more to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or @kateclarktweets.  scooters i listened to the bird ceo’s chat with upfront ventures’ mark suster last week and wrote down some key takeaways, including the challenges of seasonality and safety in the scooter business. i also wrote about an investigation by consumer reports that found electric scooters to be the cause of more than 1,500 accidents in the u.s. i’m also required to mention that e-scooter unicorn lime finally closed its highly anticipated round at a $2.4 billion valuation. the news came just a few days after the company beefed up its executive team with a cto and cmo hire. more startup cash databricks raises $250m at a $2.75b valuation for its analytics platform retail technology platform relex raises $200m from tcv raisin raises $114m for its pan-european marketplace for savings and investment products self-driving truck startup ike raises $52m signal sciences secures $35m to protect web apps ritual raises $25m for its subscription-based women’s daily vitamin little spoon gets $7m for its organic baby food delivery service by humankind picks up $4m to rid your morning routine of single-use plastic turvo gets the spotlight we don’t spend a ton of time talking about the growing, venture-funded, tech-enabled logistics sector, but one startup in the space garnered significant attention this week. turvo poached three key uber freight employees, including two of the unit’s co-founders. what’s that mean for uber freight? well, probably not a ton… based on my conversation with turvo’s newest employees, uber freight is a rocket ship waiting to take off. surprise! there’s money in women’s brands who knew that investing in female-focused brands could turn a profit for investors? just kidding, i knew that and this week i have even more proof! this is l., a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based retailer of pads, tampons and condoms made with organic materials sold to p&g for $100 million. the company, founded by talia frenkel, launched out of y combinator in august 2015. according to pitchbook, it was backed by halogen ventures, 500 startups, fusion fund and a few others. fresh faces speaking of ladies getting stuff done, bessemer venture partners promoted talia goldberg to partner this week, making the 28-year-old one of the youngest investing partners at the silicon valley venture fund. plus, palo alto’s eclipse ventures, hot off the heels of a $500 million fundraise, added two general partners: former flex ceo mike mcnamara and former global foundries ceo sanjay jha. listen to me talk if you enjoy this newsletter, be sure to check out techcrunch’s venture-focused podcast, equity. in this week’s episode, available here, crunchbase editor-in-chief alex wilhelm and i chat about the expanding podcast industry, reddit’s big round and scooter accidents. want more techcrunch newsletters? sign up here."
"jonathan teo, long a bay area venture capitalist, might be regretting having a twitter account tonight. the reason: it was used to serve a summons to teo by the law firm baker curtis & schwartz, which represents a former employee of the early-stage venture firm teo had cofounded in 2014, binary capital. the plaintiff is ann lai, who joined binary in 2015. her role at the firm, according to her complaint, was to be “primarily responsible for establishing [binary’s] data-driven sourcing strategy, conducting the diligence regarding their potential investments, and supporting their portfolio companies on analytics/growth strategies.” yet lai, who has three harvard degrees, says that she battled discrimination and harassment on the job “almost from the day she started work,” according to her lawsuit. among lai’s grievances: that teo and firm cofounder justin caldbeck “requested and received headshots of female applicants that they sought to hire, and assessed these headshots for attractiveness. they also searched the applicants’ social media profiles to determine their relative ‘hotness.'” the complaint also states the teo, caldbeck, and binary, which the two controlled, “expressed a desire to hold a company retreat, without significant others, at a location in which no one would wear clothes.” the lurid details go on. ultimately, states the complaint — which was originally filed by lai’s attorneys in 2017 and amended back in september — lai was denied benefits, opportunities, and compensation owed to her because she pushed back against such conduct. she was also forced to resign and was defamed by both caldbeck and teo in the aftermath of her departure, says the suit, which seeks civil penalties. the information first reported in june of 2017 that, according to half a dozen women in the tech industry, caldbeck had made unwanted advanced toward them. he resigned shortly afterward, while teo fought unsuccessfully to keep binary a going concern. what happens next remains to be seen, but it’s certainly interesting that lai’s attorneys used social media to reach teo. they had no choice, they argue in an “ex parte application for order of publication of summons.” they say they tried reaching his attorneys as well as reaching teo at the address where he last lived in san francisco, but they say that not only has teo since moved to an unknown address, his attorneys claimed to not know his whereabouts and refused to accept the summons on his behalf. there was a precedent for the lawyers’ move. in fact, multiple cases have been granted similar approval by the court system to reach subjects via both facebook and twitter after they evaded being served, largely because social media is now the one point of contact that people typically maintain even when they flee to a foreign country of otherwise make themselves difficult to locate. for his part, teo last tweeted from his account on december 12. reached for comment about the action taken and the complaint itself, teo responded via email, “it’s important to know that even a filed complaint can be made up of complete untruths.” worth noting: lai’s attorneys — who also represented former uber engineer susan fowler after she published her account of sexual harassment and sexism at the company — were able to serve caldbeck this fall, they say through filings. caldbeck subsequently agreed to pay lai $85,000 in exchange for her dismissing litigation against him personally."
"while softbank continues to make big bets on startups out of its $100 billion vision fund, it has also launched another vehicle to invest in tech opportunities specifically in latin america. today the group announced the softbank innovation fund, which is starting out with a $2 billion commitment to invest in tech startups in central and south america, specifically starting in the countries of argentina, brazil, chile, colombia and mexico, covering areas like e-commerce, digital financial services, healthcare, mobility and insurance. alongside this, it’s establishing a group called the softbank latin america local hub, which will partner with companies that are already in softbank’s investment portfolio to help them break into the region. the effort in latin america is a big win for marcelo claure, who has been named ceo of softbank latin america. claure is already coo of softbank group corp., as well as ceo of softbank group international and executive chairman of sprint corporation — all roles he will continue to keep as he takes on this new challenge. “growing up in latin america i witnessed firsthand the creativity and passion of the people,” said claure in a statement. “there is so much innovation and disruption taking place in the region, and i believe the business opportunities have never been stronger. the softbank innovation fund will become a major investor in transformative latin american companies that are poised to redefine their industries and create new economic opportunities for millions of people.” this is the first time that softbank has created a fund of this kind focused on a single region — although it has spearheaded big bets into specific countries like india in the past — and it appears to be the first time that it has formally established a group to help other portfolio companies expand in a region, although this is likely something that softbank would have been doing on an informal basis before now. news of this fund had been trickling out for some time, although a report in bloomberg from january, which broke the news, had underestimated the amount that softbank would invest in it (it predicted $1 billion, while the actual starting amount is $2 billion). softbank says that it has yet to determine where it will establish its hq for this new effort. i don’t imagine this question will take on the heated race that we saw unfold around amazon’s hq2 decision-making process. likely candidates will probably be cities where softbank has already established operations in the region. indeed, softbank is no stranger to investing in latin america as part of its bigger “bric” strategy. as a developing market with a growing middle class (more than 50 million people in the region have entered the middle class, generating increased disposable income, softbank said), it is one of the fastest-growing regions for tech products and services. softbank estimates that the region accounts for 10 percent of the world’s population and 8 percent of the world’s gdp. notably — given softbank’s previous focus on asia — it points out that this means it has “two times the gdp of india and half that of china.” so far, softbank’s investments in the region have focused on e-commerce and related consumer services. it was one of the early investors in uber rival 99 in brazil (which eventually was taken over by didi, the chinese transportation giant that softbank also partly owns). it has also put at least $100 million into loggi, another startup out of brazil that focuses on delivery services. in mexico, it is also embarking on a joint venture with didi to establish transportation services there. it’s likely the strong track record it has had in those investments so far that led softbank to extend its activities there, particularly since it has already established a strong bulkhead in different regions across asia, including china and india. “latin america is on the cusp of becoming one of the most important economic regions in the world, and we anticipate significant growth in the decades ahead,” said masayoshi son, chairman and chief executive officer of sbg, in a statement. “sbg plans to invest in entrepreneurs throughout latin america and use technology to help address the challenges faced by many emerging economies with the goal of improving the lives of millions of latin americans. i am grateful to our chief operating officer marcelo claure for leading this initiative, in addition to his other responsibilities at sbg.” as with other softbank investments that do not come out of its vision fund, the latter will potentially use this as a springboard to get involved, as well. “latin america presents significant opportunities for softbank group, and the vision fund will have the ability to co-invest alongside the innovation fund,” said rajeev misra, ceo of softbank investment advisers, who runs the vision fund. “marcelo and team will offer invaluable expertise to help latin american companies scale their operations, benefit from the greater softbank ecosystem, and grow into global market leaders.” the vision fund has come under some scrutiny because of its ties to saudi money and the controversy surrounding that government’s human rights policies. for investors like softbank, focusing attention on latin america makes a lot of sense. not only does that help it diversify by focusing on another (rapidly growing) region, but it gives the group one more way to sweeten the deal to invest in any fast-growing startup, by offering a helping hand in their efforts to expand to other regions by way of their network of contacts and existing services. in addition to people getting more well-off in the region, there are other indicators that point to it being a healthy market for tech investment. latin america has 375 million internet users and 250 million smartphone users, putting it ahead of the u.s. in terms of sheer numbers. and retail e-commerce has nearly doubled in the last three years, going to $54 billion in 2018 from $29.8 billion in 2015. similarly, there is a big opportunity ahead because of what the region doesn’t have. some 400 million people are still without bank accounts or credit histories; and while 79 percent of the population lives in urban areas, those people generally don’t get great access to public transport. healthcare has also been an area of underinvestment up to now, opening the door to building and expanding medical, wellness and other related solutions. but to be clear, there are already a ton of companies and entrepreneurs (and talent) in the region, so this is as much about getting closer to them, and helping them grow with funding, as it is about bringing in startups from outside the region to tap these opportunities. softbank hopes that by setting out its stall in the heart of it, it will have a shot at profiting from both."
"late last week, we announced the schedule for april 18’s tc sessions: robotics + ai event at uc berkeley, including some heavy hitters like marc raibert, melonee wise and ken goldberg. at the time, we noted we still had some big names left to reveal — and we weren’t joking. today we’re excited to announce that we’ll be joined by autonomous vehicle pioneer anthony levandowski. levandowski is the co-founder and ceo of pronto, a new startup developing aftermarket kits for semi-trucks. the company is touting the safety potential of autonomous vehicle technologies for cross-country hauls. “we are not building technology that tells vehicles how to drive,” he wrote in a medium post announcing pronto’s launch. “instead, our team of engineers is building tech that can learn how to drive the way people do.” before founding pronto, levandowski served as the head of uber’s autonomous vehicle program and helped google develop its own initiative that ultimately became waymo. the engineer began his career by building the autonomous motorcycle ghostrider for darpa’s grand challenge. early-bird ticket sales end in less than two weeks. grab your ticket for just $249 today and save $100. student tickets are on sale for just $45 and can be purchased here. are you an early-stage startup in robotics or ai? grab a $1,500 demo table at the event and get your company in front of 1,000+ tech enthusiasts and investors."
"vmware announced a new kubernetes product today called vmware essential pks, which has been created from its acquisition of heptio for $550 million at the end of last year. vmware already had two flavors of kubernetes, a fully managed cloud product and an enterprise version with all of the components, such as registry and network, pre-selected by vmware. what this new version does is provide a completely open version of kubernetes where the customer can choose all the components, giving a flexible option for those who want it, according to scott buchanan, senior director of product marketing for cloud-native apps at vmware. buchanan said the new product comes directly from the approach that heptio had taken to selling kubernetes prior to the acquisition. “we’re introducing a new offering called vmware essential pks, and that offering is a packaging of the approach that heptio took to market and that gained a lot of traction, and that approach is a natural complement to the other kubernetes products in the vmware portfolio,” he explained. buchanan acknowledged that a large part of the market is going to go for the fully managed or fully configured approaches, but there is a subset of buyers that will want more choice in their kubernetes implementation. “larger enterprises with more complex infrastructure want to have a very customized approach to how they build out their architecture. they don’t want to be integrated. they just want a foundation on which to build because the organizations are larger and more complex and they’re also more likely to have an internal devops or sreops team to operate the platform on a day-to-day basis,” he explained. while these organizations want flexibility, they also require more of a consultative approach to the sale. heptio had a 40-person field service engineering team that came over in the acquisition, and vmware is in the process of scaling that team. these folks consult with the customer and help them select the different components that make up a kubernetes installation to fit the needs of each organization. buchanan, who also came over in the acquisition, says that being part of vmware (which is part of the dell family of companies) means they have several layers of sales with vmware, pivotal and dell all selling the product. heptio is the kubernetes startup founded by craig mcluckie and joe beda, the two men who helped develop the technology while they were at google. heptio was founded in 2016 and raised $33.5 million prior to the acquisition, according to crunchbase data. four years after its release, kubernetes has come a long way"
"when you think of mwc barcelona, chances are you’re thinking about the newest smartphones and other mobile gadgets, but that’s only half the story. actually, it’s probably far less than half the story because the majority of the business that’s done at mwc is enterprise telco business. not too long ago, that business was all about selling expensive proprietary hardware. today, it’s about moving all of that into software — and a lot of that software is open source. it’s maybe no surprise then that this year, the linux foundation (lf) has its own booth at mwc. it’s not massive, but it’s big enough to have its own meeting space. the booth is shared by the three lf projects: the cloud native computing foundation (cncf), hyperleger and linux foundation networking, the home of many of the foundational projects like onap and the open platform for nfv (opnfv) that power many a modern network. and with the advent of 5g, there’s a lot of new market share to grab here. to discuss the cncf’s role at the event, i sat down with dan kohn, the executive director of the cncf. at mwc, the cncf launched its testbed for comparing the performance of virtual network functions on openstack and what the cncf calls cloud-native network functions, using kubernetes (with the help of bare-metal host packet). the project’s results — at least so far — show that the cloud-native container-based stack can handle far more network functions per second than the competing openstack code. “the message that we are sending is that kubernetes as a universal platform that runs on top of bare metal or any cloud, most of your virtual network functions can be ported over to cloud-native network functions,” kohn said. “all of your operating support system, all of your business support system software can also run on kubernetes on the same cluster.” openstack, in case you are not familiar with it, is another massive open-source project that helps enterprises manage their own data center software infrastructure. one of openstack’s biggest markets has long been the telco industry. there has always been a bit of friction between the two foundations, especially now that the openstack foundation has opened up its organizations to projects that aren’t directly related to the core openstack projects. i asked kohn if he is explicitly positioning the cncf/kubernetes stack as an openstack competitor. “yes, our view is that people should be running kubernetes on bare metal and that there’s no need for a middle layer,” he said — and that’s something the cncf has never stated quite as explicitly before but that was always playing in the background. he also acknowledged that some of this friction stems from the fact that the cncf and the openstack foundation now compete for projects. openstack foundation, unsurprisingly, doesn’t agree. “pitting kubernetes against openstack is extremely counterproductive and ignores the fact that openstack is already powering 5g networks, in many cases in combination with kubernetes,” openstack coo mark collier told me. “it also reflects a lack of understanding about what openstack actually does, by suggesting that it’s simply a virtual machine orchestrator. that description is several years out of date. moving away from vms, which makes sense for many workloads, does not mean moving away from openstack, which manages bare metal, networking and authentication in these environments through the ironic, neutron and keystone services.” similarly, ex-openstack foundation board member (and mirantis co-founder) boris renski told me that “just because containers can replace vms, this doesn’t mean that kubernetes replaces openstack. kubernetes’ fundamental design assumes that something else is there that abstracts away low-level infrastructure, and is meant to be an application-aware container scheduler. openstack, on the other hand, is specifically designed to abstract away low-level infrastructure constructs like bare metal, storage, etc.” this overall theme continued with kohn and the cncf taking a swipe at kata containers, the first project the openstack foundation took on after it opened itself up to other projects. kata containers promises to offer a combination of the flexibility of containers with the additional security of traditional virtual machines. “we’ve got this fud out there around kata and saying: telco’s will need to use kata, a) because of the noisy neighbor problem and b) because of the security,” said kohn. “first of all, that’s fud and second, micro-vms are a really interesting space.” he believes it’s an interesting space for situations where you are running third-party code (think aws lambda running firecracker) — but telcos don’t typically run that kind of code. he also argues that kubernetes handles noisy neighbors just fine because you can constrain how many resources each container gets. it seems both organizations have a fair argument here. on the one hand, kubernetes may be able to handle some use cases better and provide higher throughput than openstack. on the other hand, openstack handles plenty of other use cases, too, and this is a very specific use case. what’s clear, though, is that there’s quite a bit of friction here, which is a shame."
"is it happening? is it not happening? after years of back and forth, it looks like the new tax on tech giants in france is about to become a law. big tech companies that generate significant revenue in france will be taxed on their revenue generated in france. economy minister bruno le maire has been lobbying for a new tax so that tech giants would stop optimizing their european corporate structure to lower their effective tax rate. originally, le maire wanted to convince other european countries to get on board. but you need a unanimous vote when it comes to tax reforms in europe. and le maire couldn’t convince everyone. le maire still wanted to do something. so here we are, with a new tax on tech companies that generate more than €750 million in revenue globally and €25 million in france. if you’re operating a marketplace (amazon’s marketplace, uber, airbnb…) or an advertising business (facebook, google, criteo…), you will have to pay 3 percent of your french revenue in taxes. the government says that it isn’t against american companies, as european and asian companies are also about to get taxed. it’s a weird taxation model as it is based on revenue and not profit. it’ll also require some work from the taxation administration, as french revenue means that it involves all transactions with somebody with a french mailing address or a french ip address. france expects to generate €400 million in revenue with this new tax in 2019. i’ve been talking about this new tax with people in the french tech ecosystem and they think it’s a publicity stunt more than anything else. the oecd has been working on a way to properly tax tech companies with a standardized set of rules. it could still take a couple of years, but it would be based on profit and it would clarify the situation across dozens of countries. it would replace today’s new tax. don’t get me wrong. taxing tech giants is important and tech companies have been fined for tax avoidance for too many years. but this feels a bit rushed. apple has finished paying $15 billion european fine amazon settles tax optimization dispute with french authorities google is preparing to pay a huge fine for tax noncompliance in france"
"early last year, linkedin co-founder and prolific venture capital investor reid hoffman called chris urmson “the henry ford of autonomous vehicles (av).” the vote of confidence and big check from hoffman, coupled with a team of deeply knowledgable av entrepreneurs, has catapulted his company, aurora innovation, squarely into “unicorn” territory. aurora, the developer of a full-stack self-driving software system for automobile manufacturers, is raising at least $500 million in equity funding at more than a $2 billion valuation in a round expected to be led by new investor sequoia capital, according to a recode report. a $500 million financing would bring aurora’s total raised to date to $596 million and would provide a 4x increase to its most recent valuation. the company, founded in 2016, raised a $90 million series a last february from hoffman’s greylock partners and index ventures . hoffman and index general partner mike volpi joined aurora’s board as part of the deal. greylock and index are aurora’s only existing investors, per pitchbook data. the young business has a lean cap table often characteristic of startup’s led by experienced entrepreneurs able to secure financing deals briskly from top vcs. aurora’s c-suite is chock-full of veteran av workers. urmson, for his part, formerly headed up the self-driving vehicles program at google, now known as waymo. chief technology officer drew bagnell was head of perception and autonomy at uber and sterling anderson, aurora’s chief product officer, directed the autopilot program at tesla from 2015 to 2016. “between these three co-founders, they have been thinking and working collectively in robotics, automation automotive products for over 40 years,” hoffman wrote in a blog post announcing aurora’s series a funding. in addition to the high-caliber of the founding team, aurora’s collaborative approach to building self-driving cars has attracted investors, too. the company has partnered with a number of automotive retailers to integrate its technology into their vehicles and make self-driving cars a “practical reality.” currently, aurora counts volkswagen, hyundai and chinese manufacturer byton as partners.  2018 was a banner year for vc investment in u.s. autonomous vehicle startups. in total, investors poured $1.6 billion across 58 deals, nearly doubling 2017’s high of $893 million. around the world, av startups secured $3.41 billion, on par with the $3.48 billion invested in 2017, per pitchbook. though we are just days into 2019, lidar technology developer aeye has completed a previously announced $40 million series b. the pleasanton, calif.-headquartered company raised the funds from taiwania capital, kleiner perkins, intel capital, airbus ventures and tychee partners. and last week, sydney-based baraja, another lidar startup, brought in a $32 million series a from sequoia china, main sequence ventures’ csiro innovation fund and blackbird ventures. lidar startup aeye raises $40m series b led by the taiwanese government’s investment firm"
"memes are the new vernacular of political culture and we dismiss them at our own peril. liberals learned this the hard way late in the presidential campaign, when they began realizing how deftly the alt-right was able to use viral jokes, hashtags, and images as a propaganda tool, often to bolster white supremacist ideology. the phenomenon was propagated by donald trump, often through retweets (the president’s twitter account, @realdonaldtrump, is arguably a meme farm at the highest level of government). progressives have tried to fight back with their own memes, but nothing has gained the potency of say, new vocabulary like “cuck” or pepe the frog, the comic book character whose misappropriation as an alt-right mascot was condemned by its creator matt furie and his publisher. but the left finally has a way to take back meme culture. instead of originating from the anonymous bowels of 4chan or reddit, it’s coming from capitol hill: the social media accounts of rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (often referred to as aoc, which is also her twitter handle). not only is she fluent in internet culture, but ocasio-cortez is also willing to take advantage of it, even as critics dismiss her, the youngest woman ever elected to congress, as a “little girl” or demand that her cohort of democrats “stop acting like young people,” as aaron sorkin did during a recent cnn interview. we meme irl too 😂👋🏽 https://t.co/0nhfsutiwc — alexandria ocasio-cortez (@aoc) january 20, 2019 ocasio-cortez’s tweets mix her knowledge of internet and gaming culture with statements about serious issues like taxation, income inequality, fossil-fuel pollution, and transgender rights, while her instagram posts and stories give followers a behind-the-scenes look at congress. she’s prompted important policy discussions, most notably in the case of marginal tax rates, turned mitch mcconnell into a meme (#wheresmitch), and even made a c-span video go viral. sworn into congress less than a month ago, ocasio-cortez’s impact on political discourse is already obvious. this was highlighted over the weekend, first when ocasio-cortez tweeted “all your base (are) belong to us” about the popularity of her tax rate proposal, which calls for earnings higher than $10 million to be taxed at 70 percent, among both republicans and democrats. though the meme itself has been around long enough to qualify as “retro,” her use of it still became a major talking point. all your base (are) belong to us 👾 https://t.co/brwnkj8wrh — alexandria ocasio-cortez (@aoc) january 19, 2019 then on sunday, ocasio-cortez dropped into youtuber hbomberguy’s (aka harry brewis) twitch marathon of donkey kong 64, a fundraiser for transgender youth support group mermaids, to voice her support. speaking about discrimination against transgender people, ocasio-cortez said “it’s important that we do talk about these issues in the economic frame, but not let go of the fact that discrimination is a core reason for the economic hardship” (she also declared the nintendo 64 “probably the best system out of all of them”). here’s @aoc talking about how nintendo 64 was the best system. she’s on @twitch helping to raise money for trans kids. pic.twitter.com/cjifuif1mv — gene park (@genepark) january 20, 2019 ocasio-cortez, the congressional representative for new york’s 14th district in queens and the bronx, has also shown an adept understanding of how to satirize meme culture, turning it against itself even as she participates. this is something that any public figure who wants to own their own narrative and point of view must now be able to master. and democrats seem to understand this, since they asked her to lead a training session about social media). with @aoc, @repdebdingell, @jahimes, @davidcicilline, @repcartwright & @twitter representatives at training session on twitter for democratic members of congress. the below pic is called a selfie. pic.twitter.com/whwlqhxpoj — ted lieu (@tedlieu) january 17, 2019 her critics have credited ocasio-cortez’s ability to go viral as a result of her youth and appearance. that’s certainly a factor, which ocasio-cortez has addressed. but she has figured out how to use even that criticism to her advantage. when a fake nude selfie of ocasio-cortez was reposted by right-wing news site the daily caller, it was an attempt to turn meme culture (and her looks) against her, but the congresswoman instead flipped it into a discussion about misogyny against women leaders. for those out of the loop, republicans began to circulate a fake nude photo of me. the @dailycaller reposted it (!) and refused to indicate it was fake in the title as well. completely disgusting behavior from conservative outlets. no wonder they defended kavanaugh so fiercely. — alexandria ocasio-cortez (@aoc) january 10, 2019 an earlier attempt by twitter user anonymousq1776 to portray ocasio-cortez a “clueless nitwit” based on a video of her dancing in college also backfired by instead portraying her as, well, a typical college student. inspired by a scene in “the breakfast club,” the video itself was an example of an early (relatively speaking) internet meme, which itself triggered a discussion (and lawsuit) over copyright law and fair use rights, as noted by freedom of the press foundation director of special projects parker higgins. that tweet also, as you would guess from someone whose social media star is up high right now, launched the aoc dancing to every song meme. i hear the gop thinks women dancing are scandalous. wait till they find out congresswomen dance too! 💃🏽 have a great weekend everyone :) pic.twitter.com/9y6alow4f6 — alexandria ocasio-cortez (@aoc) january 4, 2019 but ocasio-cortez’s messages aren’t just for her political opponents. they also serve as a signal to people who have felt increasingly disenfranchised and scared over the last few years that the country’s problems, while profound, can be approached with intelligence and even some wry humor. a week after she was sworn into congress, tech investor vinod khosla casually dismissed her credentials, expressing doubt that she “understands basic economics, actual humans and technology.” this was a strange statement to make about someone who placed second in microbiology at the intel international science and engineering fair and earned a degree in international relations and economics at boston university. that is assuming she understands basic economics, actual humans and technology. i doubt if any of those are true. — vinod khosla (@vkhosla) january 12, 2019 “good at memes” might not look as impressive on a resume as her prize in one of the most prestigious research competitions for high school students (other alumni have gone on to win the nobel prize and national medal of science), but it shows that ocasio-cortez understands tech (and actual humans) on a level that her critics, including khosla, sorkin, and piers morgan, who admonished ocasio-cortez to start “acting like a grown-up not a juvenile smart-a**e,” are perhaps incapable of. ocasio-cortez has often been compared to trump because of their ability to control the narrative through social media, especially twitter. to cite another meme, however, trump is chaotic evil, acting on the urge of impulses he seems unable to control even as they profoundly affect the lives of vulnerable people. maybe it’s too early to tell exactly where ocasio-cortez’s political influence will fall on the d&d alignment chart, but it is anything but chaotic."
"delivery company doordash is announcing that it has raised $400 million in series f financing. earlier this month, the wall street journal reported that the company was looking to raise $500 million at a valuation of $6 billion or more. in fact, doordash now says the funding came at a $7.1 billion valuation. the round was led by temasek and dragoneer investment group, with participation from previous investors softbank vision fund, dst global, coatue management, gic, sequoia capital and y combinator. doordash has been raising money at an impressive rate, with a $535 million round last march followed by a $250 million round (valuing the company at $4 billion) in august. co-founder and ceo tony xu told me the round is “a reflection of superior performance over the past year.” apparently, the company is currently seeing 325 percent growth, year-over-year, and it points to recent data from second measure showing that the service has overtaken uber eats in u.s. market share for online food delivery — doordash now comes in second to grubhub. “i think the numbers speak for themselves,” xu said. “if you just run the math on doordash’s course and speed, we’re on track to be number one.” tony xu of doordash he attributed the company’s growth to three factors: its geographic reach (3,300 cities in the united states and canada), its selection of partners (not just restaurants — walmart is using doordash for grocery deliveries) and doordash drive, which allows businesses to use the doordash network to make their own deliveries. he added that doordash has been “growing in a disciplined way, turning markets towards profitability.” the funding, xu said, will allow the company to continue investing in drive, in its dashpass subscription service (where you pay $9.99 per month for free deliveries on orders of $15 or more from select restaurants) and in more hiring. and while doordash is currently available in all 50 states, xu said there’s still plenty of room to cover additional territory in the u.s. and especially canada. “to me, this round … really changes the position of the company, not only as we march towards market leadership, but as we go beyond restaurants and become the last mile for commerce,” he said. food delivery service postmates confidentially files to go public not all of doordash’s recent news has been good. along with instacart, the company has been under scrutiny for subsidizing its driver payments with customer tips. when asked about the criticism, xu said the current compensation system was tested “not in a quarter, not in a month, but tested for months” before being implemented in 2017, and since then, there’s been a “significant increase” in retention among “dashers,” along with improved dasher satisfaction and on-time deliveries. “when it comes to this pay model that has been in the press, the most important thing, i would say, is looking again at the facts and results,” he said."
"days after a youtube creator accused the platform of enabling a “soft-core pedophilia ring,” several companies have suspended advertising on the platform, including nestlé, epic and, reportedly, disney and mcdonald’s. nestlé told cnbc that all of its companies in the u.s. have paused advertising on youtube, while a spokesperson for epic, maker of the massively popular game fortnite, said it has suspended all pre-roll advertising. other companies that confirmed publicly they are pausing youtube advertising include purina, gnc, fairlife, canada goose and vitacost. bloomberg and the wall street journal report that walt disney co. and mcdonald’s, respectively, have pulled advertising, too. other advertisers, including peloton and grammarly, said they are calling on youtube to resolve the issue. the latest scandal over youtube’s content moderation problems took off on sunday when youtube creator matt watson posted a video and in-depth reddit post describing how pedophiles are able to manipulate the platform’s recommendation algorithm to redirect a search for “bikini haul” videos, featuring adult women, to exploitative clips of children. some otherwise innocuous videos also had inappropriate comments, including some with timestamps that captured children in compromising positions. a youtube spokesperson sent a statement to techcrunch that said “any content – including comments – that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on youtube. we took immediate action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to authorities and disabling comments on tens of millions of videos that include minors. there’s more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.” the platform has also reported comments to the national center for missing and exploited children and is taking further steps against child exploitation, including hiring more experts. watson’s report, however, highlights that youtube continues to struggle with content that violates its own policies, even after a series of reports two years ago led to what creators dubbed the “adpocalpyse.” in an effort to appease advertisers, youtube gave them more control over what videos their ads would appear before and also enacted more stringent policies for creators. many youtubers, however, have complained that the policies are unevenly enforced with little transparency, dramatically lowering their revenue but giving them little recourse to fix issues or appeal the platform’s decisions, even as objectionable content remains on the platform."
"u.s. ride-hailing giants lyft and uber are going public in the u.s. imminently, but in southeast asia, the two largest on-demand companies are still madly fueling up on investment capital. the latest update to that story today saw go-jek, the indonesian ride-hailing firm aiming to go regional in southeast asia, announce that it has pulled in $100 million from conglomerate astra, an existing investor, as part of the series f round it is raising right now. we know go-jek is aiming to bring in at least $2 billion from that round — and that it has closed around half of that capital — so the addition from astra is likely one of many that will take it toward that target. there’s also a strategic component to this deal. astra, for those who are not aware of it, is a $20 billion conglomerate that specializes in manufacturing, automotive and infrastructure industries. it plans to start a joint venture with go-jek to equip its cars with astra’s fleet management system to help improve the way go-jek manages its fleet and on-demand services. the rollout will start with “thousands” of go-car drivers. the capital is being raised to expand go-jek’s services in southeast asia. the company recently went official with the launch of its thailand-based get business. it has also expanded to vietnam and singapore over the last year and it is primed to offer its services in the philippines soon. grab, meanwhile, go-jek’s key adversary, recently raised $2 billion for its recent series h round. the company is working to extend that figure to $5 billion with a planned investment of up to $1.5 billion from softbank’s vision fund in the offing."
"ridesharing isn’t just for transporting teenagers and adults anymore. zūm, a ridesharing startup for kids, just raised a $40 million series c round led by bmw i ventures with participation from spark capital, sequoia capital and volvo cars tech fund. this brings the company’s total funding to $70 million. zūm is a mobile app that enables parents to schedule rides for their kids from fully vetted drivers. it also partners with school districts to support their transportation needs. to date, the company has partnered with 150 school districts across the country and transported more than 500,000 students. “zūm has proven itself as a force to be reckoned with in a market that has a lot of untapped opportunity,” bmw i ventures managing partner ulrich quay said in a statement. “its leadership is strong not only because of their drive to help working families, but because they themselves have families and understand the need for better child transportation, today. we’re proud to be supporting zūm and look forward to seeing its momentum as it continues driving funds back into schools.” the plan with the funding is to support the increase of partnerships with schools throughout the nation. additionally, zūm plans to use the funding to further develop its one-stop platform technology for schools. this platform features route optimization, vehicle and quality tracking and real-time vehicle dashboards for schools. “i’m honored to gain the support of our incredible investors who believe in what zūm does, and our mission to build the world’s largest and safest transportation service for students,” zūm founder and ceo ritu narayan (pictured above) said in a press release. “it is beyond exciting to have investors who have supported transportation, tech and marketplace startups across the globe, and to know they see in zūm what i’ve seen since the beginning—ineffective, inefficient school transportation is a massive issue and we need to build a better future for our children.” zūm, however, is not the only startup tackling transportation for kids. hopskipdrive, a rideshare service that picks up your kids, similarly partners with school districts for school bus alternatives. in 2017, hopskipdrive raised a $7.4 million round to bring its total funding to $21.5 million. there’s also kango, a more uber-like service for kids. however, you may recall shuddle’s shutdown of its uber-like service for kids in 2016. shuddle had raised $12.2 million prior to shutting down. perhaps partnering with schools and school districts is the way to go in this kid ride-hailing business."
"softbank’s vision fund is taking a bet on china’s auto market after it agreed to pour $1.5 billion into online car trading group chehaoduo, which literally means “many cars” in chinese. the beijing-based company operates two main sites — peer-to-peer online marketplace guazi for used vehicles, and maodou, which retails new sedans through direct sales and financial leasing. (these sub-brands are more subtly named; they translate to “sunflower seeds” and “edamame,” respectively.) chehaoduo said it will deploy the proceeds on technology investments as well as the development of new products and services. it also plans to ramp up its marketing efforts and continue to open brick-and-mortar stores, an omnichannel move it believes can enhance trust in consumers used to meeting dealers in person and differentiate it from peers with an exclusively online focus. chehaoduo currently runs 600 offline stores nationwide supporting new and used car dealing along with after-sales services. the sizable funding round arrived at a time when china’s softening economy is sapping consumer confidence, but the company’s two-pronged strategy makes sure it covers a broad range of consumer demands. new passenger car sales in china — the world’s largest auto market — fell for the first time since the 1990s to 23.7 million units last year, according to a report by china’s association of automobile manufacturers, the country’s top auto association. evs and online marketplaces thrive despite slump in chinese car sales on the other hand, used cars became a more economical choice in a consumer culture that, unlike many countries in the west, has been slow to embrace second-hand goods. but that mindset is shifting as people feel the heat of the chinese economic downturn: secondhand car sales were up 13 percent during the first 11 months of 2018, data from china’s automobile dealers association show. “china’s used car market is growing rapidly but online penetration remains low and auto financing is underutilized compared to developed markets. in just three years, chehaoduo group, through the guazi brand, has leveraged the latest innovations in data-driven technology to establish china’s leading car trading platform,” says eric chen, partner at softbank’s investment advisers, in a statement. the japanese investment group has been a prolific backer in the mobility industry through a variety of affiliated companies with vision fund being one. softbank’s massive portfolio includes the likes of uber, didi chuxing and grab . chehaoduo counts uxin and renrenche as its most serious rivals. uxin raised $225 million from a u.s. initial public offering last june while renrenche lured goldman sachs in a $300 million funding round last year that also saw participation from didi and tencent."
"slack, the provider of workplace communication and collaboration tools, has submitted paperwork with the securities and exchange commission to go public later this year, the company announced on monday. this is its first concrete step toward becoming a publicly listed company, five years after it launched. headquartered in san francisco, slack has raised more than $1 billion in venture capital investment, including a $427 million funding round in august. the round valued the business at $7.1 billion, cementing its position as one of the most valuable privately held businesses in the u.s. the company counted 10 million daily active users around the world and 85,000 paying users as of january 2019. according to data provided (via email) by sensortower, slack’s new users on mobile increased roughly 21 percent last quarter compared to q4 2017, while total installs on mobile grew 24 million. the company recorded 8 million installs in 2018, up 21 percent year-over-year. slack’s investors include softbank’s vision fund, dragoneer investment group, general atlantic, t. rowe price associates, wellington management, baillie gifford, social capital and ivp, as well as early investors accel and andreessen horowitz. slack is one of several tech unicorns on deck to go public this year. uber and lyft have both similarly filed confidentially to go public in what are expected to be traditional initial public offerings. slack, however, is expected to pursue a direct listing, following in spotify’s footsteps. instead of issuing new shares, slack will sell directly to the market existing shares held by insiders, employees and investors, a move that will allow it to bypass a roadshow and some of wall street’s exorbitant ipo fees. techcrunch conversations: direct listings"
"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here. 1. telegram gets 3m new signups during facebook apps’ outage in a message sent to his telegram channel, founder pavel durov wrote, “i see 3 million new users signed up for telegram within the last 24 hours.” durov doesn’t offer an explicit explanation for telegram’s sudden spike in signups, but he does take a thinly veiled swipe at social networking giant facebook. it’s probably not a coincidence that facebook and its related family of apps went down for most of wednesday. 2. google removed 2.3b bad ads, banned ads on 1.5m apps + 28m pages, plans new policy manager this year using both manual reviews and machine learning, google said that in 2018 it removed 2.3 billion “bad ads” that violated its policies — which at their most general forbid ads that mislead or exploit vulnerable people. 3. uber reportedly raising $1b in deal that values self-driving car unit at up to $10b uber is in negotiations with investors, including the softbank vision fund, to secure an investment as large as $1 billion for its autonomous vehicles unit. the deal would value the business at between $5 billion and $10 billion, according to a report from the wall street journal. 4. opportunity’s last mars panorama is a showstopper the opportunity mars rover may be officially offline for good, but its legacy of science and imagery is ongoing — and nasa just shared the last (nearly) complete panorama the robot sent back before it was blanketed in dust. 5. ai photo startup polarr raises an $11.5 million series a at the moment, polarr is probably best known for its photography app for ios and android, which utilizes machine learning and ai to improve image editing. the company says it has around four million monthly active users. 6. wework labs is launching a food tech accelerator wework is committing $1 million to back the first batch of companies. 7. facebook won’t store data in countries with human rights violations — except singapore when mark zuckerberg said in a lengthy blog post that facebook would not build data centers in countries with poor human rights, he chose to ignore singapore — known for a lack of privacy and freedom of expression."
"uber has said adamantly that it won’t exit india (or any more markets) following a hat-trick of retreats from china, russia and southeast asia, but does that include its food delivery business? the answer could well be yes. if media reports are right, uber is on the cusp of a tactical exit from india’s food delivery industry. india’s economic times is reporting that uber is in the final stages of a deal that would see swiggy, the food delivery service that recently raised $1 billion and expanded to general deliveries, eat up uber eats in india in exchange for giving the u.s. ride-hailing firm a 10 percent share of its business. swiggy was most recently said to be valued at $3.3 billion following that billion-dollar round, which was led by naspers and included new backers tencent and uber investor coatue. uber eats is touted as a major revenue generator for the company. the information previously reported that it grossed $1.5 billion in sales in the first quarter of 2018 alone, and the company has pushed expansion hard in asia. uber eats landed in india nearly two years ago but it finds itself in the middle of a dogfight between swiggy, which raised capital three times last year, and zomato, which is backed by alibaba. already, the battle has taken its toll on peripheral players that include foodpanda, the service acquired by uber rival ola in late 2017. ola is reported to have slashed costs at foodpanda and shifted the focus to a more sustainable cloud kitchen strategy. yet zomato and swiggy continue to be aggressive. based on that backdrop, and uber’s upcoming ipo, it would make sense to consolidate costs and yet retain a stake in the market. uber did exactly that through its exit deal with grab in southeast asia, which saw it hand over its transport and food delivery businesses in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in grab . that deal, which i argued was a win not a loss for uber, got the company out of an expensive subsidies war and gave it a stake in a growing business. it could well be a recipe that uber repeats for india’s food delivery space. note: the original version of this article was updated to note that coatue is an investor in both uber and swiggy."
"mark zuckerberg says it might be right for facebook to let people pay to not see ads, but that it would feel wrong to charge users for extra privacy controls. that’s just one of the fascinating philosophical views the ceo shared during the first of his public talks he’s promised as part of his 2019 personal challenge. talking to harvard law and computer science professor jonathan zittrain on the campus of the university he dropped out of, zuckerberg managed to escape the 100-minute conversation with just a few gaffes. at one point he said “we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations”. zittrain swiftly reminded him that’s exactly what facebook portal is, and zuckerberg tried to deflect by saying portal’s recordings would be encrypted. later zuckerberg mentioned “the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see” which is pretty sad and derisive assessment of the personal photos and status updates people share. and when he suggested crowdsourced fact-checking, zittrain chimed in that this could become an avenue for “astroturfing” where mobs of users provide purposefully biased information to promote their interests, like a political group’s supporting voting that their opponents’ facts are lies. while sometimes avoiding hard stances on questions, zuckerberg was otherwise relatively logical and coherent. policy and cooperating with governments the ceo touched on his borderline content policy that quietly demotes posts that come close to breaking its policy against nudity, hate speech etc that otherwise are the most sensational and get the most distribution but don’t make people feel good. zuckerberg noted some progress here, saying “a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that.” this aligns with zuckerberg contemplating facebook’s role as a “data fiduciary” where rather than necessarily giving in to users’ urges or prioritizing its short-term share price, the company tries to do what’s in the best long-term interest of its communities. “there’s a hard balance here which is — i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want” he said. essentially, people might tap on clickbait even if it doesn’t make them feel good. on working with governments, zuckerberg explained how incentives weren’t always aligned, like when law enforcement is monitoring someone accidentally dropping clues about their crimes and collaborators. the government and society might benefit from that continued surveillance but facebook might want to immediately suspend the account if it found out. “but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, ‘hey, this is where we’re at'”, implying facebook might purposefully allow that person to keep incriminating themselves to assist the authorities. but disagreements between governments can flare up, zuckerberg notes that “we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted.” that’s likely a reference to the 2016 arrest of facebook’s vp for latin amercia diego dzodan over whatsapp’s encryption preventing the company from providing evidence for a drug case. decentralizing facebook the tradeoffs of encryption and decentralization were a central theme. he discussed how while many people fear how encryption could mask illegal or offensive activity, facebook doesn’t have to peek at someone’s actual content to determine they’re violating policy. “one of the — i guess, somewhat surprising to me — findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content” zuckerberg said. with facebook rapidly building out a blockchain team to potentially launch a cryptocurrency for fee-less payments or an identity layer for decentralized applications, zittrain asked about the potential for letting users control which other apps they give their profile information to without facebook as an intermediary. san jose, ca – may 01: facebook ceo mark zuckerberg (photo by justin sullivan/getty images) zuckerberg stressed that at facebook’s scale, moving to a less efficient distributed architecture would be extremely “computationally intense” though it might eventually be possible. instead, he said “one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed.” this might be attractive to developers who would know facebook couldn’t cut them off from the users. the problem is that if a developer was abusing users, zuckerberg fears that “in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution?” no “pay for privacy” but perhaps most novel and urgent were zuckerberg’s comments on the secondary questions raised by where facebook should let people pay to remove ads. “you start getting into a principle question which is ‘are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people?’ and my answer to that is a hard no.” facebook has promised to always operate free version so everyone can have a voice. yet some including myself have suggested that a premium ad-free subscription to facebook could help ween it off maximizing data collection and engagement, though it might break facebook’s revenue machine by pulling the most affluent and desired users out of the ad targeting pool. “what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle” zuckerberg expands. “it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong.” back in may, zuckerberg announced facebook would build a clear history button in 2018 that deletes all the web browsing data the social network has collected about you, but that data’s deep integration into the company’s systems has delayed the launch. research suggests users don’t want the inconvenience of getting logged out of all their facebook connected services, though, they’d like to hide certain data from the company. “clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay.” of all the apologies, promises, and predictions zuckerberg has made recently, this pledge might instill the most confidence. while some might think of zuckerberg as a data tyrant out to absorb and exploit as much of our personal info as possible, there are at least lines he’s not willing to cross. facebook could try to charge you for privacy, but it won’t. and given facebook’s dominance in social networking and messaging plus zuckerberg’s voting control of the company, a greedier man could make the internet much worse. — transcript – mark zuckerberg at harvard / first personal challenge 2019 jonathan zittrain: very good. so, thank you, mark, for coming to talk to me and to our students from the techtopia program and from my “internet and society” course at harvard law school. we’re really pleased to have a chance to talk about any number of issues and we should just dive right in. so, privacy, autonomy, and information fiduciaries. mark zuckerberg: all right! jonathan zittrain: love to talk about that. mark zuckerberg: yeah! i read your piece in the new york times. jonathan zittrain: the one with the headline that said, “mark zuckerberg can fix this mess”? mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: although that was last year. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: that’s true! are you suggesting it’s all fixed? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no. no. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: okay, good. so– jonathan zittrain: i’m suggesting that i’m curious whether you still think that we can fix this mess? jonathan zittrain: ah! <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i hope– <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “hope springs eternal”– mark zuckerberg: yeah, there you go. jonathan zittrain: –is my motto. so, all right, let me give a quick characterization of this idea that the coinage and the scaffolding for it is from my colleague, jack balkin, at yale. and the two of us have been developing it out further. there are a standard number of privacy questions with which you might have some familiarity, having to do with people conveying information that they know they’re conveying or they’re not so sure they are, but “mouse droppings” as we used to call them when they run in the rafters of the internet and leave traces. and then the standard way of talking about that is you want to make sure that that stuff doesn’t go where you don’t want it to go. and we call that “informational privacy”. we don’t want people to know stuff that we want maybe our friends only to know. and on a place like facebook, you’re supposed to be able to tweak your settings and say, “give them to this and not to that.” but there’s also ways in which stuff that we share with consent could still sort of be used against us and it feels like, “well, you consented,” may not end the discussion. and the analogy that my colleague jack brought to bear was one of a doctor and a patient or a lawyer and a client or– sometimes in america, but not always– a financial advisor and a client that says that those professionals have certain expertise, they get trusted with all sorts of sensitive information from their clients and patients and, so, they have an extra duty to act in the interests of those clients even if their own interests conflict. and, so, maybe just one quick hypo to get us started. i wrote a piece in 2014, that maybe you read, that was a hypothetical about elections in which it said, “just hypothetically, imagine that facebook had a view about which candidate should win and they reminded people likely to vote for the favored candidate that it was election day,” and to others they simply sent a cat photo. would that be wrong? and i find– i have no idea if it’s illegal; it does seem wrong to me and it might be that the fiduciary approach captures what makes it wrong. mark zuckerberg: all right. so, i think we could probably spend the whole next hour just talking about that! <laughter> mark zuckerberg: so, i read your op-ed and i also read balkin’s blogpost on information fiduciaries. and i’ve had a conversation with him, too. jonathan zittrain: great. mark zuckerberg: and the– at first blush, kind of reading through this, my reaction is there’s a lot here that makes sense. right? the idea of us having a fiduciary relationship with the people who use our services is kind of intuitively– it’s how we think about how we’re building what we’re building. so, reading through this, it’s like, all right, you know, a lot of people seem to have this mistaken notion that when we’re putting together news feed and doing ranking that we have a team of people who are focused on maximizing the time that people spend, but that’s not the goal that we give them. we tell people on the team, “produce the service–” that we think is going to be the highest quality that– we try to ground it in kind of getting people to come in and tell us, right, of the content that we could potentially show what is going to be– they tell us what they want to see, then we build models that kind of– that can predict that, and build that service. jonathan zittrain: and, by the way, was that always the case or– mark zuckerberg: no. jonathan zittrain: –was that a place you got to through some course adjustments? mark zuckerberg: through course adjustments. i mean, you start off using simpler signals like what people are clicking on in feed, but then you pretty quickly learn, “hey, that gets you to local optimum,” right? where if you’re focusing on what people click on and predicting what people click on, then you select for click bait. right? so, pretty quickly you realize from real feedback, from real people, that’s not actually what people want. you’re not going to build the best service by doing that. so, you bring in people and actually have these panels of– we call it “getting to ground truth”– of you show people all the candidates for what can be shown to them and you have people say, “what’s the most meaningful thing that i wish that this system were showing us? so, all this is kind of a way of saying that our own self image of ourselves and what we’re doing is that we’re acting as fiduciaries and trying to build the best services for people. where i think that this ends up getting interesting is then the question of who gets to decide in the legal sense or the policy sense of what’s in people’s best interest? right? so, we come in every day and think, “hey, we’re building a service where we’re ranking newsfeed trying to show people the most relevant content with an assumption that’s backed by data; that, in general, people want us to show them the most relevant content. but, at some level, you could ask the question which is “who gets to decide that ranking newsfeed or showing relevant ads?” or any of the other things that we choose to work on are actually in people’s interest. and we’re doing the best that we can to try to build the services [ph?] that we think are the best. at the end of the day, a lot of this is grounded in “people choose to use it.” right? because, clearly, they’re getting some value from it. but then there are all these questions like you say about, you have– about where people can effectively give consent and not. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: so, i think that there’s a lot of interesting questions in this to unpack about how you’d implement a model like that. but, at a high level i think, you know, one of the things that i think about in terms of we’re running this big company; it’s important in society that people trust the institutions of society. clearly, i think we’re in a position now where people rightly have a lot of questions about big internet companies, facebook in particular, and i do think getting to a point there there’s the right regulation and rules in place just provides a kind of societal guardrail framework where people can have confidence that, okay, these companies are operating within a framework that we’ve all agreed. that’s better than them just doing whatever they want. and i think that that would give people confidence. so, figuring out what that framework is, i think, is a really important thing. and i’m sure we’ll talk about that as it relates– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –to a lot of the content areas today. but getting to that question of how do you– “who determines what’s in people’s best interest, if not people themselves?”jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –is a really interesting question. jonathan zittrain: yes, so, we should surely talk about that. so, on our agenda is the “who decides?” question. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: other agenda items include– just as you say, the fiduciary framework sounds nice to you– doctors, patients, facebook users. and i hear you saying that’s pretty much where you’re wanting to end up anyway. there are some interesting questions about what people want, versus what they want to want. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: people will say “on january 1st, what i want–” new year’s resolution– “is a gym membership.” and then on january 2nd, they don’t want to go to the gym. they want to want to go to the gym, but they never quite make it. and then, of course, a business model of pay for the whole year ahead of time and they know you’ll never turn up develops around that. and i guess a specific area to delve into for a moment on that might be on the advertising side of things, maybe the dichotomy between personalization and does it ever going into exploitation? now, there might be stuff– i know facebook, for example, bans payday loans as best it can. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that’s just a substantive area that it’s like, “all right, we don’t want to do that.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: but when we think about good personalization so that facebook knows i have a dog and not a cat, and a targeter can then offer me dog food and not cat food. how about, if not now, a future day in which an advertising platform can offer to an ad targeter some sense of “i just lost my pet, i’m really upset, i’m ready to make some snap decisions that i might regret later, but when i make them–“ mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: “–i’m going to make them.” so, this is the perfect time to tee up mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –a cubic zirconia or whatever the thing is that– . mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that seems to me a fiduciary approach would say, ideally– how we get there i don’t know, but ideally we wouldn’t permit that kind of approach to somebody using the information we’ve gleaned from them to know they’re in a tough spot– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and then to exploit them. but i don’t know. i don’t know how you would think about something like that. could you write an algorithm to detect something like that? mark zuckerberg: well, i think one of the key principles is that we’re trying to run this company for the long term. and i think that people think that a lot of things that– if you were just trying to optimize the profits for next quarter or something like that, you might want to do things that people might like in the near term, but over the long term will come to resent. but if you actually care about building a community and achieving this mission and building the company for the long term, i think you’re just much more aligned than people often think companies are. and it gets back to the idea before, where i think our self image is largely acting as– in this kind of fiduciary relationship as you’re saying– and across– we could probably go through a lot of different examples. i mean, we don’t want to show people content that they’re going to click on and engage with, but then feel like they wasted their time afterwards. where we don’t want to show them things that they’re going to make a decision based off of that and then regret later. i mean, there’s a hard balance here which is– i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want. so, i think there’s a question between when something is exploitative versus when something is real, but isn’t what you would say that you want. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s a really hard thing to get at. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but on a lot of these cases my experience of running the company is that you start off building a system, you have relatively unsophisticated signals to start, and you build up increasingly complex models over time that try to take into account more of what people care about. and there are all these examples that we can go through. i think probably newsfeed and ads are probably the two most complex ranking examples– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –that we have. but it’s– like we were talking about a second ago, when we started off with the systems, i mean, just start with newsfeeds– but you could do this on ads, too– you know, the most naïve signals, right, are what people click on or what people “like”. but then you just very quickly realize that that doesn’t– it approximates something, but it’s a very crude approximation of the ground truth of what people actually care about. so, what you really want to get to is as much as possible getting real people to look at the real candidates for content and tell you in a multi-dimensional way what matters to them and try to build systems that model that. and then you want to be kind of conservative on preventing downside. so, your example of the payday loans– and when we’ve talked about this in the past, your– you’ve put the question to me of “how do you know when a payday loan is going to be exploitative?” right? “if you’re targeting someone who is in a bad situation?” and our answer is, “well, we don’t really know when it’s going to be exploitative, but we think that the whole category potentially has a massive risk of that, so we just ban it– jonathan zittrain: right. which makes it an easy case. mark zuckerberg: yes. and i think that the harder cases are when there’s significant upside and significant downside and you want to weigh both of them. so, i mean, for example, once we started putting together a really big effort on preventing election interference, one of the initial ideas that came up was “why don’t we just ban all ads that relate to anything that is political?” and they you pretty quickly get into, all right, well, what’s a political ad? the classic legal definition is things that are around elections and candidates, but that’s not actually what russia and other folks were primarily doing. right? it’s– you know, a lot of the issues that we’ve seen are around issue ads, right, and basically sewing division on what are social issues. so, all right, i don’t think you’re going to get in the way of people’s speech and ability to promote and do advocacy on issues that they care about. so, then the question is “all right, well, so, then what’s the right balance?” of how do you make sure that you’re providing the right level of controls, that people who aren’t supposed to be participating in these debates aren’t or that at least you’re providing the right transparency. but i think we’ve veered a little bit from the original questionjonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –but the– but, yeah. so, let’s get back to where you were jonathan zittrain: well, here’s– and this is a way of maybe moving it forward, which is: a platform as complete as facebook is these days offers lots of opportunities to shape what people see and possibly to help them with those nudges, that it’s time to go to the gym or to avoid them from falling into the depredations of the payday loan. and it is a question of so long as the platform to do it, does it now have an ethical obligation to do it, to help people achieve the good life? mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and i worry that it is too great a burden for any company to bear to have to figure out, say, if not the perfect, the most reasonable newsfeed for every one of the– how many? two and a half billion active users? something like that. mark zuckerberg: yeah. on that order. jonathan zittrain: all the time and there might be some ways that start a little bit to get into the engineering of the thing that would say, “okay, with all hindsight, are there ways to architect this so that the stakes aren’t as high, aren’t as focused on just, “gosh, is facebook doing this right?” it’s as if there was only one newspaper in the whole world or one or two, and it’s like, “well, then what the new york times chooses to put on it’s home page, if it were the only newspaper, would have outsize importance.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: so, just as a technical matter, a number of the students in this room had a chance to hear from tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, and he has a new idea for something called “solid”. i don’t know if you’ve heard of solid. it’s a protocol more than it is a product. so, there’s no car to move off the lot today. but its idea is allowing people to have the data that they generate as they motor around the web end up in their own kind of data locker. now, for somebody like tim, it might mean literally in a locker under his desk and he could wake up in the middle of the night and see where his data is. for others, it might mean iraq somewhere, guarded perhaps by a fiduciary who’s looking out for them, the way that we put money in a bank and then we can sleep at night knowing the bankers are– this is maybe not the best analogy in 2019, but watching. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’ll get there. jonathan zittrain: we’ll get there. but solid says if you did that, people would then– or their helpful proxies– be able to say, “all right, facebook is coming along. it wants the following data from me and including that data that it has generated about me as i use it, but stored back in my locker and it kind of has to come back to my well to draw water each time. and that way if i want to switch to schmacebook or something, it’s still in my well and i can just immediately grant permission to schmacebook to see it and i don’t have to do a kind of data slurp and then re-upload it. it’s a fully distributed way of thinking about data. and i’m curious from an engineering perspective does this seem doable with something of the size and the number of spinning wheels that facebook has and does it seem like a mark zuckerberg: yeah– jonathan zittrain: –and i’m curious your reaction to an idea like that. mark zuckerberg: so, i think it’s quite interesting. certainly, the level of computation that facebook is doing and all the services that we’re building is really intense to do in a distributed way. i mean, i think as a basic model i think we’re building out the data center capacity over the next five years and our plan for what we think we need to do that we think is on the order of all of what aws and google cloud are doing for supporting all of their customers. so, okay, so, this is like a relatively computationally intense thing. over time you assume you’ll get more compute. so, decentralized things which are less efficient computationally will be harder– sorry, they’re harder to do computation on, but eventually maybe you have the compute resources to do that. i think the more interesting questions there are not feasibility in the near term, but are the philosophical questions of the goodness of a system like that. so, one question if you want to– so, we can get into decentralization, one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed. jonathan zittrain: “do you want to login with your facebook account?” is the status quo mark zuckerberg: basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice of whether to login to different places and you’re not going through an intermediary, which is kind of like what you’re suggesting here– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –in a sense. okay, now, there’s a lot of things that i think would be quite attractive about that. you know, for developers one of the things that is really troubling about working with our system, or google’s system for that matter, or having your services through apple’s app store, is that you don’t want to have an intermediary between serving your– the people who are using your service and you, right, where someone can just say, “hey, we as a developer have to follow your policy and if we don’t, then you can cut off access to the people we’re serving.” that’s kind of a difficult and troubling position to be in. i think developers– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: –you’re referring to a recent incident. mark zuckerberg: no, well, i was– well, sure<laughter> mark zuckerberg: but i think it underscores the– i think every developer probably feels this: people are using any app store but also login with facebook, with google; any of these services, you want a direct relationship with the people you serve. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: now, okay, but let’s look at the flip side. so, what we saw in the last couple of years with cambridge analytica, was basically an example where people chose to take data that they– some of it was their data, some of it was data that they had seen from their friends, right? because if you want to do things like making it so alternative services can build a competing newsfeed, then you need to be able to make it so that people can bring the data that they see you [ph?] within the system. okay, theybasically, people chose to give their data to a developer who’s affiliated with cambridge university, which is a really respected institution, and then that developer turned around and sold the data to the firm cambridge analytica, which is in violation of our policies. so, we cut off the developers’ access. and, of course, in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution? in some ways it’s a lot easier to regulate and hold accountable large companies like facebook or google, because they’re more visible, they’re more transparent than the long tail of services that people would chose to then go interact with directly. so, i think that this is a really interesting social question. to some degree i think this idea of going in the direction of blockchain authentication is less gated on the technology and capacity to do that. i think if you were doing fully decentralized facebook, that would take massive computation, but i’m sure we could do fully decentralized authentication if we wanted to. i think the real question is do you really want that? jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: right? and i think you’d have more cases where, yes, people would be able to not have an intermediary, but you’d also have more cases of abuse and the recourse would be much harder. jonathan zittrain: yes. what i hear you saying is people as they go about their business online are generating data about themselves that’s quite valuable, if not to themselves, to others who might interact with them. and the more they are empowered, possibly through a distributed system, to decide where that data goes, with whom they want to share it, the more they could be exposed to exploitation. this is a genuine dilemma– mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –because i’m a huge fan of decentralization. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: but i also see the problem. and maybe one answer is there’s some data that’s just so toxic there’s no vessel we should put it in; it might eat a whole through it or something, metaphorically speaking. but, then again, innocuous data can so quickly be assembled into something scary. so, i don’t know if the next election– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: yeah. [ph?] i mean, i think in general we’re talking about the large-scale of data being assembled into meaning something different from what the individual data points mean. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that’s the whole challenge here. but i philosophically agree with you thati mean, i want to think about the– like, i do think about the work that we’re doing as a decentralizing force in the world, right? a lot of the reason why i think people of my generation got into technology is because we believe that technology gives individuals power and isn’t massively centralizing. now you’ve built a bunch of big companies in the process, but i think what has largely happened is that individuals today have more voice, more ability to affiliate with who they want, and stay connected with people, ability to form communities in ways that they couldn’t before, and i think that’s massively empowering to individuals and that’s philosophically kind of the side that i tend to be on. so, that’s why i’m thinking about going back to decentralized or blockchain authentication. that’s why i’m kind of bouncing around how could you potentially make this work, because from my orientation is to try to go in that direction. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: an example where i think we’re generally a lot closer to going in that direction is encryption. i mean, this is, like, one of the really big debates today is basically what are the boundaries on where you would want a messaging service to be encrypted. and there are all these benefits from a privacy and security perspective, but, on the other hand, if what we’re trying to do– one of the big issues that we’re grappling with content governance and where is the line between free expression and, i suppose, privacy on one side, but safety on the other as people do really bad things, right, some of the time. and i think people rightfully have an expectation of us that we’re going to do everything we can to stop terrorists from recruiting people or people from exploiting children or doing different things. and moving in the direction of making these systems more encrypted certainly reduces some of the signals that we would have access to be able to do some of that really important work. but here we are, right, we’re sitting in this position where we’re running whatsapp, which is the largest end-to-end encrypting service in the world; we’re running messenger, which is another one of the largest messaging systems in the world where encryption is an option, but it isn’t the default. i don’t think long term it really makes sense to be running different systems with very different policies on this. i think this is sort of a philosophical question where you want to figure out where you want to be on it. and, so, my question for you– now, i’ll talk about how i’m thinking about this– is all right, if you were in my position and you got to flip a switch is probably too glib, because there’s a lot of work that goes into this, and go in one direction for both of those services, who would you think about that? jonathan zittrain: well, the question you’re putting on the table, which is a hard one is “is it okay,” and let’s just take the simple case, “for two people to communicate with each other in a way that makes it difficult for any third party to casually listen in?” is that okay? and i think that the way we normally answer that question is kind of a form of what you might call status quo-ism, which is not satisfying. it’s whatever has been the case is— mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –whatever has been the case is what should stay the case. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and, so, for whatsapp, it’s like right now whatsapp, as i understand it, you could correct me if i’m wrong, is pretty hard to get into if– mark zuckerberg: it’s fully end-to-end encrypted. jonathan zittrain: right. so, if facebook gets handed a subpoena or a warrant or something from name-your-favorite-country– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and you’re just like, “thank you for playing. we have nothing to–” <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted. jonathan zittrain: yes. and then, on the other hand, and this is not as clean as it could be in theory, but messenger is sometimes encrypted, sometimes not. if it doesn’t happen to have been encrypted by the users, then that subpoena could work and, more than that, there could start to be some automated systems either on facebook’s own initiative or under pressure from governments in the general case, not a specific warrant, to say, “hey, if the following phrases appear, if there’s some telltale that says, “this is somebody going after a kid for exploitation,” it should be forwarded up. if that’s already happening and we can produce x-number of people who have been identified and a number of crimes averted that way, who wants to be the person to be like, “lock it down!” like, “we don’t want any more of that!” but i guess, to put myself now to your question, when i look out over years rather than just weeks or months, the ability to casually peek at any conversation going on between two people or among a small group of people or even to have a machine do it for you, so, you can just set your alert list, you know, crudely speaking, and get stuff back, that– it’s always trite to call something orwellian, but it makes orwell look like a piker. i mean, it seems like a classic case where you– the next sentence would be “what could possible go wrong?” jonathan zittrain: and we can fill that in! and it does mean, though, i think that we have to confront the fact that if we choose to allow that kind of communication, then there’s going to be crimes unsolved that could’ve been solved. there’s going to be crimes not prevented that could have been prevented. and the only thing that kind of blunts it a little is it is not really all or nothing. the modern surveillance states of note in the world, have a lot of arrows in their quivers. and just being able to darken you door and demand surveillance of a certain kind, that might be a first thing they would go to, but they’ve got a plan b, and plan c, and a plan d. and i guess it really gets to what’s your threat model? if you think everybody is kind of a threat, think about the battles of copyright 15 years ago. everybody is a potential infringer. all they have to do is fire up napster, then you’re wanting some massive technical infrastructure to prevent the bad thing. if what you’re thinking is instead, they are a few really bad apples and they tend to– when they congregate online or otherwise with one another– tend to identify themselves and then we might have to send somebody near their house to listen with a cup at the window, metaphorically speaking. that’s a different threat model and [sic] might not need it. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: is that getting to an answer to your question? mark zuckerberg: yeah, and i think i generally agree. i mean, i’ve already said publically that my inclination is to move these services in the direction of being all encrypted, at least the private communication version. i basically think if you want to kind of talk in metaphors, messaging is like people’s living room, right? and i think we– you know, we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations. jonathan zittrain: even as we’re now– i mean, it is 2019, people are happily are putting cameras in their living rooms. mark zuckerberg: that’s their choice, but i guess they’re putting cameras in their living rooms, well, for a number of reasons, but– jonathan zittrain: and facebook has a camera that you can go into your living room- <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that is, i guess– jonathan zittrain: i just want to be clear. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: yeah, although that would be encrypted in this world. jonathan zittrain: encrypted between you and facebook! mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. i think– but it also– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: doesn’t it have like a little alexa functionality, too? mark zuckerberg: well, portal works over messenger. so, if we go towards encryption on messenger, then that’ll be fully encrypted, which i think, frankly, is probably what people want. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: the other model, beside the living room is the town square and that, i think, just has different social norms and different policies and norms that should be at play around that. but i do think that these things are very different. right? you’re not going to– you may end up in a world where the town square is a fully decentralized or fully encrypted thing, but it’s not clear what value there is in encrypting something that’s public content anyway, or very broad. jonathan zittrain: but, now, you were put to it pretty hard in that as i understand it there’s now a change to how whatsapp works, that there’s only five forwards permitted. mark zuckerberg: yeah, so, this is a really interesting point, right? so, when people talk about how encryption will darken some of the signals that we’ll be able to use, you know, both for potentially providing better services and for preventing harm. one of the– i guess, somewhat surprising to me, findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content. jonathan zittrain: so-called meta data. mark zuckerberg: sure. jonathan zittrain: “i don’t know what they’re saying, but here’s who’s they’re calling” kind of thing. mark zuckerberg: yeah, or just like they– this account doesn’t seem to really act like a person, right? and i guess as ai gets more advanced and you build these adversarial networks or generalized adversarial networks, you’ll get to a place where you have ai that can probably more effectively jonathan zittrain: go under mimic [ph?] cover. mimic act like another person– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: –for a while. mark zuckerberg: yeah. but, at the same time, you’ll be building up contrary ai on the other side, but is better at identifying ais that are doing that. but this has certainly been the most effective tactic across a lot of the areas where we’ve needed to focus to preventing harm. you know, the ability to identify fake accounts, which, like, a huge amount of the– under any category of issue that you’re talking about, a lot of the issues downstream come from fake accounts or people who are clearly acting in some malicious or not normal way. you can identify a lot of that without necessarily even looking at the content itself. and if you have to look at a piece of content, then in some cases, you’re already late, because the content exists and the activity has already happened. so, that’s one of the things that makes me feel like encryption for these messaging services is really the right direction to go, because you’re– it’s a very proprivacy and per security move to give people that control and assurance and i’m relatively confident that even though you are losing some tools to– on the finding harmful content side of the ledger, i don’t think at the end of the day that those are going to end up being the most important tools jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –for finding the most of the– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: but now connect it up quickly to the five forwards thing. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, sure. so, that gets down to if you’re not operating on a piece of content directly, you need to operate on patterns of behavior in the network. and what we, basically found was there weren’t that many good uses for people forwarding things more than five times except to basically spam or blast stuff off. it was being disproportionately abused. so, you end up thinking about different tactics when you’re not operating on content specifically; you end up thinking about patterns of usage more. jonathan zittrain: well, spam, i get and that– i’m always in favor of things that reduce spam. however, you could also say the second category was just to spread content. you could have the classic, i don’t know, like les mis, or paul revere’s ride, or arab spring-esque in the romanticized vision of it: “gosh, this is a way for people to do a tree,” and pass along a message that “you can’t stop the signal,” to use a joss whedon reference. you really want to get the word out. this would obviously stop that, too. mark zuckerberg: yeah, and then i think the question is you’re just weighing whether you want this private communication tool where the vast majority of the use and the reason why it was designed was the vast majority of just one-on-one; there’s a large amount of groups that people communicate into, but it’s a pretty small edge case of people operating this with, like– you have a lot of different groups and you’re trying to organize something and almost hack public content-type or public sharing- type utility into an encrypted space and, again, there i think you start getting into “is this the living room or is this the town square?” and when people start trying to use tools that are designed for one thing to get around what i think the social norms are for the town square, that’s when i think you probably start to have some issues. this is not– we’re not done addressing these issues. there’s a lot more to think through on this jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: –but that’s the general shape of the problem that at least i perceive from the work that we’re doing. jonathan zittrain: well, without any particular segue, let’s talk about fake news. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, insert your favorite segue here. there’s some choice or at least some decision that gets made to figure out what’s going to be next in my newsfeed when i scroll up a little more. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and in the last conversation bit, we were talking about how much we’re looking at content versus telltales and metadata, things that surround the content. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for knowing about what that next thing in the newsfeed should be, is it a valid desirable material consideration, do you think, for a platform like facebook to say is the thing we are about to present true, whatever true means? mark zuckerberg: well, yes, because, again, getting at trying to serve people, people tell us that they don’t want fake content. right. i mean, i don’t know anyone who wants fake content. i think the whole issue is, again, who gets to decide. right. so broadly speaking, i don’t know any individual who would sit there and say, “yes, please show me things that you know are false and that are fake.” people want good quality content and information. that said, i don’t really think that people want us to be deciding what is true for them and people disagree on what is true. and, like, truth is, i mean, there are different levels of when someone is telling a story, maybe the meta arc is talking about something that is true but the facts that were used in it are wrong in some nuanced way but, like, it speaks to some deeper experience. well, was that true or not? and do people want that disqualified from to them? i think different people are going to come to different places on this. now, so i’ve been very sensitive, which, on, like, we really want to make sure that we’re showing people high quality content and information. we know that people don’t want false information. so we’re building quite advanced systems to be able to– to make sure that we’re emphasizing and showing stuff that is going to be high quality. but the big question is where do you get the signal on what the quality is? so the kind of initial v.1 of this was working with third party fact checkers. right, i believe very strongly that people do not want facebook and that we should not be the arbiters of truth in deciding what is correct for everyone in the society. i think people already generally think that we have too much power in deciding what content is good. i tend to also be concerned about that and we should talk about some of the governance stuff that we’re working on separately to try to make it so that we can bring more independent oversight into that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but let’s put that in a box for now and just say that with those concerns in mind, i’m definitely not looking to try to take on a lot more in terms of also deciding in addition to enforcing all the content policies, also deciding what is true for everyone in the world. okay, so v.1 of that is we’re going to work with– jonathan zittrain: truth experts. mark zuckerberg: we’re working with fact checkers. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: and, and they’re experts and basically, there’s like a whole field of how you go and assess certain content. they’re accredited. people can disagree with the leaning of some of these organizations. jonathan zittrain: <laughter> who does accredited fact checkers? mark zuckerberg: <laughs> the poynter institute for journalism. jonathan zittrain: i should apply for my certification. mark zuckerberg: you may. jonathan zittrain: okay, good. mark zuckerberg: you’d probably get it, but you have to– you’d have to go through the process. mark zuckerberg: the issue there is there aren’t enough of them, right. so there’s a large content. there’s obviously a lot of information is shared every day and there just aren’t a lot of fact checkers. so then the question is okay, that is probably jonathan zittrain: but the portion– you’re saying the food is good, it’s just the portions are small. but the food is good. mark zuckerberg: i think in general, but so you build systems, which is what we’ve done especially leading up to elections where i think are some of the most fraught times around this where people really are aggressively trying to spread misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: you build systems that prioritize content that seems like it’s going viral because you want to reduce the prevalence of how widespread the stuff gets, so that way the fact checkers have tools to be able to, like, prioritize what they need to go– what they need to go look at. but it’s still getting to a relatively small percent of the content. so i think the real thing that we want to try to get to over time is more of a crowd sourced model where people, it’s not that people are trusting some sort, some basic set of experts who are accredited but are in some kid of lofty institution somewhere else. it’s like do you trust, yeah, like, if you get enough data points from within the community of people reasonably looking at something and assessing it over time, then the question is can you compound that together into something that is a strong enough signal that we can then use that? jonathan zittrain: kind of in the old school like a slash-dot moderating system mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: with only the worry that if the stakes get high enough, somebody wants to astroturf that. mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: i’d be– mark zuckerberg: there are a lot of questions here, which is why i’m not sitting here and announcing a new program. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: but what i’m saying is this is, like,– jonathan zittrain: yeah, mark zuckerberg: this is the general direction that i think we should be thinking about when we haveand i think that there’s a lot of questions and– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and we’d like to run some tests in this area to see whether this can help out. which would be upholding the principles which are that we want to stop– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: the spread of misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: knowing that no one wants misinformation. and the other principle, which is that we do not want to be arbiters of truth. jonathan zittrain: want to be the decider, yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that that’s the basic– those are the basic contours i think of that, of that problem. jonathan zittrain: so let me run an idea by you that you can process in real time and tell me the eight reasons i have not thought of why this is a terrible idea. and that would be people see something in their facebook feed. they’re about to share it out because it’s got a kind of outrage factor to it. i think of the classic story from two years ago in the denver guardian about “fbi agent suspected in hilary clinton email leak implicated in murder-suicide.” i have just uttered fake news. none of that was true if you clicked through the denver guardian. there was just that article. there is denver guardian. if you live in denver, you cannot subscribe. like, it is unambiguously fake. and it was shared more times than the most shared story during the election season of the boston globe. and so mark zuckerberg: so, and this is actually an example, by the way, of where trying to figure out fake accounts is a much simpler solution. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: than trying to down– jonathan zittrain: so if newspaper has one article– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: wait for ten more before you decide they’re a newspaper. mark zuckerberg: yeah. or, you know, i mean, it’s there are any number of systems that you could build to basically detect, “hey, this is–” jonathan zittrain: a potemkin. mark zuckerberg: this is a fraudulent thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and then you can take that down. and again, that ends up being a much less controversial decision because you’re doing it upstream based on the basis of inauthenticity. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: in a system where people are supposed to be their real and represent that they’re their real selves than downstream, trying to say, “hey, is this true or false?” jonathan zittrain: i made a mistake in giving you the easy case. mark zuckerberg: okay. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so i should have not used that example. mark zuckerberg: too simple. jonathan zittrain: you’re right and you knocked that one out of the park and, like, denver guardian, come up with more articles and be real and then come back and talk to us. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, here’s the harder case which is something that might be in an outlet that is, you know, viewed as legitimate, has a number of users, et cetera. so you can’t use the metadata as easily. imagine if somebody as they shared it out could say, “by the way, i want to follow this. i want to learn a little bit more about this.” they click a button that says that. and i also realized when i talked earlier to somebody at facebook on this that adding a new button to the homepage is, like, everybody’s first idea mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah. jonathan zittrain: and it’s– mark zuckerberg: but it’s a reasonable thought experiment, even though it would lead to a very bad ui. jonathan zittrain: fair enough. i understand this is already– mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughs> jonathan zittrain: in the land of fantasy. so they add the button. they say, “i want to follow up on this.” if enough people are clicking comparatively on the same thing to say, “i want to learn more about this. if anything else develops, let me know, facebook,” that, then, if i have my pneumatic tube, it then goes to a convened virtually panel of three librarians. we go to the librarians of the nation and the world at public and private libraries across the land who agree to participate in this program. maybe we set up a little foundation for it that’s endowed permanently and no long connected to whoever endowed it. and those librarians together discuss the piece and they come back with what they would tell a patron if somebody came up to them and said, “i’m about to cite this in my social studies paper. what do you think?” and librarians, like, live for questions like that. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm, yeah. jonathan zittrain: they’re like, “wow. let us tell you.” and they have a huge fiduciary notion of patron duty that says, “i may disapprove of you even studying this, whatever, but i’m here to serve you, the user.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: “and i just think you should know, this is why maybe it’s not such a good source.” and when they come up with that they can send it back and it gets pushed out to everybody who asks for follow-up– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and they can do with it as they will. and last piece of the puzzle, we have high school students who apprentice as librarian number three for credit. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and then they can get graded on how well they participated in this exercise which helps generate a new generation of librarian-themed people who are better off at reading things, so. mark zuckerberg: all right, well, i think you have a side goal here which i haven’t been thinking about on the librarian thing. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: which is the evil goal of promoting libraries. jonathan zittrain: well, it’s mark zuckerberg: no, but i mean, look, i think solving– preventing misinformation or spreading misinformation is hard enough without also trying to develop high school students in a direction. jonathan zittrain: ah. my colleague charlies foote– mark zuckerberg: so, that’s solving a problem with a problem. jonathan zittrain: all right. well, anyway, yes. mark zuckerberg: so i actually think i agree with most of what you have in there. it doesn’t need to be a button on the home page, it can be– i mean, it turns out that there’s so many people using these services that even if you get– even if you put something that looks like it’s not super prominent, like, behind the three dots on a given newsfeed story, you have the options, yeah, you’re not– not everyone is going tois going to like something. jonathan zittrain: if 1 out of 1000 do it, you still get 10,000 or 100,000 people, yeah. mark zuckerberg: you get pretty good signal. but i actually think you could do even better, which is, it’s not even clear that you need that signal. i think that that’s super helpful. i think really what matters is looking at stuff that’s getting a lot of distribution. so, you know, i think that there’s kind of this notion, and i’m going back to the encryption conversation, which is all right, if i say something that’s wrong to you in a one-on-one conversation, i mean, does that need to be fact checked? i mean, it’s, yeah, it would be good if you got the most accurate information. jonathan zittrain: i do have a personal librarian to accompany me for most conversations, yes. there you go. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: well, you are– jonathan zittrain: unusual. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. yes. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that’s the word i was looking for. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i’m not sure i believe you, but yes. mark zuckerberg: it’s– <laughs> but i think that there’s limited– i don’t think anyone would say that every message that goes back and forth in especially an encrypted messaging service should be jonathan zittrain: fact checked. mark zuckerberg: should be fact checked. jonathan zittrain: correct. mark zuckerberg: so i think the real question is all right, when something starts going viral or getting a lot of distribution, that’s when it becomes most socially important for it to be– have some level of validation or at least that we know where that the community in general thinks that this is a reasonable thing. so it’s actually, while it’s helpful to have the signal of whether people are flagging this as something that we should look at, i actually think increasingly you want to be designing systems that just prevent like alarming or sensational content from going viral in the first place. and making sure that that, that the stuff that is getting wide distribution is doing so because it’s high quality on whatever front you care about. so then, okay– jonathan zittrain: and that quality is still generally from poynter or some external party that mark zuckerberg: well, well quality has many dimensions. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but certainly accuracy is one dimension of it. you also, i mean, you pointed out i think in one of your questions, is this piece of content prone to incite outrage. if you don’t mind, i’ll get to your panel of three things in a second, but as a slight detour on this. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: one of the findings that has been quite interesting is, you know, there’s this question about whether social media in general increases, basically makes it so that sensationalist content gets the most distribution. and what we’ve found is that, all right, so we’re going to have rules, right, about what content is allowed. and what we found is that generally within whatever rules you set up, as content approaches the line of what is allowed, it often gets more distribution. so if you’ll have some rule on, you know, what– and take a completely different example and our nudity policies. right. it’s like, okay, you have to define what is unacceptable nudity in some way. as you get as close to that as possible it’s like, all right. like, this is maybe a photo of someone– jonathan zittrain: the skin to share ratio goes up until it gets banned at which point it goes to zero. mark zuckerberg: yes. okay. so that is a bad property of a system, right, that i think you want to generally address. or you don’t want to design a community where or systems for helping to build a community where things that get as close to the line as what is bad get the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so long as we have the premise, which in many cases is true, but i could probably try to think of some where it wouldn’t be true, that as you near the line, you are getting worse. mark zuckerberg: that’s a good point. that’s a good point. there’s– jonathan zittrain: you know, there might be humor that’s really edgy. mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: and that conveys a message that would be impossible to convey without the edginess, while not still– mark zuckerberg: that is– jonathan zittrain: but, i– mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so but then you get the question of what’s the cost benefit of allowing that. and obviously, where you can accurately separate what’s good and bad which you, like in the case of misinformation i’m not sure you could do it fully accurately, but you can try to build systems that approximate that, there’s certainly the issue, which is that, i mean, there is misinformation which leads to massive public harm, right. so if it’s misinformation that is also spreading hate and leading to genocide or public attacks or, it’s like, okay, we’re not going to allow that. right. that’s coming down. but then generally if you say something that’s wrong, we’re not going to try to block that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: we’re just going to try to not show it to people widely because people don’t want content that is wrong. so then the question is as something is approaching the line, how do you assess that? this is a general theme in a lot of the content governance and enforcement work that we’re doing, which is there’s one piece of this which is just making sure that we can as effectively as possible enforce the policies that exist. then there’s a whole other stream of work, which i called borderline content, which is basically this issue of as content approaches the line of being against the policies, how do you make sure that that isn’t the content that is somehow getting the most distribution? and a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that. jonathan zittrain: so this idea would be stuff that you’re kind of letting down easy without banning and letting down easy as it’s going to somehow have a coefficient of friction for sharing that goes up. it’s going to be harder– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for it to go viral. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and– mark zuckerberg: so it’s fascinating because it’s just against– like, you can take almost any category of policy that we have, so i used nudity a second ago. you know, gore and violent imagery. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: hate speech. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: any of these things. i mean, there’s, like, hate speech, there’s content that you would just say is mean or toxic, but that did not violate– but that you would not want to have a society that banned being able to say that thing. but it’s, but you don’t necessarily want that to be the content that is getting the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so here’s a classic transparency question around exactly that system you described. and when you described this, i think you did a post around this a few months ago. this was fascinating. you had graphs in the post depicting this, which was great. how would you feel about sharing back to the person who posted or possibly to everybody who encounters it its coefficient of friction? would that freak people out? would it be, like, all right, i– and in fact, they would then probably start conforming their posts, for better or worse,– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: to try to maximize the sharability. but that rating is already somewhere in there by design. would it be okay to surface it? mark zuckerberg: so, as a principle, i think that that would be good, but i don’t– the way that the systems are designed isn’t that you get a score of how inflammatory or sensationalist a piece of content is. the way that it basically works is you can build classifiers that identify specific types of things. right. so we’re going down the list of, like, all right, there’s 20 categories of harmful content that you’re trying to identify. you know, everything from terrorist propaganda on the one hand to self-harm issues to hate speech and election interference. and basically, each of these things while it uses a lot of the same underlying machine learning infrastructure, you’re doing specific work for each of them. so if you go back to the example on nudity for a second, you know, what you– you’re not necessarily scoring everything on a scale of not at all nude to nude. you[‘re basically enforcing specific policies. so, you know, you’re saying, “okay, if–” jonathan zittrain: so by machine learning it would just be give me an estimate of the odds by which if a human looked at it who was employed to enforce policy– mark zuckerberg: well, basically– jonathan zittrain: whether it violates the policy. mark zuckerberg: and you have a sense of, okay, this is– so what are the things that are adjacent to the policy, right? so you night say, okay, well, if the person is completely naked, that is something that you can definitely build a classifier to be able to identify with relatively high accuracy. but even if they’re not, you know, then the question is you kind of need to be able to qualitatively describe what are the things that are adjacent to that. so maybe the person is wearing a bathing suit and is in a sexually suggestive position. right. it’s not like any piece of content you’re going to score from not at all nude to nude. but you kind of have the cases for what you think are adjacent to the issues and, and again, you ground this and qualitatively, people, like, people might click on it, they might engage with it, but at the end, they don’t necessarily feel good about it. and you want to get at when you’re designing these systems not just what people do, but also you want to make sure we factor in, too, like is this the content that people say that they really want to be seeing? do they–? jonathan zittrain: the constitutional law, there’s a formal kind of definition that’s emerged for the word “prurient.” if something appeals to the prurient interest– mark zuckerberg: okay. jonathan zittrain: as part of a definition of obscenity, the famous miller test, which was not a beeroriented test. and part of a prurient interest is basically it excites me and yet it completely disgusts me. and it sounds like you’re actually converging to the supreme court’s vision of prurience with this. mark zuckerberg: maybe. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and it might be– don’t worry, i’m not trying to nail you down on that. but it’s very interesting that machine learning, which you invoked, is both really good, i gather, at something like this. it’s the kind of thing that’s like just have some people tell me with their expertise, does this come near to violating the policy or not and i’ll just through a spidey sense start to tell you whether it would. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm. jonathan zittrain: rather than being able to throw out exactly what the factors are. i know the person’s fully clothed, but it still is going to invoke that quality. so all of the benefits of machine learning and all of, of course, all the drawbacks where it classifies something and somebody’s like, “wait a minute. that was me doing a parody of blah, blah, blah.” that all comes to the fore. mark zuckerberg: yeah and i mean, when you ask people what they want to see in addition to looking at what they actually engage with, you do get a completely different sense of what people value and you can build systems that approximate that. but going back to your question, i think rather than giving people a score of the friction– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i think you can probably give people feedback of, “hey, this might make people uncomfortable in this way, in this specific way.” and this fits your– jonathan zittrain: it might affect how much it gets– how much it gets shared. mark zuckerberg: yeah. and this gets down to a different– there’s a different ai ethics question which i think is really important here, which is designing ai systems to be understandable by people jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: right and to some degree, you don’t just want it to spit out a score of how offensive or, like, where it scores on any given policy. you want it to be able to map to specific things that might be problematic. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s the way that we’re trying to design the systems overall. jonathan zittrain: yes. now we have something parked in the box we should take out, which is the external review stuff. but before we do, one other just transparency thing maybe to broach. it basically just occurred to me, i imagine it might be possible to issue me a score of how much i’ve earned for facebook this year. it could simply say, “this is how much we collected on the basis of you in particular being exposed to an ad.” <laughs> and i know sometimes people, i guess, might compete to get their numbers up. <laughs> but i’m just curious, would that be a figure? i’d kind of be curious to know, in part because it might even lay the groundwork of being like, “look, mark, i’ll double it. you can have double the money and then don’t show me any ads.” can we get a car off of that lot today? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: <laughs> okay, well, there’s a lot– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: there’s a lot in there. jonathan zittrain: it was a quick question. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> so there’s a question in what you’re saying which is so we built an ad-supported system. should we have an option for people to pay to not see ads. jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: i think is kind of what you’re saying. i mean, just as the basic primer from first principles on this. you know, we’re building this service. we want to give everyone a voice. we want everyone to be able to connect with who they care about. if you’re trying to build a service for everyone, jonathan zittrain: got to be free. that’s just <inaudible 01:04:45> mark zuckerberg: if you want them to use it, that’s just going to be the argument. yes, yes. jonathan zittrain: okay. all right. mark zuckerberg: so then, so this is a kind of a tried and true thing. there are a lot of companies over time that have been ad supported. in general what we find is that if people are going to see ads, they want them to be relevant. they don’t want them to be junk. right. so then within that you give people control over how their data is used to show them ads. but the vast majority of people say, like, show me the most relevant ads that you can because i get that i have to see ads. this is a free service. so now the question is, all right, so there’s a whole set of questions around that that we could get into, but but then jonathan zittrain: for which we did talk about enough to reopen it, the personalization exploitation. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: or even just philosophical question. right now, uber or lyft are not funded that way. we could apply this ad model to uber or lyft, “free rides. totally free. it’s just every fifth ride takes you to wendy’s and idles outside the drive through window.” <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “totally up to you what you want to do, but you’re going to sit here for a while,” and then you go on your way. i don’t know how– and status quo-ism would probably say people would have a problem with that, but it would give people rides that otherwise wouldn’t get rides. mark zuckerberg: i have not thought about that case in their– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: in their business, so, so– jonathan zittrain: well, that’s my patent, damn it, so don’t you steal it. mark zuckerberg: but certainly some services, i think tend themselves better towards being ad supported than others. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: okay and i think generally information-based ones tend to– jonathan zittrain: than my false imprisonment hypo, i’d– okay, fair enough. mark zuckerberg: i mean, that seems jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: there might be, you know, more– <laughs> more issues there. but okay, but go to the subscription thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: when people have questions about the ad model on facebook, i don’t think the questions are just about the ad model, i think they’re about both seeing ads and data use around ads. and the thing that i think, so when i think about this it’s, i don’t just think you want to let people pay to not see ads because i actually think then the question is the questions are around ads and data use and i don’t think people are going to be that psyched about not seeing ads but then not having different controls over how their data is used. okay, but now you start getting into a principle question which is are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people. and my answer to that is a hard no, right. so the prerequisite– jonathan zittrain: what’s an example of data use that isn’t ad-based, just so we know what we’re talking about? mark zuckerberg: that isn’t ad-based? jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: like what do you mean? jonathan zittrain: you were saying, i don’t want to see ads. but you’re saying that’s kind of just the wax on the car. what’s underneath is how the data gets used. mark zuckerberg: so, well, look– maybe– let me keep going with this explanation and then i think this’ll be clear. jonathan zittrain: yeah, sure. mark zuckerberg: so one of the things that we’ve been working on is this tool that we call clear history. and the basic idea is it is you can kind of analogize it to a web browser where you can clear your cookies. that’s kind of a normal thing. you know that when you clear your cookies you’re going to get logged out of a bunch of stuff. a bunch of stuff might get more annoying. jonathan zittrain: which is why my guess is, am i right, probably nobody clears their cookies. mark zuckerberg: i don’t know. jonathan zittrain: they might use incognito mode or something, but. mark zuckerberg: i think– i don’t know. how many of you guys clear your cookies every once in a while, right? jonathan zittrain: this is not a representative group, damn it. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. like, maybe once a year or something i’ll clear my cookies. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but no, it’s, i think– jonathan zittrain: happy new year. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, over some period of time, all right, but– jonathan zittrain: yeah, okay. mark zuckerberg: but not necessarily every day. but it’s important that people have that tool even though it might in a local sense make their experience worse. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: okay. so that kind of content of what different services, websites and apps send to facebook that, you know, we use to help measure the ads in effectiveness there, right, so things like, you know, if you’re an app developer and you’re trying to pay for ads to help grow your app, we want to only charge you when we actually, when something that we show leads to an install, not just whether someone sees the ad or clicks on it, but if they add– jonathan zittrain: that requires a whole infrastructure to, yeah. mark zuckerberg: okay, so then, yeah, so you build that out. it helps us show people more relevant ads. it can help show more relevant content. often a lot of these signals are super useful also on the security side for some of the other things that we’ve talked about, so that ends up being important. but fundamentally, you know, looking at the model today, it seems like you should have something like this ability to clear history. it turns out that it’s a much more complex technical project. i’d talked about this at our developer conference last year, about how i’d hoped that we’d roll it out by the end of 2018 and just, the plumbing goes so deep into all the different systems that it’s, that– but we’re still working on it and we’re going to do it. it’s just it’s taking a little bit longer. jonathan zittrain: so clear history basically means i am as if a newb, i just show mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: even though i’ve been using facebook for a while, it’s as if it knows nothing about me and it starts accreting again. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i’m just trying to think just as a plain old citizen, how would i make an informed judgment about how often to do that or when i should do it? what–? mark zuckerberg: well, hold on. let’s go to that in a second. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: but one thing, just to connect the dots on the last conversation. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. right. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay. right. that’s going to, if we’re going to give controls over data use, we’re going to do that for everyone in the community. so that’s the first thing that i think we need to go do. mark zuckerberg: so that’s, so that’s kind of– this is sort of the how we’re thinking about the projects and this is a really deep and big technical project but we’re committed to doing it because i think it’s that’s what it’s there for. [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: and i guess like an ad block or somebody could then write a little script for your browser that would just clear your history every time you visit or something. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, no, but the plan would also be to offer something that’s an ongoing thing. jonathan zittrain: i see. mark zuckerberg: in your browser, but i think the analogy here is you kind of have, in your browser you have the ability to clear your cookies. and then, like, in some other place you have under your, like, nuclear settings, like, don’t ever accept any cookies in my browser. and it’s like, all right, your browser’s not really going to work that well. jonathan zittrain: yeah. <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but, but you can do that if you want because you should have that control. i think that these are part and parcel, right. it’s i think a lot of people might go and clear their history on a periodic basis because they– or, or actually in the research that we’ve done on this as we’ve been developing it, the real thing that people have told us that they want is similar to cookie management, not necessarily wiping everything, because that ends in inconvenience of getting logged out of a bunch of things, but there are just certain services or apps that you don’t want that data to be connected to your facebook account. so having the ability on an ad hoc basis to go through and say, “hey, stop associating this thing,” is going to end up being a quite important thing that i think we want to try to deliver. so that’s, this is partially as we’re getting into this, it’s a more complex thing but i think it’s very valuable. and i think if any conversation around the– around subscriptions, i think you would want to start with giving people these, make sure that everyone has these kind of controls. so that’s, we’re kind of in the early phases of doing that. the philosophical downstream question of whether you also let people pay to not have ads, i don’t know. there were a bunch of questions around whether that’s actually a good thing, but i personally don’t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads. that all of the research that we have, it’s it may still end up being the right thing to offer that as a choice down the line, but all of the data that i’ve seen suggests that the vast, vast, vast majority of people want a free service and that the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: people like being able to get information from local businesses and things like that too, so. so there’s a lot of good there. jonathan zittrain: yeah. forty years ago it would have been the question of abc versus hbo and the answer turned out to be yes. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so you’re right. and people might have different things. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: there’s a little paradox lingering in there about if something’s so important and vital that we wouldn’t want to deprive anybody of access to it but therefore nobody gets it until we figured out how to remove it for everybody. mark zuckerberg: what we– [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: in other words, if i could buy my way out of ads and data collection it wouldn’t be fair to those who can’t and therefore we all subsist with it until the advances you’re talking about. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i guess what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle. it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong. so that to me is something that in any conversation about whether we’d evolve towards having a subscription service, i think you have to have these controls first and it’s a very deep thing. a technical problem to go do, but we’re– that’s why we’re working through that. jonathan zittrain: yes. so long as the privacy controls that we’re not able to buy our way into aren’t controls that people ought to have. you know, it’s just the kind of underlying question of is the system as it is that we can’t opt out of a fair system. and that’s of course, you know, you have to go into the details to figure out what you mean by it. but let’s in the remaining time we have left mark zuckerberg: how are we doing on time? jonathan zittrain: we’re good. we’re 76 minutes in. mark zuckerberg: all right, into– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’re going to get through maybe half the topics. jonathan zittrain: yeah, yeah, yeah. mark zuckerberg: and i’ll come back and do another one later. jonathan zittrain: i’m going to bring this in for a landing soon. on my agenda left includes such things as taking out of the box the independent review stuff, chat a little bit about that. i’d be curious, and this might be a nice thing, really, as we wrap up, which would be a sense of any vision you have for what would facebook look like in 10 or 15 years and how different would it be than the facebook of 10 years ago is compared to today. so that’s something i’d want to talk about. is there anything big on your list that you want to make sure we talk about? mark zuckerberg: those are good. those are good topics. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> fair enough. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> jonathan zittrain: so all right, the external review board. mark zuckerberg: yeah. so one of the big questions that i have just been thinking about is, you know, we make a lot of decisions around content enforcement and what stays up and what comes down. and having gone through this process over the last few years of working on the systems, one of the themes that i feel really strongly about is that we shouldn’t be making so many of these decisions ourselves. you know, one of the ways that i try to reason about this stuff is take myself out of the position of being ceo of the company, almost like a rawlsian perspective. if i was a different person, what would i want the ceo of the company to be able to do? and i would not want so many decisions about content to be concentrated with any individual. so– jonathan zittrain: it is weird to see big impactful, to use a terrible word, decisions about what a huge swath of humanity does or doesn’t see inevitably handled as, like, a customer service issue. it does feel like a mismatch, which is what i hear you saying. mark zuckerberg: so let’s, yeah, so i actually think the customer service analogy is a really interesting one. right. so when you email amazon, because they don’t, they make a mistake with your package, that’s customer support. right. i mean, they are trying to provide a service and generally, they can invest more in customer support and make people happier. we’re doing something completely different, right. when someone emails us with an issue or flags some content, they’re basically complaining about something that someone else in the community did. so it’s more like it’s almost more like a court system in that sense. doing more of that does not make people happy because in every one of those transactions one person ends up the winner and one is the loser. either you said that that content, that the content was fine, in which case the person complaining is upset, or you the someone’s content down, in which case the person is really upset because you’re now telling them that they don’t have the ability to express something that they feel is a valid thing that they should be able to express. so in some deep sense while some amount of what we do is customer support, people get locked out of their account, et cetera, you know, we now have, like, more than 30,000 people working on content review and safety review, doing the kind of judgments that, you know, it’s basically a lot of the stuff, we have machine learning systems that flag things that could be problematic in addition to people in the community flagging things, but making these assessments of whether the stuff is right or not. so one of the questions that i just think about, it’s like, okay, well, you have many people doing this. regardless of how much training they have, we’re going to make mistakes, right. so you want to start building in principles around, you know, what you would kind of think of as due process, right. so we’re building in an ability to have an appeal, right, which already is quite good in that we are able to overturn a bunch of mistakes that the first line people make in making these assessments. but at some level i think you also want a level of kind of independent appeal, right, where if, okay, let’s say, so the appeals go to maybe a higher level of facebook employee who is a little more trained in the nuances of the policies; but at some point, i think you also need an appeal to an independent groups, which is, like, is this policy fair? was this–? like is this piece of content really getting on the wrong side of the balance of free expression and safety? and i just don’t think at the end of the day that that’s something that you want centralized in a single company. so now the question is how do you design that system and that’s a real question, right, so that we don’t pretend to have the answers on this. what we’re basically working through is we have a draft proposal and we’re working with a lot of experts around the world to run a few pilots in the first half of this year that can hopefully we can codify into something that’s a longer term thing. but i just, i believe that this is just an incredibly important thing. as a person and if i take aside the role that i have as ceo of the company, i do not want the company being able to make all of those final decisions without a check and balance and accountability, so i want to use the position that i’m in to help build that kind of an institution. jonathan zittrain: yes. and when we talk about an appeal, then, it sounds like you could appeal two distinct things. one is this was the rule but it was applied wrong to me. this, in fact, was parody [ph?] so it shouldn’t be seen as near the line. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i want the independent body to look at that. the other would be the rule is wrong. the rule should change because– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and you’re thinking the independent body could weigh in on both of those? mark zuckerberg: yeah. over time, i would like the role of the independent oversight board to be able to expand to do additional things as well. i think the question is it’s hard enough to even set something up that’s going to codify the values that we have around expression and safety on a relatively defined topic. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so i think the question is if you kind of view this as an experiment in institution building where we’re trying to build this thing that is going to have real power tojonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i mean, like, i will not be able to make a decision that overturns what they say. which i think is good. i think also just it raises the stakes. you need to make sure we get this right, so. jonathan zittrain: it’s fascinating. it’s huge. i think the way you’re describing it, i wouldn’t want to understate– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: that this is not a usual way of doing business. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i think it– i think this is– i really care about getting this right. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but i think you want to start with something that’s relatively well-defined and then hopefully expand it to be able to cover more things over time. so in the beginning i think one question that could come up is my understanding, i mean, it’s always dangerous talking about legal precedence when i’m, this might be one of my first times at harvard law school. i did not spend a lot of time here<laughter> mark zuckerberg: when i was an undergrad. but, you know what i mean, the, if the supreme court overturns something, they don’t tell congress what the law should be, they just say there’s an issue here, right. and then basically there’s a process. all right. so if i’m getting that wrong<laughter> mark zuckerberg: all right. i shouldn’t have done that. jonathan zittrain: no, no. that’s quite honest. [ph?] mark zuckerberg: i knew that was dangerous. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: and that that was a mistake. jonathan zittrain: there are people who do agree with you. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. oh, so that’s an open question that that’s how it works. jonathan zittrain: it’s a highly debated question, yes. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: there’s the i’m just the umpire calling balls and strikes and in fact, the first type of question we brought up, which was, “hey, we get this is the standard. does it apply here?” lends itself a little more to, you know, you get three swings and if you miss them all, like, you can’t keep playing. the umpire can usher you away from the home plate. this is, i’m really digging deep into my knowledge now of baseball. there’s another thing about, like,– mark zuckerberg: that’s okay. i’m not the person who’s going to call you out on getting something wrong there. jonathan zittrain: i appreciate that. mark zuckerberg: that’s why i also need to have a librarian next to me at all times. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: very good. i wonder how much librarians tend to know about baseball. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: aww. jonathan zittrain: but we digress. ah, we’re going to get letters, mentions. mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: but whether or not the game is actually any good with a three strikes rule, maybe there should be two or four or whatever, starts to ask of the umpire more than just, you know, your best sense of how that play just went. both may be something. both are surely beyond standard customer service issues, so both could maybe be usefully externalized. what you’d ask the board to do in the category one kind of stuff maybe it’s true that, like, professional umpirage [ph?] could help us and there are people who are jurists who can do that worldwide. for the other, whether it’s the supreme jonathan zittrain: –court, or the so-called common law and state courts where often a state supreme court will be like, “henceforth, 50 feet needs to be the height of a baseball net,” and like, “if you don’t agree, legislature, we’ll hear from you, but until then it’s 50 feet.” they really do kind of get into the weeds. they derive maybe some legitimacy for decisions like that from being close to their communities, and it really regresses them to a question of: is facebook a global community, a community of 2.x billion people worldwide, transcending any national boundaries, and for which i think so far on these issues, it’s meant to be, “the rule is the rule,” it doesn’t really change in terms of service from one place to anotherversus how much do we think of it as somehow localized– whether or not localized through governmentbut where different local communities make their own judgments? mark zuckerberg: that is one of the big questions. i mean, right now we have community standards that are global. we follow local laws, as you say. but i think the idea is– i don’t think we want to end up in a place where we have very different norms in different places, but you want to have some sense of representation and making sure that the body that can deliberate on this has a good diversity of views. so these are a lot of the things that we’re trying to figure out, is like: well, how big is the body? when decisions are made, are they made by the whole body, or do you have panels of people that are smaller sets? if there are panels, how do you make sure that you’re not just getting a random sample that kind of skews in the values perspective towards one thing? so then there a bunch of mechanisms like, okay, maybe one panel that’s randomly constituted decides on whether the board will take up a question or one of the issues, but then a separate random panel of the group actually does the decisions, so that way you eliminate some risk that any given panel is going to be too ideologically skewed. so there’s a bunch of things that i think we need to think through and work through, but the goal on this is to, over time, have it grow into something that can provide greater accountability and oversight to potentially more of the hard questions that we face, but i think it’s so high-stakes that starting with something that’s relatively defined is going to be the right way to go in the beginning. so regardless of the fact that i was unaware of the controversy around the legal point that i made a second ago, i do think in our case it makes sense to start with not having this group say what the policies are going to be, but just have there be– have it be able to say, “hey, we think that you guys are on the wrong side on this, and maybe you should rethink where the policy is because we think you’re on the wrong side.” there’s one other thing that i think is worth calling out, which is in a typical kind of judicial analog, or at least here in the u.s., my understanding, is there’s the kind of appeal route to the independent board considering an issue, but i also think that we want to have an avenue where we as the company can also just raise hard issues that come up to the board without having– which i don’t actually know if there’s any mechanism for that. jonathan zittrain: it’s called an advisory opinion. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: but under u.s. federal law, it’s not allowed because of article iii case or controversy requirement, but state courts do it all the time. you’ll have a federal court sometimes say– because it’s a federal court but it’s deciding something under state law. it’ll be like, “i don’t know, ask florida.” and they’ll be like, “hey florida,” and then florida is just florida. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: sure. so i think that– jonathan zittrain: so you can do an advisory opinion. mark zuckerberg: –that’ll end up being an important part of this too. we’re never going to be able to get out of the business of making frontline judgments. we’ll have the ai systems flag content that they think is against policies or could be, and then we’ll have people– this set of 30 thousand people, which is growing– that is trained to basically understand what the policies are. we have to make the frontline decisions, because a lot of this stuff needs to get handled in a timely way, and a more deliberative process that’s thinking about the fairness and the policies overall should happen over a different timeframe than what is often relevant, which is the enforcement of the initial policy. but i do think overall for a lot of the biggest questions, i just want to build a more independent process. jonathan zittrain: well, as you say, it’s an area with fractal complexity in the best of ways, and it really is terra incognito, and it’d be exciting to see how it might be built out. i imagine there’s a number of law professors around the world, including some who come from civil rather than common law jurisdictions, who are like, “this is how it works over here,” from which you could draw. another lingering question would be– lawyers often have a bad reputation. i have no idea why. but they often are the glue for a system like this so that a judge does not have to be oracular or omniscient. there’s a process where the lawyer for one side does a ton of work and looks at prior decisions of this board and says, “well, this is what would be consistent,” and the other lawyer comes back, and then the judge just gets to decide between the two, rather than having to just know everything. there’s a huge tradeoff here for every appealed content decision, how much do we want to build it into a case, and you need experts to help the parties, versus they each just sort of come before solomon and say, “this kind of happened,” and– or judge judy maybe is a more contemporary reference. mark zuckerberg: somewhere between the two, yeah. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: yeah. so it’s a lot of stuff– and for me, i both find myself– i don’t know if this is the definition of prurient– both excited by it and somewhat terrified by it, but very much saying that it’s better than a status quo, which is where i think you and i are completely agreeing, and maybe a model for other firms out there. so that’s the last question in this area that pops to my mind, which is: what part of what you’re developing at facebook– a lot of which is really resource-intensive– is best thought of as a public good to be shared, including among basically competitors, versus, “that’s part of our comparative advantage and our secret sauce”? if you develop a particularly good algorithm that can really well detect fake news or spammers or bad actors– you’ve got the phds, you’ve got the processors– is that like, “in your face, schmitter [ph?],” or is like, “we should have somebody that– some body– that can help democratize that advance”? and it could be the same to be said for these content decisions. how do you think about that? mark zuckerberg: yeah, so certainly the threat-sharing and security work that you just referenced is a good area where there’s much better collaboration now than there was historically. i think that that’s just because everyone recognizes that it’s such a more important issue. and by the way, there’s much better collaboration with governments now too on this, and not just our own here in the u.s., and law enforcement, but around the world with election commissions and law enforcement, because there’s just a broad awareness that these are issues and that– jonathan zittrain: especially if you have state actors in the mix as the adversary. mark zuckerberg: yes. so that’s certainly an area where there’s much better collaboration now, and that’s good. there’s still issues. for example, if you’re law enforcement or intelligence and you have developed a– “source” is not the right word– but basically if you’ve identified someone as a source of signals that you can watch and learn about, then you may not want to come to us and tell us, “hey, we’ve identified that this state actor is doing this bad thing,” because then the natural thing that we’re going to want to do is make sure that they’re not on our system doing bad things, or that they’re not– either they’re not in the system at all or that we’re interfering with the bad things that they’re trying to do. so there’s some mismatch of incentives, but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, “hey, this is what we’re at.” so i just think having that kind of baseline where you build that up over time is helpful. and i think on security and safety is probably the biggest area of that kind of collaboration now, across all the different types of threats; not just election and democratic process type stuff, but any kind of safety issue. the other area where i tend to think about what we’re doing is– it should be open– is just technical infrastructure overall. i mean, that is probably a less controversial piece, but we open-source a lot of the basic stuff that runs our systems, and i think that that is a– that’s a contribution that i’m quite proud of that we do. we have sort of pioneered this way of thinking about how people connect, and the data model around that is more of a graph, and the idea of graph database and a lot of the infrastructure for being able to efficiently access that kind of content i think is broadly applicable beyond the context of a social network. when i was here as an undergrad, even though i wasn’t here for very long, i studied psychology and computer science, and to me– i mean, my grounding philosophy on this stuff is that basically people should be at the center of more of the technology that we build. i mean, one of the early things that i kind of recognized when i was a student was like– at the time, there were internet sites for finding almost anything you cared about, whether it’s books or music or news or information or businesses– but as people, we think about the world primarily in terms of other people, not in terms of other objects, not cutting things up in terms of content or commerce or politics or different things, but it’s like– the stuff should be organized around the connections that people have, where people are at the centerpiece of that, and one of the missions that i care about is over time just pushing more technology development in the tech industry overall to develop things with that mindset. i think– and this is a little bit of a tangentbut the way that our phones work today, and all computing systems, organized around apps and tasks is fundamentally not how people– how our brains work and how we approach the world. it’s not– so that’s one of the reasons why i’m just very excited longer-term about especially things like augmented reality, because it’ll give us a platform that i think actually is how we think about stuff. we’ll be able to bring the computational objects into the world but fundamentally we’ll be interacting as people around them. the whole thing won’t be organized around an app or a task; it’ll be organized around people, and that i think is a much more natural and human system for how our technology should be organized. so opensourcing all of that infrastructure– to do that, and enabling not just us but other companies to kind of get that mindset into more of their thinking and the technical underpinning of that, is just something that i care really deeply about. jonathan zittrain: well, this is nice, and this is bringing us in for our landing, because we’re talking about 10, 20, 30 years ahead. as a term of art, i understand augmented reality to mean, “i’ve got a visor”version 0.1 was google glass– something where i’m kind of out in the world but i’m literally online at the same time because there’s data coming at me in some– that’s what you’re talking about, correct? mark zuckerberg: yeah, although it really should be glasses like what you have. i think we’ll probablymaybe they’ll have to be a little bigger, but not too much bigger or else it would start to get weird. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: so i don’t think a visor is going to catch. i don’t think anyone is psyched about that feature. jonathan zittrain: and anything involving surgery starts to sound a little bad too. mark zuckerberg: no, no, we’re definitely focused on– <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: –on external things. although– jonathan zittrain: like, “don’t make news, don’t make news, don’t make news.” <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. although we have showed this demo of basically can someone type by thinking, and of course when you’re talking about brain-computer interfaces, there’s two dimensions of that work. there’s the external stuff, and there’s the internal stuff, and invasive, and yes, of course if you’re actually trying to build things that everyone is going to use, you’re going to want to focus on the noninvasive things. jonathan zittrain: yes. can you type by thinking? mark zuckerberg: you can. jonathan zittrain: it’s called a ouija board. no. but you’re subvocalizing enough or there’s enough of a read of– mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. so there’s actually a bunch of the research here– there’s a question of throughput and how quickly can you type and how many bits can you express efficiently, but the basic foundation for the research is someone– a bunch of folks who are doing this research showed a bunch of people images– i think it was animals– so, “here’s an elephant, here’s a giraffe”– while having kind of a net on their head, noninvasive, but shining light and therefore looking at the level of blood activity andjust blood flow and activity in the brain– trained a machine learning basically on what the pattern of that imagery looked like when the person was looking at different animals, then told the person to think about an animal, right? so think about– just pick one of the animals to think about, and can predict what the person was thinking about in broad strokes just based on matching the neural activity. so the question is, so you can use that to type. jonathan zittrain: fifth amendment implications are staggering. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: sorry. mark zuckerberg: well, yes. i mean, presumably this would be something that someone would choose to use a product. i’m not– yeah, yeah. i mean, yes, there’s of course all the other implications, but yeah, i think that this is going to be– that’s going to be an interesting thing down the line. jonathan zittrain: but basically your vision then for a future– mark zuckerberg: i don’t know how we got onto that. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: you can’t blame me. i think you brought this up. mark zuckerberg: i did, but of all the things that– i mean, this is exciting, but we haven’t even covered yet how we should talk about– tech regulation and all this stuff i figured we’d get into. i mean, we’ll be here for like six or seven hours. i don’t know how many days you want to spend here to talking about this, but– jonathan zittrain: “we’re here at the zuckerberg center and hostage crisis.” <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: “the building is surrounded.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. but i think a little bit on future tech and research is interesting too, so. jonathan zittrain: please. mark zuckerberg: yeah, we’re good. jonathan zittrain: oh, we did cover it, is what you’re saying. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: i mean, but going back to your question about what– if this is the last topic– what i’m excited about for the next 10 or 20 years– i do think over the long term, reshaping our computing platforms to be fundamentally more about people and how we process the world is a really fundamental thing. over the nearer term– so call it five years– i think the clear trend is towards more private communication. if you look at all of the different ways that people want to share and communicate across the internet– but we have a good sense of the cross-strength, everything from one-on-one messages to kind of broadcasting publicly– the thing that is growing the fastest is private communication. right? so between whatsapp and messenger, and instagram now, just the number of private messages– it’s about 100 billion a day through those systems alone, growing very quickly, growing much faster than the amount that people want to share or broadcast into a feed-type system. of the type of broadcast content that people are doing, the thing that is growing by far the fastest is stories. right? so ephemeral sharing of, “i’m going to put this out, but i want to have a timeframe after which the data goes away.” so i think that that just gives you a sense of where the hub of social activity is going. it also is how we think about the strategy of the company. i mean, people– when we talk about privacy, i think a lot of the questions are often about privacy policies and legal or policy-type things, and privacy as a thing not to be breached, and making sure that you’re within the balance of what is good. but i actually think that there’s a much more– there’s another element of this that’s really fundamental, which is that people want tools that give them new contexts to communicate, and that’s also fundamentally about giving people power through privacy, not just not violating privacy, right? so not violating privacy is a backstop, but actually– you can kind of think about all the success that facebook has had– this is kind of a counterintuitive thing– has been because we’ve given people new private or semi-private ways to communicate things that they wouldn’t have had before. so thinking about facebook as an innovator in privacy is certainly not the mainstream view, but going back to the very first thing that we did, making it so harvard students could communicate in a way that they had some confidence that their content and information would be shared with only people within that community, there was no way that people had to communicate stuff at that scale, but not have it either be completely public or with just a small set of people before. and people’s desire to be understood and express themselves and be able to communicate with all different kinds of groups is, in the experience that i’ve had, nearly unbounded, and if you can give people new ways to be able to communicate safely and express themselves, then that is something that people just have a deep thirst and desire for. so encryption is really important, because i mean, we take for granted in the u.s. that there’s good rule of law, and that the government isn’t too much in our business, but in a lot of places around the world, especially where whatsapp is the biggest, people can’t take that for granted. so having it so that you really have confidence that you’re sharing something one-on-one and it’s not– and it really is one-on-one, it’s not one-on-one and the government there– actually makes it so people can share things that they wouldn’t be comfortable otherwise doing it. that’s power that you’re giving people through building privacy innovations. stories i just think is another example of this, where there are a lot of things that people don’t want as part of the permanent record but want to express, and it’s not an accident that that is becoming the primary way that people want to share with all of their friends, not putting something in a feed that goes on their permanent record. there will always be a use for that too– people want to have a record and there’s a lot of value that you can build around that– you can have longer-term discussions– it’s harder to do that around stories. there’s different value for these things. but over the next five years, i think we’re going to see all of social networking kind of be reconstituted around this base of private communication, and that’s something that i’m just very excited about. i think that that’s– it’s going to unlock a lot of people’s ability to express themselves and communicate things that they haven’t had the tools to do before, and it’s going to be the foundation for building a lot of really important tools on top of that too. jonathan zittrain: that’s so interesting to me. i would not have predicted that direction for the next five years. i would have figured, “gosh, if you already know with whom you want to speak, there are so many tools to speak with them,” some of which are end-to-end, some of which aren’t, some of which are rollyourown and open-source, and there’s always a way to try to make that easier and better, but that feels a little bit to me like a kind of crowded space, not yet knowing of the innovations that might lie ahead and means of communicating with the people you already know you want to talk to. and for that, as you say, if that’s where it’s at, you’re right that encryption is going to be a big question, and otherwise technical design so that if the law comes knocking on the door, what would the company be in a position to say. this is the apple iphone cupertino– sorry, san bernardino case– and it also calls to mind will there be peer-to-peer implementations of the things you’re thinking about that might not even need the server at all, and it’s basically just an app that people use, and if it’s going to deliver an ad, it can still do that appside, and how much governments will abide it. they have not, for the most part, demanded technology mandates to reshape how the technology works. they’re just saying, “if you’ve got it”– in part you’ve got it because you want to serve ads– “we want it.” but if you don’t even have it, it’s been rare for the governments to say, “well, you’ve got to build your system to do it.” it did happen with the telephone system back in the day. calea, the communications assistance to law enforcement act, did have federal law in the united states saying, “if you’re in the business of building a phone network, at&t, you’ve got to make it so we can plug in as you go digital,” and we haven’t yet seen those mandates in the internet software side so much. so we can see that coming up again. but it’s so funny, because if you’d asked me, i would have figured it’s encountering people you haven’t met before and interacting with them, for which all of the stuff about air traffic control of what goes into your feed and how much your stuff gets shared– all of those issues start to rise to the fore, and it gets me thinking about, “i ought to be able to make a feed recipe that’s my recipe, and fills it according to facebook variables, but i get to say what the variables are.” but i could see that if you’re just thinking about people communicating with the people they already know and like, that is a very different realm. mark zuckerberg: it’s not necessarily– it’s not just the people that you already know. i do think– we’ve really focused on friends and family for the last 10 or 15 years, and i think a big part of what we’re going to focus on now is around building communities in different ways and all the utility that you can build on top of, once you have a network like this in place. so everything from how people can do commerce better to things like dating, which is– a lot of dating happens on our services, but we haven’t built any tools specifically for that. jonathan zittrain: i do remember the facebook joint experiment– “experiment” is such a terrible wordstudy, by which one could predict when two facebook members are going to declare themselves in a relationship, months ahead of the actual declaration. i was thinking some of the ancillary products were in-laws. mark zuckerberg: that was very early. yeah. so you’re right that a lot of this is going to be about utility that you can build on top of it, but a lot of these things are fundamentally private, right? so if you’re thinking about commerce, that people have a higher expectation for privacy, and the question is: is the right context for that going to be around an app like facebook, which is broad, or an app like instagram? i think part of it is– the discovery part of it, i think we’ll be very well served there– but then we’ll also transition to something that people want to be more private and secure. anyhow, we could probably go on for many hours on this, but maybe we should save this for the round 2 of this that we’ll do in the future. jonathan zittrain: indeed. so thanks so much for coming out, for talking at such length, for covering such a kaleidoscopic range of topics, and we look forward to the next time we see you. mark zuckerberg: yeah. thanks. jonathan zittrain: thanks. <audience applause>"

"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here. 1. pinterest files confidentially to go public the business has confidentially submitted paperwork to the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering slated for later this year, according to a report from the wall street journal. earlier reports indicated the company was planning to debut on the stock market in april. in late january, pinterest took its first official step toward a 2019 ipo, hiring goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase as lead underwriters for its offering. 2. google ends forced arbitration for employees this is a direct response to a group of outspoken google employees protesting the company’s arbitration practices. forced arbitration ensures that workplace disputes are settled behind closed doors and without any right to an appeal, effectively preventing employees from suing companies. 3. facebook will shut down its spyware vpn app onavo facebook will end its unpaid market research programs and proactively take its onavo vpn app off the google play store in the wake of backlash following techcrunch’s investigation about onavo code being used in a facebook research app that sucked up data about teens. in this photo taken on february 6, 2019, indian delivery men working with the food delivery apps uber eats and swiggy wait to pick up an order outside a restaurant in mumbai. 4. uber is reportedly close to making a tactical exit from india’s food delivery industry india’s economic times is reporting that uber is in the final stages of a deal that would see swiggy eat up uber eats in india in exchange for giving the u.s. ride-hailing firm a 10 percent share of its business. 5. google’s ‘digital wellbeing’ features hit more devices, including samsung galaxy s10 initially available exclusively to pixel and android one device owners, digital wellbeing’s feature set is now rolling out to nokia 6 and nokia 8 devices with android pie, as well as on the new samsung galaxy s10. 6. doordash raises $400m round, now valued at $7.1b recent data from second measure shows that doordash has overtaken uber eats in u.s. market share — for online food delivery, it now comes in second to grubhub. 7. venmo launches a ‘limited edition’ rainbow debit card for its payment app users the new rainbow card will be offered until supplies last, venmo says. and existing card holders can request this card as a replacement for their current card, if they choose."
"welcome back to transportation weekly; i’m your host kirsten korosec, senior transportation reporter at techcrunch . this is the fifth edition of our newsletter and we love the reader feedback. keep it coming. never heard of techcrunch’s transportation weekly? catch up here, here and here. as i’ve written before, consider this a soft launch. follow me on twitter @kirstenkorosec to ensure you see it each week. (an email subscription is coming.)  this week, we explore the world of light detection and ranging sensors known as lidar, young drivers, trouble in barcelona, autonomous trucks in california, and china among other things. onm … there are oems in the automotive world. and here, (wait for it) there are onms — original news manufacturers. (cymbal clash!) this is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation lives. this week, we’re going to put on our analysis hats as we explore the world of lidar, a sensor that measures distance using laser light to generate highly accurate 3d maps of the world around the car. lidar is considered by most in the self-driving car industry (tesla ceo elon musk being one exception) a key piece of technology required to safely deploy robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. there are a lot of companies working on lidar. some counts track upwards of 70. for years now, velodyne has been the primary supplier of lidar sensors to companies developing autonomous vehicles. waymo, back when it was just the google self-driving project, even used velodyne lidar sensors until 2012. dozens of startups have sprung up with velodyne in its sights. but now waymo has changed the storyline. to catch you up: waymo announced this week that it will start selling its custom lidar sensors — the technology that was at the heart of a trade secrets lawsuit last year against uber. waymo’s entry into the market doesn’t necessarily upend other companies’ plans. waymo is going to sell its short-range lidar, called laser bear honeycomb, to companies outside of self-driving cars. it will initially target robotics, security and agricultural technology. it does put pressure on startups, particularly those with less capital or those targeting the same customer base. pitchbook ran the numbers for us to determine where the lidar industry sits at the moment. there are two stories here: there are a handful of well-capitalized startups, and we may have reached “peak” lidar. last year, there were 28 vc deals in lidar technology valued at $650 million. the number of deals was slightly lower than in 2017, but the values jumped by nearly 34 percent. the top global vc-backed lidar technology companies (by post valuation) are quanergy, velodyne (although mostly corporate backed), aurora (not self-driving company aurora innovation), ouster, and dronedeploy. the graphic below, also courtesy of pitchbook, shows the latest figures as of january 31, 2019. dig in researchers discovered that two popular car alarm systems were vulnerable to a manipulated server-side api that could be abused to take control of an alarm system’s user account and their vehicle. the companies — russian alarm maker pandora and california-based viper (or clifford in the u.k.) — have fixed the  security vulnerabilities that allowed researchers to remotely track, hijack and take control of vehicles with the alarms installed. what does this all mean? our in-house security expert and reporter zack whittaker digs in and gives us a reality check. follow him @zackwhittaker. since the first widely publicized car hack in 2015 proved hijacking and controlling a car was possible, it’s opened the door to understanding the wider threat to modern vehicles. most modern cars have internet connectivity, making their baseline surface area of attack far greater than a car that doesn’t. but the effort that goes into remotely controlling a vehicle is difficult and convoluted, and the attack — often done by chaining together a set of different vulnerabilities — can take weeks or even longer to develop. key fob or replay attacks are far more likely than, say, remote attacks over the internet or cell network. a key fob sends an “unlock” signal, a device captures that signal and replays it. by replaying it you can unlock the car. this latest car hack, featuring flawed third-party car alarms, was far easier to exploit, because the alarm systems added a weakness to the vehicles that weren’t there to begin with. carmakers, with vast financial and research resources, do a far greater job at securing their vehicles than the small companies that focus on functionality over security. for now, the bigger risk comes from third parties in the automobile space, but the carmakers can’t afford to drop their game, either. a little bird … we hear a lot. but we’re not selfish. let’s share. the california department motor vehicles is the government body that regulates autonomous vehicle testing on public roads. the job of enforcement falls to the california highway patrol. in an effort to gauge the need for more robust testing guidelines, the california highway patrol decided to hold an event at its headquarters in sacramento. eight companies working on autonomous trucking technology were invited. it was supposed to be a large event with local and state politicians in attendance. and it was supposed to validate autonomous trucking as an emerging industry. there’s just one problem: only one av trucking company is willing and able to complete this course. we hear that this av startup actually already went ahead and completed the test course. the california highway patrol has postponed event, for now, presumably until more companies can join. got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation? email me or send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec. deal of the week instead of highlighting one giant deal, let’s step back and take a broader view of mobility this week. the upshot: 2018 saw a decline in total investments in the sector and money moved away from ride-hailing and toward two-wheeled transportation. according to new research from ey, mobility investments in 2018 reached $39.1 billion, down from $55.2 billion in the previous year. (the figures ey provided was through november 2018.) ride-hailing companies raised $7.1 billion in 2018, a 73 percent decline from the previous year when $26.7 billion poured into this sector. investors, it seems, are shifting their focus to other business models, notably first- and last-mile connectivity. ey estimates $7 billion was invested in two-wheeler mobility companies such as bike-sharing and electric scooters in 2018. the u.s. and china together have contributed to more than 80 percent of overall two-wheeler mobility investments this year alone, according to ey research shared with techcrunch. other deals: flixbus, the german uber-like bus service, is buying rival eurolines from transdev. vayavision, an autonomous vehicle technology startup that developed perception software received a 2.45 million euro grant ($2.75 million) from the european commission’s european innovation council. the company is backed by backed by lg corp and mitsubishi ufj capital. remix picks up $15 million to help cities make better decisions around transit. hammerhead raises $4.2 million to build a better operating system for bikes. brodmann17 — named after the primary visual cortex in the human brain — raised $11 million in a series a round of funding led by ourcrowd, with participation also from maniv mobility, ai alliance, ul ventures, samsung next, and the sony innovation fund. snapshot let’s talk about generation z, that group of young people born 1996 to the present, and one startup that is focused on turning that demographic into car owners. there’s lots of talk and hand-wringing about young people choosing not to get a driver’s license, or not buying a vehicle. in the uk, for instance, about 42 percent of young drivers aged 17 to 24 hold a driver’s license. that’s about 2.7 million people, according to the national travel survey 2018 (nts) of the uk government’s department of transport. an additional 2.2 million have a provisional or learner license. combined, that amounts to about 13 percent of the car driving population of the uk. in the uk, evidence suggests that a rise in motoring costs have discouraged young people from learning. and therein lies one opportunity that a new startup called driver1 is targeting. driver 1 is a car subscription service designed exclusively for first car drivers aged 17 to 24. the company has been in stealth mode for about a year and is just now launching. “the young driver market is being underserved by the car industry,” driver1 founder tim hammond told techcrunch. “and primarily it’s the financing that’s not available for that age group. it’s also something that’s not really affordable for any of the car subscription models like fair.com, and it’s not suitable for the oem subscription services, either financially or from an age perspective for young drivers.” the company’s own research has found this group wants a newer car for 12 to 15 months. “the car is the extension of their device,” hammond said, noting these drivers don’t want the old junkers. “they want their iphones and they want the car that goes with it.” the company is working directly with leasing companies — not dealerships — to provide young drivers with 3- to 5-year-old cars that have lost 60 percent or so of their value. driver1 is targeting under $120 a month for the customer and has a partnership with remarketing company manheim, which is owned by cox automotive. the startup is focused on the uk for now and has about 600 members who have reserved their cars for purchase. driver1 is aiming to capture about 10 percent of the 1 million or so young people in the uk who pass their learners permit each year. the company plans to expand to france and other european countries in the fall. tiny but mighty micromobility ca-caw, ca-caw! that’s the sound of bird gearing up to launch bird platform in new zealand, canada and latin america in the coming weeks. the platform is part of bird’s mission to bring its scooters across the world “and empower local entrepreneurs in regions where we weren’t planning to launch to run their own electric-scooter sharing program with bird’s tech and vehicles,” bird ceo travis vanderzanden told techcrunch. mrd’s two cents: bird platform seems like a way for bird to make extra cash without having to do any of the work i.e. charging the vehicles, maintaining them and working with city officials to get permits. smart! meanwhile, the dolla dolla bills keep pouring into micromobility. european electric scooter startup voi technology raised an additional $30 million in capital. that was on top of a $50 million series a round just three months ago. oh, and because micromobility isn’t just for startups, volkswagen decided to launch a kind of weird-looking electric scooter in geneva. because, why not? — megan rose dickey one more thing … lyft is trimming staff to prepare for its ipo. techcrunch’s ingrid lunden learned that the company has laid off about 50 staff in its bike and scooter division. it appears most of these folks are people who joined the lyft through its acquisition of  electric bike sharing startup motivate, a deal that closed about three months ago. notable reads it’s probably not smart to suggest another newsletter, but if you haven’t checked out michael dunne’s  the chinese are coming newsletter, you should. dunne has a unique perspective on what’s happening in china, particularly as it relates to automotive and newer forms of mobility, such as ride-hailing. one interesting nugget from his latest edition: there are more than 20 other new electric vehicle makers in china. “most will fall away within the next 3 to 4 years as cash runs out,” dunne predicts. other quotable notables: here’s a fun read for the week. techcrunch’s lucas matney wrote about a yc combinator startup jetpack aviation.the startup has launched pre-orders this week for the moonshot of moonshots, the speeder, a personal vertical take-off and landing vehicle with a svelte concept design that looks straight out of star wars or halo. testing and deployments spanish ride-hailing firm cabify is back operating in barcelona, spain despite issuing dire warnings that new regulations issued by local government would crush its business and force it to fire thousands of drivers and leave forever. turns out forever is one month. the catalan generalitat issued a decree last month imposing a wait time of at least 15 minutes between a booking being made and a passenger being picked up. the policy was made to ensure taxis and ride-hailing firms are not competing for the same passengers, following a series of taxi strikes, which included scenes of violence. our boots on the ground reporter natasha lomas has the whole story. sure, barcelona is just one city. but what happened in barcelona isn’t an isolated incident. the early struggles between conventional taxis and ride-hailing operations might be over, but that doesn’t mean the matter has been settled altogether. and it’s not likely to go away. once robotaxis actually hit the road en masse — and yes, that’ll be awhile — these same struggles will pop up again. other deployments, or, er, retreats …. bike share pioneer mobike retreats to china on the autonomous vehicle front: china post, the official postal service of china, and delivery and logistics companies deppon express, will begin autonomous package delivery services in april. the delivery trucks will operate on autonomous driving technologies developed by fabu technology, an ai company focused on intelligent driving systems. on our radar there is a lot of transportation-related activity this month. come find me. sxsw in austin: techcrunch will be at sxsw. and there is a lot of mobility action here. aurora ceo and co-founder chris urmson was on stage saturday morning with malcolm gladwell. mayors from a number of u.s. cities as well as companies like ford and mercedes are on the scene. here’s where i’ll be.  2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. (local time) march 9 at the empire garage for the smart mobility summit, an annual event put on by wards intelligence and c3 group. the autonocast, the podcast i co-host with alex roy and ed niedermeyer, will also be on hand. 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. (local time) march 12 at the jw marriott. the autonocast and founding general partner of trucks vc, reilly brennan, will hold a sxsw podcast panel on automated vehicle terminology and other stuff. 3:30 p.m (local time) over at the hilton austin downtown, i’ll be moderating a panel re-inventing the wheel: own, rent, share, subscribe. sherrill kaplan with zipcar, amber quist, with silvercar and russell lemmer with dealerware will join me on stage. techcrunch is also hosting a sxsw party from 1 pm to 4 pm sunday, march 10, 615 red river st., that will feature musical guest elderbrook. rsvp here.  nvidia gtc techcrunch (including yours truly) will also be at nvidia’s annual gpu technology conference from march 18 to 21 in san jose. self racing cars the annual self racing car event will be held march 23 and march 24 at thunderhill raceway near willows, california. there is still room for participants to test or demo their autonomous vehicles, drive train innovation, simulation, software, teleoperation, and sensors. hobbyists are welcome. sign up to participate or drop them a line at contact@selfracingcars.com. thanks for reading. there might be content you like or something you hate. feel free to reach out to me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share those thoughts, opinions or tips.  nos vemos la próxima vez."
"the “restaurant of the future” may elicit thoughts of a chrome diner with robot servers and an otherwise hefty amount of tokyo futurist kitsch, but the fact is that the forthcoming sit-down dining experience may just end up looking a lot like ordering from a takeout app. presto is working with restaurants to update the 21st century dine-in experience, letting customers order and pay from their table with a tablet device while also providing hardware like wearables for servers so they can be alerted when they are needed by customers. the company announced today that they’ve raised $30 million in growth funding from recruit holdings and romulus capital. i2bf global ventures, eg capital and brainchild holdings also participated in the raise.  considering how much online shopping has shaped commerce and apps like instacart and uber eats are changing how we get food delivered to our houses, it’s a bit peculiar that physical restaurants with hundreds of locations have been so slow to shift the customer experience toward a greater reliance on tech. presto has launched partnerships with a number of restaurant chains like applebee’s, red lobster, denny’s and outback steakhouse. these aren’t exactly mom-and pop locations, but presto ceo raj suri says these large restaurant groups are always looking to shift their weight to improve efficiencies across the board with new tech in a way that most small businesses just aren’t. “i would say most restaurant groups are looking at how they can become more of a tech company… and adopt technology that could help them become more efficient,” suri tells techcrunch. “the industry is moving in this direction in a pretty significant way and it won’t be long before you see our technology in every restaurant.” beyond the ordering hardware, presto’s new ai platform is aiming to give restaurants a more robust look at the state of each individual business and insights that help managers make decisions about staffing or deciding which food items to stock. the platform leverages a variety of data inputs so that things like nearby sporting events or weather patterns can be integrated into suggestions about how many servers should be staffed on a given tuesday. presto is looking to supercharge their platform with the funding and rapidly expand their footprint. the 11-year-old company is now supporting 5,000 restaurant locations, but suri says that presto will double that number in 2019."
"the wall street journal published a thought-provoking story this week, highlighting limited partners’ concerns with the softbank vision fund’s investment strategy. the fund’s “decision-making process is chaotic,” it’s over-paying for equity in top tech startups and it’s encouraging inflated valuations, sources told the wsj. the report emerged during a particularly busy time for the vision fund, which this week led two notable vc deals in clutter and flexport, as well as participated in doordash’s $400 million round; more on all those below. so given all this softbank news, let us remind you that given its $45 billion commitment, saudi arabia’s public investment fund (pif) is the vision fund’s largest investor. saudi arabia is responsible for the planned killing of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi. here’s what i’m wondering this week: do ceos of companies like flexport and clutter have a responsibility to address the source of their capital? should they be more transparent to their customers about whose money they are spending to achieve rapid scale? send me your thoughts. and thanks to those who wrote me last week re: at what point is a y combinator cohort too big? the general consensus was this: the size of the cohort is irrelevant, all that matters is the quality. we’ll have more to say on quality soon enough, as yc demo days begin on march 18. anyways… pinterest is going public! surprise! sort of. not really. pinterest has joined a growing list of tech unicorns planning to go public in 2019. the visual search engine filed confidentially to go public on thursday. reports indicate the business will float at a $12 billion valuation by june. pinterest’s key backers — which will make lots of money when it goes public — include bessemer venture partners, andreessen horowitz, firstmark capital, fidelity and sv angel. lyft’s ipo is imminent  ride-hailing company lyft plans to go public on the nasdaq in march, likely beating rival uber to the milestone. lyft’s s-1 will be made public as soon as next week; its roadshow will begin the week of march 18. the nuts and bolts: jpmorgan chase has been hired to lead the offering; lyft was last valued at more than $15 billion, while competitor uber is valued north of $100 billion. deal of the week: doordash despite scrutiny for subsidizing its drivers’ wages with customer tips, venture capitalists plowed another $400 million into food delivery platform doordash at a whopping $7.1 billion valuation, up considerably from a previous valuation of $3.75 billion. the round, led by temasek and dragoneer investment group, with participation from previous investors softbank vision fund, dst global, coatue management, gic, sequoia capital and y combinator, will help doordash compete with uber eats. the company is currently seeing 325 percent growth, year-over-year. clutter & flexport here are some more details on those big vision fund deals: clutter, an la-based on-demand storage startup, closed a $200 million softbank-led round this week at a valuation between $400 million and $500 million, according to techcrunch’s ingrid lunden’s reporting. meanwhile, flexport, a five-year-old, san francisco-based full-service air and ocean freight forwarder, raised $1 billion in fresh funding led by the softbank vision fund at a $3.2 billion valuation. earlier backers of the company, including founders fund, dst global, cherubic ventures, susa ventures and sf express all participated in the round. here’s your weekly reminder to send me tips, suggestions and more to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or @kateclarktweets.  fresh funds menlo ventures has a new $500 million late-stage fund. dubbed its “inflection” fund, it will be investing between $20 million and $40 million in companies that are seeing at least $5 million in annual recurring revenue, growth of 100 percent year-over-year, early signs of retention and are operating in areas like cloud infrastructure, fintech, marketplaces, mobility and saas. plus, allianz x, the venture capital arm attached to german insurance giant allianz, has increased the size of its fund to $1.1 billion and london’s entrepreneur first brought in $115 million for what is one of the largest “pre-seed” funds ever raised. startup cash flipkart co-founder invests $92m in ola redis labs raises a $60m series e round chinese startup panda selected nabs $50m from tiger global image recognition startup visenze raises $20m series c circle raises $20m series b to help even more parents limit screen time showfields announces $9m seed funding for a flexible approach to brick-and-mortar retail podcasting startup waitwhat raises $4.3m zoba raises $3m to help mobility companies predict demand indian delivery men working with the food delivery apps uber eats and swiggy wait to pick up an order outside a restaurant in mumbai. ( indranil mukherjee/afp/getty images) uber eats india may sell to swiggy according to indian media reports, uber is in the final stages of selling its indian food delivery business to local player swiggy, a food delivery service that recently raised $1 billion in venture capital funding. uber eats plans to sell its indian food delivery unit in exchange for a 10 percent share of swiggy’s business. swiggy was most recently said to be valued at $3.3 billion following that billion-dollar round, which was led by naspers and included new backers tencent and uber investor coatue. new unicorn lalamove, a hong kong-based on-demand logistics startup, is the latest venture-backed business to enter the unicorn club with the close of a $300 million series d round this week. the latest round is split into two, with hillhouse capital leading the “d1” tranche and sequoia china heading up the “d2” portion. new backers eastern bell venture capital and pv capital and returning investors shunwei capital, xiang he capital and mindworks ventures also participated. founders fund gets keith rabois longtime investor keith rabois is joining founders fund as a general partner. here’s more from techcrunch’s connie loizos: “the move is wholly unsurprising in ways, though the timing seems to suggest that another big fund from founders fund is around the corner, as the firm is also bringing aboard a new principal at the same time — delian asparouhov — and firms tend to bulk up as they’re meeting with investors. it’s also kind of time, as these things go. founders fund closed its last flagship fund with $1.3 billion in 2016.” listen to me talk if you enjoy this newsletter, be sure to check out techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, equity. in this week’s episode, available here, crunchbase news editor-in-chief alex wilhelm and i discuss pinterest’s ipo, doordash’s big round and softbank’s upset lps. want more techcrunch newsletters? sign up here."
"grab has become the newest addition to the softbank vision fund after it announced today that it has pulled in a $1.46 billion investment from the super fund. the southeast asian ridesharing company said the new money will be used to further its super app strategy, which is aimed at making its service a daily app for consumers, but it is also likely to be used to battle rival go-jek. the deal — which was first reported by techcrunch in december — takes grab’s ongoing series h round to $4.5 billion. other investors in that round include toyota, booking holdings, microsoft and hyundai. the new deal means grab has now raised more than $7.5 billion to date. grab, which bought out uber’s local business last year, was last valued at $11 billion when it secured a $1 billion investment from toyota to kick off this series h in june. a source told techcrunch that the new round values the company at $14 billion. despite this huge injection, grab confirmed that the round — a record for a southeast asian startup — is not closed yet. techcrunch reported in december that the series h funding goal, which was originally $2 billion, had been raised to $5 billion. the vision fund deal has been months in the making. softbank is an existing investor in grab and, as had already happened with coupang and tokopedia, is transitioning its stake into the vision fund. that hasn’t happened yet, techcrunch understands, but this capital investment hints that it will be completed soon. “we have been working alongside grab for a number of years and are privileged to support the evolution of its user-driven technologies. this investment will help the company explore exciting new opportunities across on-demand mobility, delivery and financial services as it continues to grow its offline-to-online platform across southeast asia,” said softbank’s david thevenon in a statement. beyond ride-hailing, grab also operates payments and food delivery businesses. last year, it began working with third-party partners to bring additional services into the grab family; some of those partners include streaming service hooq, ping an good doctor and grocery delivery company happyfresh. grab’s news today comes just a day after go-jek announced a $100 million injection into its ongoing series h fund, which sources have told techcrunch is aimed at raising $2 billion. the company, which is expanding in southeast asia, said it closed $1 billion from existing investors in january. go-jek originated in indonesia but, over the past six months, it has expanded into vietnam, thailand and singapore, with the philippines also in its plans."
"google today announced that you can now register .dev domain names. google acquired the .dev top-level domain when icann opened up the web to new generic top-level domains (gtld) a few years ago. at the time, google acquired gtld’s like .app, .page and .dev (for some reason, google also owns .soy). right now, the .dev domains are still in an early access program, though. that means you’ll have to pay an additional fee that decreases every day until february 28 — and that early access fee is pretty steep. registering a new domain on godaddy, which is one of the many resellers that offer the new domain names, will set you back over $12,500 in extra fees today. tomorrow, that price drops to just over $3,100. come february 28, you can register any available domain and it’ll just cost you about $20 per year. the idea here, of course, is to manage demand (and to extract a few extra dollars from the companies that really need to have a given domain name). some of the companies and organizations that are already using the new gtld are google itself, as well as the likes of github. women who code, jetbrains, codecademy and salesforce. and because this is 2019, there’s also kubernetes.dev. like its .app domains, .dev domains will require https connections to protect users from ad malware, tracking injections and wi-fi snooping. “we hope .dev will be a new home for you to build your communities, learn the latest tech and showcase your projects—all with a perfect domain name,” google explains in today’s announcement. i never got the sense that there was all that much demand for non-.com or country-level domain names (does the world really need .ninja domains?), but if you always wanted a .dev domain, now would be a good time to get out your credit card. google is launching .app domains, the first tlds secured with built-in https"
"lime is hiring ted tobiason, former managing director in tech equity capital markets at morgan stanley, to serve as its chief financial officer. this comes following lime’s behemoth $310 million series d round earlier this month. led by bain capital ventures, andreessen horowitz, fidelity ventures, gv and ivp, the round values lime at $2.4 billion. lime, which got its beginnings as a bike-share company, has deployed its scooters and bikes in more than 100 cities in the u.s. and 27 international cities. since june, lime has more than doubled the number of cities where it operates in the u.s. lime has also partnered with uber to offer lime scooters within the uber app. additionally, lime recently brought on nancy lee, formerly of google, to lead its human resources efforts as chief human resources officer. lee formerly worked at google as its head of diversity. she retired from the company in december 2016, but has since found a new home with lime. “during her tenure at google, nancy played a key role in encouraging google to disclose its diversity demographic data publicly,” lime wrote in a blog post. “her commitment to inclusion and transparency will be instrumental in leading lime’s cross-cultural team throughout 2019 and beyond.” lime has been on a hiring spree as of late, filling out the ranks in its executive team. earlier this month, lime appointed its head of engineering, li fan, to cto and hired duke stump, formerly of lululemon, to serve as its cmo. “both ted and nancy have outstanding experience at companies that have scaled from small to large,” lime ceo toby sun said in a statement. “with their leadership, we’re excited to take lime to the next level in building a world-class business and people-first company.”"
"go-jek is extending its reach in southeast asia after its thailand-based unit made its official launch, which included the addition of a new food delivery service. get, which is the name for go-jek business in thailand, started out last year offering motorbike taxi on-demand services to a limited part of thai capital city bangkok, now the company said it has expanded the bikes across the city and added food and delivery options. get’s management team is composed of former uber staffers while ceo pinya nittayakasetwat was recruited from chat app line’s food delivery business. over the last two months, get claims to have completed two million trips in the past two months. there’s no word on when get will add four-wheeled transport options, however. on the food side, get is claiming to have 20,000 merchants on its platform but there are some issues. rumming through the app, i found a number of listed restaurants that didn’t include menus. in those instances, customers have to input their dish and price which makes it pretty hard to use. go-jek’s get app in thailand doesn’t include menus for a number of restaurants, making it nearly impossible to order grab is the dominant player in thailand, where it offers taxis, private cars, motorbikes, delivery and food across eight markets in southeast asia. go-jek rose to success in its native indonesia, where it began offering motorbikes on demand but has expanded to cover taxi, cars, food, general services on-demand and fintech. its investors include google, tencent, meituan and sequoia india. that’s the same playbook grab is using, but go-jek is taking its time with its market expansions. thailand represents its third new market beyond indonesia, following launches in vietnam and singapore. the philippines is another market where go-jek has voiced a desire to be present — it has even made an acquisition there — but regulatory issues are holding up a launch. regional expansion doesn’t come cheap and go-jek is in the midst of raising $2 billion to finance these moves. it recently closed $1 billion from existing investors, and deal street asia reports that it could raise as much as $3 billion for the entire series f round. that’s likely in response to grab’s own fundraising plans. the singapore-based company closed $2 billion last year, but it is looking to increase that total to $5 billion with a major injection from softbank’s vision fund a key piece of that puzzle."
"postmates, one of the earlier entrants to the billion-dollar food delivery wars, has raised an additional $100 million in equity funding at a $1.85 billion valuation, as first reported by recode and confirmed to techcrunch by postmates. the round comes four months after the eight-year-old startup drove home a $300 million investment that finally knocked it into “unicorn” territory. new investor blackrock has joined the funding round alongside tiger global, which served as the lead investor of postmates’ september financing. led by co-founder and chief executive officer bastian lehmann, the company has garnered a total of $681 million in venture capital funding from investors, including spark capital, founders fund, uncork capital and slow ventures. in line with several other tech unicorns, postmates has begun prep for an initial public offering that could come this year, including tapping jpmorgan to advise the float. as recode pointed out, the $100 million capital infusion was probably less of a necessary funding event but rather an opportunity for existing investors to liquidate stock ahead of an exit. postmates, which completes 5 million deliveries per month, reportedly expected to record $400 million in revenue in 2018 on food sales of $1.2 billion. the company has not confirmed that figure nor disclosed any other 2018 revenue numbers. the company currently operates in more than 550 cities, recently tacking on another 100 markets to reach an additional 50 million customers. it will be interesting to see how wall street responds to a postmates public listing. though it was an early player in what has become an extremely crowded market, postmates never emerged as the leader in food delivery. now, with supergiants like uber dominating via uber eats and softbank funneling loads of capital into postmates competitor doordash, it shouldn’t count on an oversubscribed ipo. doordash raises another $250m, nearly triples valuation to $4b"
"escalating trade frictions between the u.s. and china have a range of businesses and investors in both countries sweating, but some believe there remains a bright spot where the antagonists can find common ground — fighting environmental issues. one of them is the u.s.-china green fund, which does exactly as the name suggests — financing projects in the u.s. (and the west in general) and china that yield both financial and environmental returns. the fund recently closed its maiden fund of 3.7 billion yuan ($550 million) and has already started to raise a second and larger yuan fund, it told techcrunch. “the u.s.-china green fund believes that cleantech and environmental products are a positive, apolitical sector of focus for u.s.-china cooperation,” said annie zhou, the fund’s director of u.s. external affairs. “currently, trade tensions have elevated some concerns from companies in both countries but have not affected our investments.” with the fresh capital, the firm will continue to back companies that could address china’s environmental challenges, areas that it believes are far and remote from the kind of cybersecurity concerns that underpin the current wave of bilateral tensions. “we are looking for win-win opportunities — improving the environment in china, which will benefit the rest of the world and also help western companies tap into large markets in china,” added zhou. in china alone, the fund has poured 2.8 billion yuan ($420 million) into a portfolio of 13 companies with the likes of a marketplace for green home appliances serving more than 300,000 households and an energy performance service provider that’s completed 100-plus projects at public facilities like hospitals, hotels and supermarkets. aipark draws data from video cameras installed on the streets to mitigate traffic congestion. photo: aipark aside from the more conventional categories of energy efficiency and pollution prevention, the fund also eyes technology companies that could benefit the environment in less obvious ways. one example has been aipark, a startup offering real-time parking maps that can eventually mitigate congestion and thus co2 emissions. a us-china effort the cross-border investor is one-of-a-kind. it was borne out of a landmark joint effort by business leaders and diplomats from china and the u.s. — the world’s no.1 and no.2 carbon emitters — to build a climate-resilient future following chinese president xi jinping’s 2015 meeting with former u.s. president obama. some of the fund’s notable founders include henry paulson, former u.s. secretary of the treasury and founder of the paulson institute, a think tank dedicated to u.s.-china relations. the other crucial founding member is china’s office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, which is headed by vice premier liu he and plays a key role in china’s economic policymaking. trade tensions aside, another potential roadblock exists stateside for the fund: president donald trump’s withdrawal from the paris agreement and his denial of climate change’s devastating effects on the earth. but the green fund is hopeful that the president’s stance is no object, for its focus goes well beyond merely capturing carbon emissions. “there is still a large number of companies in the u.s. working on technologies focused on improving the environment,” says douglas cameron, the fund’s senior managing director. “clearly, climate change is a critical factor in our investment decisions, but a lot of the technologies that we focus on are important independent of one’s position on that topic. clean air, water, and safer agriculture are all within our investment universe, and we believe that supporting companies and technologies that address these environmental challenges are key to sustainable development in china.” investment partners at u.s.-china green fund. photo: u.s.-china green fund the fund’s immunity from the trade war gets one wondering whether it could be a channel to exploit loopholes and fund companies in more politically charged sectors. the firm ruled out the possibility. “that was never part of our consideration,” said zhou, who stressed that the firm’s dual mission is to “improve the bilateral relationship” on top of “addressing environmental pollution through market-oriented means and generating sustainable returns.” investment philosophies the cross-border fund takes a two-pronged approach. the route in the west is straightforward: identify sustainable technologies that can benefit china and invest as a late-stage venture capital because whatever solution it’s bringing into china should probably be proven. in return, these companies can tap the fund’s deep china know-how and expansive local connections, giving them access to a market where the likes of uber and google have struggled and remaining global players — microsoft’s bing and linkedin, just to name two — must constantly parse beijing’s changing and obscure rules. to ramp up its deal-sourcing capabilities in the u.s., the china-based investment firm plans to open an office in chicago by may, where it will provide strategic and financial advisory for companies to enter the china market. on the china side, the fund invests as a private equity firm in companies that may not seem environmental but “have strong channels to environmental markets and the ability to influence the environment.” the idea is that by backing well-oiled companies close to the source of pollution, the fund could influence their decisions on, say, the level of energy efficiency in apartment buildings and the kind of vehicles logistics companies dispatch. some identifiable targets are companies like alibaba, which processes tens of millions of delivery orders every day. but the fund admits even an organization with the level of business and government ties like itself may have a hard time shaking up the giant’s practice. huitongda helps rural farmers sell their farm produce online. photo: huitongda instead, the sort of investment it favors is “getting in early before the company is quite as well-known, and then the alibaba and others can perhaps come in afterwards,” said cameron. to that end, the fund always tries to take a board seat in its chinese companies. one case in point is huitongda, a startup that provides rural retailers with merchandising and marketing tools, generating 35 billion yuan ($5.24 billion) in revenues last year. alibaba chimed in with $717 million right after the u.s.-china green fund made its offer. when it comes to picking co-investors, the fund has been pally with financial institutions like banks and insurance companies as well as limited partners, many of whom are also its strategic partners. another way to collaborate is through special purpose funds. for instance, four rivers was recently set up to restructure and upgrade the chinese steel industry after it raised roughly 5 billion yuan ($750 million) from the u.s.-china green fund, chinese steel group bao wu steel, china’s state-owned china merchants group, and wl ross & co, a private equity firm run by the u.s. secretary of commerce wilbur ross. venture capitalists are on its list, too, as the green fund is willing to bet on early-stage, sustainability-focused startups with market potential in china, such as huitongda. working with officials despite its varied links to the government, the fund insists to make decisions based on market forces. unlike many other investors who are keen to reap policy rewards from areas like electric vehicles, the firm avoids businesses reliant on heavy subsidies. so if a company wants the fund’s money, it not only needs to be green but also profitable. bai bo, ceo of u.s.-china green fund / photo: u.s.-china green fund “once we are in, we will then start urging [the companies] to think in a more sustainable way, but we think they can do that in a way that’s also economically profitable,” said cameron. where the government does come into play is their policy influence on industries pertaining to the environment. that urges the fund to closely study the whims of beijing. “the government in china plays a large role in determining the success or failure of certain industries and even companies. therefore, it is important to develop a good relationship and trust with the government and make sure they understand that you are helping to accomplish their goal,” suggested zhou. the fund has, for instance, advised the city of zhangjiakou on how to deliver a low-carbon winter olympics in 2022. the challenge of working with officials is not so much their lack of appreciation for sustainability since many of them are now tasked to implement environmentally-friendly policies as part of china’s national goal to go green. the bigger issue is the high turnovers of officials — successors may come in with a brand-new agenda and drop their predecessors’ goals. “however, if you meet the right officials, you may be surprised at their genuine concern for their constituents and projects and how quickly they can push to implement certain projects or policies,” zhou asserted. the article was updated with the correct spelling of annie zhou’s name.

"youtube will shut off comments on videos featuring “younger minors and videos with older minors at risk of attracting predatory behavior,” according to a statement from the company. it’s an effort to stamp out predatory behavior from viewers that included salacious notes in the comments section of videos featuring underage kids. last week, techcrunch confirmed reports which first arose on reddit about the existence of a soft-core pedophile ring that was communicating via youtube’s comments section and disseminating videos of minors by gaming the company’s search algorithms. youtube creator matt watson flagged the problem in a subreddit, noting that he found scores of videos of kids where youtube users are trading inappropriate comments and identifying timestamps to focus on below the fold. watson denounced the company for failing to prevent what he describes as a “soft-core pedophilia ring” from operating in plain sight on its platform. youtube under fire for recommending videos of kids with inappropriate comments the reports brought condemnation from several businesses that advertise on youtube (the company’s primary source of revenue). disney, fortnite maker epic games, mcdonald’s and nestlé foods reportedly all pulled advertising from the site in the wake of the scandal. “over the past week, we’ve been taking a number of steps to better protect children and families, including suspending comments on tens of millions of videos,” a google spokesperson said in a statement emailed to techcrunch. “now, we will begin suspending comments on most videos that feature minors, with the exception of a small number of channels that actively moderate their comments and take additional steps to protect children. we understand that comments are an important way creators build and connect with their audiences; we also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the youtube community.” the rollout of the new moderating tools will take several months, according to youtube. and while the company acknowledged the severity of the changes and the impact it may have on youtubers, it said it was taking action to prevent the exploitation of minors on the platform. a small number of known channels will be able to keep their comments sections up, but will be required to actively monitor them beyond simply using youtube’s own moderation tools, the company said. youtube also is speeding up the launch of a new classification tool that can detect and remove twice as many individual comments as in the past — accelerating the automation of content moderation (which could, itself, have unintended consequences). in a related move designed to protect children from abhorrent content, youtube has terminated the channel filthyfrankclips and several other channels that were reportedly instructing children on how to slash their wrists. first reported in the washington post, the clips from the channel contained children’s videos spliced with content on self-harm, according to an initial report on the blog, pedimom. youtube kids scare as we noted in our earlier reporting, this isn’t the first time that youtube has been identified as a haven for pedophiles hiding in plain sight: back in november 2017, several major advertisers froze spending on youtube’s platform after an investigation by the bbc and the times discovered similarly obscene comments on videos of children. earlier the same month youtube was also criticized over low-quality content targeting kids as viewers on its platform. the company went on to announce a number of policy changes related to kid-focused video, including saying it would aggressively police comments on videos of kids and that videos found to have inappropriate comments about the kids in them would have comments turned off altogether. some of the videos of young girls that youtube recommended we watch had already had comments disabled — which suggests its ai had previously identified a large number of inappropriate comments being shared (on account of its policy of switching off comments on clips containing kids when comments are deemed “inappropriate”) — yet the videos themselves were still being suggested for viewing in a test search that originated with the phrase “bikini haul.” youtube addressed its creators earlier today in a blog post telling them about the steps it was taking."
"you might not think of self-driving technologies and politics having much in common, but at least in one way, they overlap meaningfully: yesterday’s enemy can be tomorrow’s ally. such was the message we gleaned thursday night at a strictlyvc event in san francisco, where we had the chance to sit down with chris urmson, the co-founder and ceo of aurora, a company that (among many others) is endeavoring to make self-driving technologies a safer and more widely adopted alternative to human drivers. it was a big day for urmson. that morning, his two-year-old company announced a whopping $530 million in series b funding, a round that was led by top firm sequoia capital and that included “significant investment” from t. rowe price and amazon. the financing for aurora — which is building what it calls a “driver” technology that it expects to eventually integrate into cars built by volkswagen, hyundai and china’s byton, among others — is highly notable, even in a sea of giant fundings. not only does it represent sequoia’s biggest bet yet on any kind of self-driving technology, it’s also an “incredible endorsement” from t. rowe price, said urmson thursday night, suggesting it demonstrates that the money management giant “thinks long term and strategically [that] we’re the independent option to self-driving cars.” even more telling, perhaps, is the participation of amazon, which is in constant competition to be the world’s most valuable company, and whose involvement could lead to a variety of scenarios down the road, from aurora powering delivery fleets overseen by amazon, to amazon acquiring aurora outright. amazon has already begun marketing more aggressively to global car companies and tier 1 suppliers that are focused on building connected products, saying its aws platform can help them speed their pace of innovation and lower their cost structures. in november, it also debuted a global, autonomous racing league for 1/18th scale, radio-controlled, self-driving four-wheeled race cars that are designed to help developers learn about reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning. imagine what it could learn from aurora. indeed, at the event, urmson said that as aurora had “constructed our funding round, [we were] very much thinking strategically about how to be successful in our mission of building a driver. and one thing that a driver can do is move people, but it can also move goods. and it’s harder to think of a company where moving goods is more important than amazon.” added urmson, “having the opportunity to have them partner with us in this funding round, and [talk about] what we might build in the future is awesome.” (aurora’s site also now features language about “transforming the way people and goods move.”) the interest of amazon, t. rowe, sequoia and aurora’s other backers isn’t surprising. urmson was the formal technical lead of google’s self-driving car program (now waymo) . one of his co-founders, drew bagnell, is a machine learning expert who still teaches at carnegie mellon and was formerly the head of uber’s autonomy and perception team. aurora’s third co-founder is sterling anderson, who led tesla’s autopilot team. aurora’s big round seemingly spooked tesla investors, in fact, with shares in the electric car maker dropping as media outlets reported on the details. the development seems like just the type of possibility that had tesla ceo elon musk unsettled when aurora got off the ground a couple of years ago and tesla immediately filed a lawsuit against it, accusing urmson and anderson of trying to poach at least a dozen tesla engineers and accusing anderson of taking confidential information and destroying the  evidence “in an effort to cover his tracks.” that suit was dropped two and a half weeks later in a settlement that saw aurora pay $100,000. anderson said at the time the amount was meant to cover the cost of an independent auditor to scour aurora’s systems for confidential tesla information. urmson reiterated on thursday night that it was purely an “economic decision” meant to keep aurora from getting further embroiled in an expensive spat. but urmson, who has previously called the lawsuit “classy,” didn’t take the bait on thursday when asked about musk, including whether he has talked in the last two years with musk (no), and whether aurora might need tesla in the future (possibly). instead of lording aurora’s momentum over the company, urmson said that aurora and tesla “got off on the wrong foot.” laughing a bit, he went on to lavish some praise on the self-driving technology that lives inside tesla cars, adding that “if there’s an opportunity to work with them in the future, that’d be great.” aurora, which is also competing now against the likes of uber, also sees uber as a potential partner down the line, said urmson. asked about the company’s costly self-driving efforts, whose scale has been drastically downsized in the 11 months since one of its vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in arizona, urmson noted simply that aurora is “in the business of delivering the driver, and uber needs a lot of drivers, so we think it would be wonderful to partner with them, to partner with lyft, to partner [with companies with similar ambitions] globally. we see those companies as partners in the future.” he added, when asked for more specifics, that there’s “nothing to talk about right now.” before thursday’s event, aurora had sent us some more detailed information about the four divisions that currently employ the 200 people that make up the company, a number that will obviously expand with its new round, as will the testing it’s doing, both on california roads and in pittsburgh, where it also has a sizable presence. we didn’t have a chance to run them during our conversation with urmson, but we thought they were interesting and that you might think so, too. below, for example, is the “hub” of the aurora driver. this is the computer system that powers, coordinates and fuses signals from all of the vehicle’s sensors, executes the software and controls the vehicle. aurora says it’s designing the aurora driver to seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of vehicle platforms from different makes, models and classes. and here is a visual representation of aurora’s perception system, which the company says is able to understand complex urban environments where vehicles need to safely navigate amid many moving objects, including bikes, scooters, pedestrians and cars. it didn’t imagine it would at the outset, but aurora is also building its own mapping system to ensure what it (unsurprisingly) calls the highest level of precision and scalability, so vehicles powered by the company can understand where they are and update the maps as the world changes. we asked urmson if, when the tech is finally ready to go into cars, aurora will white-label the technology or else its customers will use aurora’s brand as a selling point. he said the matter hasn’t been decided yet but seemed to suggest that aurora is leaning in the latter direction. he also said the technology would be installed on the carmakers’ factory floors (with aurora’s help). one of the ways that aurora says it’s able to efficiently develop a robust “driver” is to build its own simulation system. it uses its simulator to test its software with different scenarios that vehicles encounter on the road, which it says enables repeatable testing that’s impossible to achieve by just driving more miles. you can see a seemingly see a merger happening in the graphic. aurora’s motion planning team works closely with the perception team to create a system that both detects the important objects on and around the road, and tries to accurately predict how they will move in the future. the ability to capture, understand and predict the motion of other objects is critical if the tech is going to navigate real-world scenarios in dense urban environments, and urmson has said in the past that aurora’s workflow in this area is superior to competitors that send the technology back and forth between teams. specifically, he told the atlantic last year: “the classic way you engineer a system like this is that you have a team working on perception. they go out and make it as good as they can, and they get to a plateau and hand it off to the motion-planning people. and they write the thing that figures out where to stop or how to change a lane, and it deals with all the noise that’s in the perception system because it’s not seeing the world perfectly. it has errors. maybe it thinks it’s moving a little faster or slower than it is. maybe every once in a while it generates a false positive. the motion-planning system has to respond to that. “so the motion-planning people are lagging behind the perception people, but they get it all dialed in and it’s working well enough — as well as it can with that level of perception — and then the perception people say, ‘oh, but we’ve got a new push [of code].’ then the motion-planning people are behind the eight ball again, and their system is breaking when it shouldn’t.” we also asked urmson about google, whose self-driving unit was renamed waymo as it spun out from the alphabet umbrella as its own company. he was highly diplomatic, saying only good things about his former employer and, when asked if the company ever challenged him on anything since leaving (as tesla had challenged anderson), he said it had not. still, he told us one of the biggest advantages that aurora enjoys is that it was able to use the learnings of its three founders and to start from scratch, whereas big companies cannot. as he also told techcrunch in a separate interview last year, when it comes to creating effective self-driving tech, size matters less than one might imagine. “there’s this really easy metric that everyone is using, which is number of miles driven, and it’s one of those things that was really convenient for me in my old place [google] because we’re out there and we were doing a hell of a lot more than anybody else was at the time, and so it was an easy number to talk about. what’s lost in that, though, is it’s not really the volume of the miles that you drive.” it’s about the quality of the data, he’d continued, suggesting that, for now, at least, aurora’s is hard to beat."
"as airbnb gears up for its big leap into the public markets, it’s expanding its accommodations platform to include more than just treehouses and quirky homes. today, the company has confirmed its intent to acquire hoteltonight, the developer of a hotel-booking application that lets travelers arrange last-minute accommodations. the deal was previously reported by the wall street journal, which wrote in january that negotiations for the transaction had “gone cold.” airbnb is expected to complete an initial public offering as soon as this year, though co-founder and chief executive officer brian chesky has refrained from revealing a specific timeline. like uber, which plans to become the ultimate transportation company, airbnb’s long-term ambition is to build an end-to-end travel platform complete with home sharing, hotel booking, business travel arrangements, experiences and more. airbnb declined to disclose terms of its hoteltonight acquisition. once the deal is complete, the hoteltonight app and website will continue to operate independently, with co-founder and ceo sam shank reporting to airbnb’s president of homes, greg greeley. “we started hoteltonight because we knew people wanted a better way to book an amazing hotel room on-demand, and we are excited to join forces with airbnb to bring this service to guests around the world,” shank said in a statement. “together, hoteltonight and airbnb can give guests more choices and the world’s best boutique and independent hotels a genuine partner to connect them with those guests.” founded in 2010, san francisco-based hoteltonight garnered a valuation of $463 million with a $37 million series e funding in 2017, according to pitchbook. in total, the startup has raised $131 million in venture capital funding from accel and battery ventures, which have participated in nearly every funding round for hoteltonight. other early investors include forerunner ventures and first round capital. [gallery ids=""1794066,1794068,1794069""] airbnb, for its part, was valued at $31 billion in 2017, with a $1 billion round. in january, airbnb said it was profitable for the second consecutive year on an ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis. hoteltonight offers discounts at hotels in the americas, europe and australia. the company partners with hotels to offer un-sold rooms, catering to business travelers or those looking to make last-minute arrangements. the deal will make it easier for airbnb users to book hotels without planning weeks or months in advance and will help airbnb expand its community beyond short-term rental hosts and guests. airbnb introduced boutique hotels to its platform in early 2018 and has boasted its quick growth. in 2018, the business said it more than doubled the number of boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and resorts available. airbnb’s business travel unit, airbnb for work, also had quick success. launched in 2014, it now accounts for 15 percent of bookings. in total, airbnb offers some 5 million places to stay in 191 countries. airbnb is kicking off 2019 with an acquisitive streak. in january, the company acquired danish startup gaest, a provider of a marketplace-style platform for people to post and book venues for meetings and other work-related events. the company again declined to pinpoint the price, though given gaest had raised just $3.5 million in equity funding, the deal pales in comparison to airbnb’s hoteltonight acquisition. 2019 is stacking up to be a particularly busy year for unicorn ipos, some of which were likely delayed by a weeks-long government shutdown at the start of the year. lyft, which recently unveiled its s-1, is poised to be the first billion-dollar company to exit to the stock markets, followed by uber, slack and pinterest. will airbnb nudge its way into that lineup? we’ll see. airbnb acquires denmark’s gaest to expand in bookings for meetings and offsites"

short answer: no. according to techcrunch’s danny crichton, a shorter term sheet isn’t always better, despite popular beliefs. “here’s the thing, term sheets have an incredibly important purpose, which is to set forth in clear language the terms of a deal. unfortunately in modern venture capital, there are a lot of terms that have to be negotiated in any equity round, from financial terms to option pools, to board structure, to voting rights on major business decisions like selling the company, and much more. simpler term sheets either relegate many of these items to ‘standard venture capital terms apply’ or some other vague language, or just wholly don’t mention them at all.” keep reading here. uber and lyft’s discount war ok, just a little more on the ride-hailing giants before we close out. if you’ve been wondering why uber and lyft have been sending you push notifications complete with sweet discounts, here’s the deal: to gain market share in the final weeks ahead of their respective ipos, uber and lyft have been deploying discounts to riders to encourage them to take additional rides. the strategy appears to be working; lyft reportedly increased its market share from 30 to 34 percent amid the discount campaign. listen to me talk if you enjoy this newsletter, be sure to check out techcrunch’s venture-focused podcast, equity. in this week’s episode, available here, crunchbase editor-in-chief alex wilhelm, techcrunch’s silicon valley editor connie loizos and i chatted with nea’s jonathan golden about female-founded startup cash, lyft and uber’s discounts and more. want more techcrunch newsletters?

"jfrog, the popular devops startup now valued at more than $1 billion after raising $165 million last october, is making a move to expand the tools and services it provides to developers on its software operations platform: it has acquired shippable, a cloud-based continuous integration and delivery platform (ci/cd) that developers use to ship code and deliver app and microservices updates, and plans to integrate it into its enterprise+ platform. terms of the deal — jfrog’s fifth acquisition — are not being disclosed, said shlomi ben haim, jfrog’s co-founder and ceo, in an interview. from what i understand, though, it was in the ballpark of shippable’s most recent valuation, which was $42.6 million back in 2014 when it raised $8 million, according to pitchbook data.  (and that was the last time it raised money.) shippable employees are joining jfrog and plan to release the first integrations with enterprise+ this coming summer, and a full integration by q3 of this year. shippable, founded in 2013, made its name early on as a provider of a containerized continuous integration and delivery platform based on docker containers, but as kubernetes has overtaken docker in containerized deployments, the startup had also shifted its focus beyond docker containers. the acquisition speaks to the consolidation that is afoot in the world of devops, where developers and organizations are looking for more end-to-end toolkits, not just to help develop, update and run their apps and microservices, but to provide security and more — or at least, makers of devops tools hope they will be, as they themselves look to grow their margins and business. as more organizations run ever more of their operations as apps and microservices, devops have risen in prominence and are offered both toolkits from standalone businesses as well as those whose infrastructure is touched and used by devops tools. that means a company like jfrog has an expanding pool of competitors that include not just the likes of docker, sonatype and gitlab, but also aws, google cloud platform and azure and “the red hats of the world,” in the words of ben haim. for shippable customers, the integration will give them access to security, binary management and other enterprise development tools. “we’re thrilled to join the jfrog family and further the vision around liquid software,” said avi cavale, founder and ceo of shippable, in a statement. “shippable users and customers have long enjoyed our next-generation technology, but now will have access to leading security, binary management and other high-powered enterprise tools in the end-to-end jfrog platform. this is truly exciting, as the combined forces of jfrog and shippable can make full devops automation from code to production a reality.” on the part of jfrog, the company will be using shippable to provide a native ci/cd tool directly within jfrog. “before most of our users would use jenkins, circle ci and other ci/cd automation tools,” ben haim said. “but what you are starting to see in the wider market is a gradual consolidation of ci tools into code repository.” he emphasized that this will not mean any changes for developers who are already happy using jenkins or other integrations: just that it will now be offering a native solution that will be offered alongside these (presumably both with easier functionality and with competitive pricing). jfrog today has 5,000 paying customers, up from 4,500 in october, including “most of the fortune 500,” with marquee customers including the likes of apple and adobe, but also banks, healthcare organizations and insurance companies — “conservative businesses,” said ben haim, that are also now realizing the importance of using devops."
"few outside of the food service industry know about olo, a 13.5-year-old, new york-based mobile and online ordering platform for 250 restaurant chains, from applebee’s to cheesecake factory, from chipotle to denny’s and from jamba juice to chili’s. tiger global has been tracking the company’s growth, however. in fact, in a new secondary transaction, tiger just snapped up $18 million worth of employees’ equity. olo isn’t talking about at what valuation, but founder and ceo noah glass notes that the company’s previous investors — rre ventures, core capital and the raine group, among them — have collectively provided olo with $63.3 million in primary funding. and they didn’t sell a share to tiger. seemingly, olo’s traction has given them reason to hang tight to their holdings in the company. according to glass, more than 100 million orders were processed on olo’s platform last year — the same amount that had been processed by the platform across the first 12.5 years of the company’s existence. olo has also outlived or outgrown many of its earlier competitors, like onosys, a company that was acquired by living social and later acquired again by another competitor called splick.it, a smaller, boulder, colo.-based outfit. not last, olo, which sells it customizable tech stack as a subscription offering to its customers, is benefiting from numerous trends, including that people are increasingly eating restaurant food outside the establishments’ walls. according to the research firm npd group, close to half of dinners purchased from a restaurant are now consumed at home, partly because it can be cheaper and faster to eat at home, partly because there’s more entertainment at home (think netflix) and partly because of the rise of on-demand delivery services like uber and postmates. indeed, olo’s technology is largely responsible for enabling customers like shake shack to integrate third-party delivery services into their own point-of-sale systems, so that when an order comes through from, say, doordash, shake shack’s customized olo software can not only process the sale but help find a just-in-time delivery person to pick it up and take it to the customer. we talked with glass at length yesterday to learn more. for a much deeper dive into how the whole thing works (we find it kind of fascinating ourselves), keep reading. our conversation has been lightly edited for length. tc: you started this company back in 2005, two years before the iphone was announced. how? why? ng: i’d been working for endeavor global, which is sort of like a venture firm with a high-impact, nonprofit model, and i got to see and work with a lot of smartphone developers who were working on software before we called them apps. i thought then that we’d all have smartphones, and that when we did, it would make e-commerce possible in on-demand ways. that insight is what led to the first prototype, which i showed to [venture capitalist] david frankel, now of founder collective. he said, “if you believe in this enough to go for it and quit your job and withdraw your admission to harvard business school,” where i was headed, “i’ll give you half a million dollars to get started.” when i launched in nyc, i think under 5 percent of the population had a smartphone or mobile web on a mobile device, so we brought the service to life through text-message ordering first, then it evolved to include the mobile web, then apps. tc: and now tiger is in the olo business. why stage a secondary? ng: we’re in a very good place from a balance sheet perspective, but we now have 175 employees, with around half in engineering and then a big customer success team. and some of them have been with the company for 10-plus years. they’re true believers, and we wanted to reward them for that long-term loyalty. tc: olo sells software as a service to restaurant chains that don’t want to build their own enterprise software to take online orders. but you’re also involved in delivery. can you explain how? ng: first, about three years ago, we launched a service called dispatch that enables our brands to take orders, then get the order delivered without having to do delivery themselves. we partnered with various delivery service providers to create a network, basically, and we’ll find the nearest or cheapest courier to deliver to the customer just in time. we can do that because we know how long it takes for a meal to be prepared based on our deep integrations with our customers, so food is getting picked up at its peak quality, and then it takes 12 to 13 minutes on average for it to be delivered to someone’s front door. tc: and you charge that delivery provider a fee per transaction, sort of like a finder’s fee. ng: yes. we also have a service called rails that enables third parties like doordash and postmates and amazon restaurants to send orders through our api to keep things simpler operationally at the restaurants we serve. every order comes in through the same point-of-sale system. tc: so you aren’t competing with a doordash in any way but rather partnering with it. ng: right. we view doordash as another source of demand, and that’s a good thing for our restaurants. it drives more orders. we have to play the role of switzerland. if restaurants want to work with amazon or with caviar, that’s fine. we’ll work with anyone. we’re a common carrier. we could never say, “we’re only going to work with these two” third parties. tc: how much are you charging your customers, and how long are your agreements with them? ng: a typical agreement is 36 to 60 months on average, and it’s transactional saas, so we charge a fee per month per store — think of it as around $100 per month — then a small fee per transaction for our core ordering platform. tc: you must have tons of data. what percentage of diners are picking up food versus having it delivered? ng: more than 90 percent are customers picking it up. delivery accounts for just 3 percent at this point, according to npd data. it has huge growth ahead of it if you think about it. what’s more convenient than going to a restaurant and picking food up than having it magically come you? tc: but it comes to you at an added cost. if we enter into a longer recession, how does the picture change? how are your customers impacted?  ng: first, officially we work with restaurants that have 10 units or more, though we make exceptions to that rule every now and then and the goal is to be able to work with small chains and independent restaurants some day. and for the restaurants we work with, a recession could be an accelerant. we saw this in 2008, with more customers choosing to use digital ordering and save time instead of preparing food at home or heading to restaurants for a dining experience. fine dining will take a hit in a recession, but [our customers] are selling everyday lunch and dinner choices, and when you have families where both parents are working and you can get a meal curbside for often less than it costs to cook, that’s compelling. tc: do you sell the data you’re collecting from your transaction volume or might you someday? ng: we make zero revenue from our data today and if we did anything, it would only be with aggregated, anonymized data. but we haven’t done anything with it [to date], including because it’s a precious commodity and also because we’e very restricted in our contracts with what we can do. we do give our customers all the same data as if they built their own software. tc: but you can see things that no one else can see. any trends you can share? ng: we can see that the first monday after new year’s is the biggest day for every organic salad chain, whereas at the end of the year, people are eating burgers and pizza and chicken wings and burritos. you see the same thing play out each week. people start the week eating healthy food. by the end of the week, it’s barbecue-ville. tc: before you go, is olo profitable? ng: we’re not in a place of worrying about raising more money. we have no need for primary capital where we are. we’e big believers in this company as an independent company, and we’re building it until we’re ready to have some kind of [exit] event. we think that’s in the cards if we keep doing what we’re doing."
"china’s largest car-hailing company is facing relentless pressure from all fronts. beijing-based didi chuxing reportedly lost a staggering 10.9 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in 2018, according to financial data that chinese news site 36kr obtained. for some context, uber posted a net loss of $939 million on a pro forma basis and an ebita loss at $527 million during q3 2018. didi has not responded to techcrunch’s inquiry about its losses, but an internal letter leaked in september offers a glimpse at the depth of didi’s troubles. according to the memo from founder and chief executive cheng wei, didi had been operating in the red for six consecutive years and lost 4 billion yuan in the first half of 2018. at this moment, the transportation giant’s predicament appears to be multipronged. public backlash the ride-booking app capped off 2018 with a bleak outlook after two female passengers were killed by their didi drivers in separate instances, drawing ire of the government and triggered a nationwide backlash underpinned by a #deletedidi campaign that’s reminiscent of the #deleteuber movement. didi responded with a fold of security measures, including stricter identity checks on drivers and a major reorganization to place customer safety ahead of growth. hitch, the carpooling service that was complicit in both accidents and was popular among riders for its relatively cheap fares, is suspended indefinitely, a move that could exclude the more price-sensitive consumers. cash-burning model didi’s struggles had preceded the passenger murders. cheng admitted in his memo that the company’s expansion was getting out of hand. “the expansion frenzy planted seeds of trouble and our internal system couldn’t keep up with our expansion.” during the first six months of 2018, didi shelled out about $1.7 billion in subsidies for drivers and steep discounts for passengers as competition intensified, bloomberg reported citing sources. in the entire year, didi burnt through a total of 11.3 billion yuan ($1.67 billion) on driver subsidies according to the 36kr report. the end of china’s ridesharing gig subsidies have played a key role in the rise of didi and many other aspiring consumer-facing services in china. investors dole out big bucks for early movers to gain market share rather than strive for profitability. that tactic has helped catapult tiny startups into billion-dollar businesses such as bike-rental service mobike, but it has also led to the dramatic fall of some, mobike’s peer ofo being one alarming example. regulatory hurdles following didi’s safety incidents, chinese authorities hastened their pace to reinforce rules they had long laid out for the fledgeling industry, and some of the policies prove costly to uphold. for one, ride-booking drivers now need to obtain two licenses — one for the drivers themselves and the other for their vehicles to operate commercially. the new requirement discourages part-time drivers as the costs of owning a commercial vehicle outpace the returns of taking up the gig work. didi has tried to neutralize the constraint by offering test preps to drivers and teaming up with car rental businesses to equip drivers with the licensed vehicles. but these moves are set to incur new costs for didi’s already money-burning business. the mobility startup was mulling a multi-billion-dollar initial public offering in 2018 that could value it upwards of $70 billion, wall street journal reported last april. new rivals another stumbling block for the firm is the swarm of new contenders eyeing a market long dominated by didi after it swallowed up competitor uber china. neighborhood services marketplace meituan, for instance, began to offer shared rides last year though it later put a hold on the capital-intensive new business to stay focused on its dining and hotel-booking units. on the other hand, traditional automakers, including a few that are state-owned such as baic, are charging full speed ahead by luring drivers with more favorable commission rates. these newcomers have a long way to go before they could threaten didi’s share, but alibaba has a tool that can potentially help them grow. the ecommerce titan is not competing directly against didi. instead, its autonavi map service doubles as a ride-hailing platform that lets users book cars from a list of third-party operators. the model in effects levels the playing field for smaller players to challenge didi, as they all compete on equal terms to court autonavi’s 1 billion daily active users."
"didi chuxing, china’s dominant ride-hailing firm, is rolling out a range of financial and insurance services as it looks to fortify its service against a range of challenges in 2019. the company announced today that it is adding “protection” insurance and credit services for both passengers and drivers who use its platform. the former is aimed particularly at didi drivers by offering health and car insurance that it claims will “lower the entry barrier for gig economy workers and broaden the scope of protection for more families.” these new options will appear inside the didi app. the company isn’t saying too much about them in detail, but they were trialed in 10 cities last year. similar services have surfaced in southeast asia, where didi ally grab and its local rival go-jek have built out a range of fintech services, including payments and insurance. it’s impossible to ignore the fact that this new didi rollout comes amid changes that could inhibit its ability to attract and retain drivers. that’s because, as we explained this week, regulations that come into effect on january 1 require drivers to hold two licenses, a local residency permit that clears them for work and a permit to operate a vehicle for commercial purposes. that’s tricky, because the residential permit is difficult to obtain, while the commercial driving license adds a cost that may see some part-time drivers decide that driving with didi doesn’t make sense financially. while didi has fought back to lower the barriers by allowing divers to rent licensed cars that it sources itself — “you supply the manpower, we provide the car,” its slogan reads — these changes could spell the end of china’s gig economy, at least in terms of ride-hailing as we know it. it’s hard to criticize the introduction of tighter driver regulation given that two didi passengers were murdered by their drivers last year. the company claims to have instituted a major restructuring that puts the focus on passenger safety, but government intervention was inevitable and it could mean a diminished pool of drivers from which to pick. a didi representative told techcrunch that the company has 31 million registered drivers on the platform, but the company didn’t provide an indicator of how many are active. nonetheless, for those who will continue with didi or join its fleet in 2019, this new rollout is aimed at providing some of the financial services that they miss out on by not working a “regular” full-time job. beyond insurance and lending, it will also see didi offer deals on “new energy vehicles” through its partners. that will cover both buying cars outright, as well as leasing, trading and acquiring on finance, the company explained. for didi, these introductions will likely provide a welcome revenue boost. little is known about the company’s finances, but it is reported to have lost more than half a billion dollars in the first half of 2018, mainly on subsidies. using its extensive reach to help finance and retail partners tap into its registered user base will create a new source of income whilst also providing benefits to those users. government regulation isn’t didi’s only challenge this year, as a number of rivals have sprouted up even as meituan — the deep-pocketed “super app” company that went public in 2018 — decided to pull away from ride-hailing due to financial concerns. traditional auto giants bmw and saic motor — volkswagen’s partner in china — are driving into the ride-hailing scene, while hellobike, which just bagged significant funding from alibaba’s ant financial and others, is entering, too. these factors make 2019 an interesting year for didi. talk of the company going public was rife in previous years, but there seems to have been little progress made. last year’s spin-out of its driver services business — a relatively asset-heavy unit — was tipped to be a precursor to a listing, but already lyft and uber have taken their first steps and didi is reported to have stalled its efforts."
"netflix pulled an episode of “patriot act with hasan minhaj” from its streaming service in saudi arabia after receiving a complaint from the kingdom. the removal was first reported by the financial times. the episode, titled “saudi arabia,” centers around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi and criticizes saudi arabia, crown prince mohammed bin salman and saudi arabia’s war in yemen. the crown prince has been implicated by the central intelligence agency and turkish officials in the planning of khashoggi’s murder. at the beginning of the episode, minhaj, a muslim-american whose show mixes political and cultural commentary with comedy, says “just a few months ago, crown prince mohammed bin salman, aka ‘mbs,’ was hailed as the reformer the arab world needs, but the revelation of khashoggi’s killing has shattered that image. it blows my mind it took the killing of a washington post journalist for everyone to go ‘oh, i guess he’s really not a reformer’ and meanwhile, every muslim person you know was like ‘no shit, he’s the crown prince of saudi arabia. so now would be a good time for us to reassess our relationship with saudi arabia.” he also called on tech companies to stop taking money from the kingdom, an investor in uber and the softbank vision fund (among others). netflix told the financial times that it removed the episode from saudi arabia last week after receiving a request from the country’s communications and information technology commission that said it allegedly violated saudi arabia’s anti-cyber crime law. netflix said the commission cited article 6 of the law, which states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding sr3m ($800,000).” while ostensibly designed to protect internet users from cybercrimes, the freedom house said in a 2016 report that the law contains clauses limiting freedom of expression. “we strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in saudi arabia after we had received a valid legal request – and to comply with local law,” netflix told the financial times. the newspaper noted that “saudi arabia” is available on the “patriot act’s” youtube channel, where it is viewable by users in saudi arabia. techcrunch has reached out to netflix for comment."
"to compete in a world of on-demand everything right to your door led by the likes of amazon and uber, traditional physical retailers and those working with them have been looking for an edge by providing efficient, tech-fuelled delivery services of their own. now, a startup that has built a platform to enable last-mile logistics and other delivery features for these businesses has announced a round of funding to fuel its growth. bringg, which works with the likes of walmart and mcdonalds, as well third-party delivery businesses like doordash, to optimise and manage logistics and other aspects of the delivery process, has raised $25 million to expand its business. a typical example of what bringg provides to its retail customers is the spark delivery operation that walmart launched late last year: it gives the company the ability to optimize driver schedules, automatically dispatch orders, allow drivers to communicate their availability and in turn communicate to drivers by way of smart alerts to make sure deliveries are picked up, queued and delivered on time.  other services that bringg can offer to customers include helping them run click-and-collect schemes, manage “crowdsourced” fleets, and returns. amazon has set the bar high when it comes to setting customer expectations by providing a service that can deliver anything you want in a faster time than it would take for you to go out and buy it. across various markets it sells food, or clothing, books, streamed films and thousands of other products this way, by way of its prime subscription service. a number of startups have emerged to help businesses that are not amazon and uber better compete against them and that proposition. they include companies like fivestars to help build loyalty programs; deliverr (yes, it has chosen to follow the same naming convention…) to help with fulfilment and distribution; ordergroove to build tools to encourage repeat buying; deliv to provide businesses with a network of people to run same-day deliveries; and tookan, which directly competes with bringg for delivery logistics management. and there are more in existence and likely coming down the pike, since every company both worries on amazon encroaching on their business, but also, more simply, will try to provide what their customers want. the reason investors are interested specifically in bringg — which is co-headquartered in chicago and tel aviv — is in part because of its extensive customer list but also because of its focus on the lucrative market of logistics, which is widely credited as at the core of why amazon does so well. (economies of scale is another, which is where being a big retailer like walmart or mcdonalds, or an aggregating platform like doordash, comes in.) “bringg [is] a pioneering company that’s providing crucial capabilities to leading organizations looking to connect logistics data across different silos and optimize their last mile of delivery,” said matthew cowan, partner at next47, in a statement. “with the global logistics market predicted to grow to $15.5 trillion by 2023 and the ‘amazon effect’ drastically changing customer expectations, bringg has a massive opportunity to fundamentally transform the logistics industry by enabling seamless automation, greater data transparency, and a more collaborative mental outlook.” amazon has created a logistics powerhouse to run its delivery service, and the idea is that now other retailers can, using bringg, have the same kind of tools at their disposal, letting them not just manage the logistics for a delivery service, but help companies track and manage goods and drivers, and specifically to do so even when they are not providing the delivery services themselves. this is key: many companies will never want to build and operate their own fleet of delivery people and vehicles to bring things to customers; but they will instead work with the likes of doordash or deliv or postmates to do this. (even amazon doesn’t deliver all of amazon’s packages, but it still handles the logistics.) this will help those people also continue to manage their products and delivery within that third-party service. “this new investment enables bringg to level the playing field in the age of amazon by enabling large retailers, grocery chains, consumer goods companies, restaurant chains and logistics firms to provide their customers with what they expect from their deliveries, based on the optimized business models required to win in today’s challenging market,” said guy bloch, ceo at bringg, in a statement. “we are on a mission to equip enterprises with the technology platform they need to orchestrate successful delivery operations, providing their management and logistics teams with the visibility and control they need to not only survive but thrive in this exciting new landscape.” bringg is already active in 50 markets and the plan will be to take that to more with this series c, which comes from siemens’ vc next47, salesforce ventures, aleph vc, og ventures, cambridge capital, coca-cola, ituran and pereg ventures. bringg is not disclosing its valuation with this round although we are trying to find out. it’s raised $53 million to date."
"after days of demos and announcements and miles of walking, i’m confident in declaring holoride the best thing at this year’s ces. the designation of “the best thing at ces 2019” is my badging. this isn’t an official award handed out by a governing body. this is just me saying holoride is the best thing i’ve seen at the show. this year’s ces is fine, i guess. the main theme is connecting services around the smart home. there’s a huge range of devices that now support services from amazon, google and apple. ces 2019 also featured the launch of new silicon chipsets and self-driving platforms. but the thing that impressed me the most is from holoride, a startup from audi that wants to put vr in cars to entertain and reduce motion sickness. iron man needs help, rocket told me. and like that i was thrust into a space battle against thanos’ bad guys. there was an oculus on my head and my body was dipping and diving, shooting through space, while i was waving my hands around, blasting the enemy. it was straight out of disney world (partly because disney helped with the content). except i was in vegas, in the back of an audi suv hitting speeds of 90 mph on a track. after two laps around the track, i walked away fine. i didn’t feel sick at all, even though i’m the sort of person who can’t look at their phone in a car. matching the vr content to the vehicle’s movements is key to the holoride experience. in short, when the car moves, the content moves in the same way. this reduces motion sickness, and, from my demo, i can confirm it works — at least on me. the technology comes from a small startup recently spun out of audi in a play to put vr in every car. the founders have been working on the technology behind the in-car vr system for several years. the automaker holds a minority interest through subsidiary audi electronics venture, which helped develop the technology. audi will license the technology to holoride and the startup will use an open platform to allow any automaker as well as content developers to create whatever reality formats they desire. i’ve experienced countless vr experiences, and this was one of the best demos i’ve had. the use case is compelling too. not only does it provide entertainment, but it also solves motion sickness. it’s easy to imagine this in an ad-supported format in the back of an uber or while on a long-distance bus. it could work in planes too. it could improve long car rides with the kids. holoride is a longshot and there are countless questions around the content, consumer outreach and compatibility. in order for it to take off, the company needs to build an ecosystem complete with developers, auto makers and consumers. building amazing experiences is one thing; selling amazing experiences is even harder. i used vr in a car going 90 mph and didn’t get sick audi spins out holoride to put vr in every car"
"just as on-demand electric scooters are trying to pick up speed in europe, one of the scooter market’s most ambitious startups has halted operations in one country after its e-scooters started halting mid-ride, throwing off and injuring passengers. lime, the uber-backed bike and scooter rental company that is reportedly raising money at between a $2 billion and $3 billion valuation, has pulled its full fleet of scooters in switzerland, in the cities of basel and zurich, for safety checks after multiple reports of people injuring themselves after their scooters braked abruptly while in use. the company sent out a notice to users — presented in screenshots below, in german, with the full text translated underneath that — noting that it is currently investigating whether the malfunction is due to a software fault, where an update of the software causes a scooter inadvertently to reboot during a ride, thus engaging the anti-theft immobilization system. to make up for the disruption in service, it’s offering users a 15-minute credit that they can use when the service is restored, but it doesn’t give an indication of when that might be. [gallery ids=""1768613,1768614,1768615""] the text reads as follows: by now you surely have heard from the media that we have taken all lime scooters into our workshops and have temporarily paused the service. we have been made aware of cases in which users report that during their rides, sudden brake maneuvers take place, leading to crashes. the security of our users is our top priority and this is why we decided at the start of this week to pull in all devices and do a thorough security and quality check on them. the investigation is ongoing. after first hints, we are currently examining whether a software update could be causing a reboot during the ride, triggering the theft protection. we have already taken measures to ensure this will never happen again. nonetheless, we are testing each device thoroughly to ensure that no software or hardware issues remain. we are optimistic that we will soon again be operating on the streets of zurich and basel and apologize for the disruption of the service. to make up for it, we offer you a free 15 minute ride with code “lime-on-schweiz”. as soon as we are back again. we will keep you updated about the developments. thank you for your understanding. with lime green greetings your lime switzerland team we have reached out to lime for more details and will update this post as we learn more. the cessation of service comes after reports over the past several months detailed how users have been injured after their lime scooters stopped abruptly. in november, a doctor broke his elbow after the speedometer on his vehicle failed, the brakes kicked in, and he was thrown into the air. (fortunately, this happened in front of the hospital, where he also worked.) another rider dislocated his shoulder after falling over his lime scooter’s handle bars when travelling at about 25 km/h (about 15 mph). a third suffered cuts and bruises in a similar incident to the other two: abrupt braking while travelling. lime launched e-scooter services in several cities across europe last summer, starting in paris with aggressive ambitions to expand its business to 25 cities in europe by the end of 2018. in switzerland lime has (had?) about 550 scooters in operation. but overall, lime hasn’t quite hit its wider regional target. it is currently live in 18 cities in europe, and not all of those have electric scooters. in the uk, for example, lime has had a limited roll out of electric bikes and there are no plans at the moment to add scooters. part of the reason in the uk is because that particular mode of transportation is facing some regulatory hurdles: technically they are classified as vehicles, and therefore illegal to drive without licenses on public roads. on the other hand, there are plenty being sold and in use by private individuals who may or may not have the right credentials to use them, and regulations may get revisited. one of lime’s biggest competitors, bird, launched e-scooters in london last year, but it has been a very limited roll out, on private land on the olympic campus. in other markets, lime originally launched scooters but has since had to halt its business. in december, lime, along with rivals wind and voi, were all ordered to halt e-scooter operations in madrid, after the city determined that they were posing a safety hazard after a series of accidents, including a death, amid other safety concerns. we’ll update this post as we learn more. overall, however, the development does not paint a very positive picture. even before we’ve seen a mass launch of actual services, the e-scooter market in europe is already very crowded with hopeful players. alongside lime and bird flying over from the us, there are also homegrown startups like taxify, dott, wind and voi, as well as transportation behemoths like vw, all entering the fray. all fine and well, i suppose — let the best man win and all that — but seeing early versions of these services getting banned by authorities or halted by the companies themselves over accidents does make one wonder if safety is getting compromised in the name of aggressive competition in new, unchartered areas of “disruptive” tech."
"uber and lyft are reportedly going to give money to some of its drivers to enable them to buy stock in the transportation companies’ respective initial public offerings, the wall street journal reported earlier today. citing people familiar with the matter, the wsj says both uber and lyft will reward some of their more active or long-time drivers with a cash award with an option to buy stock in the initial public offerings. uber’s program will reportedly be worth hundreds of millions of dollars; based on a sliding scale, that takes into account the driver’s time working for uber, as well as the number of trips or deliveries made. this comes after uber ceo dara khosrowshahi said in may that the company was looking to offer benefits and insurance to its drivers. the wsj says uber has been looking into providing drivers shares in the company since 2016. lyft, on the other hand, reportedly plans to give drivers who have completed at least 20,000 rides $10,000 in a cash award or the equivalent amount of stock. both uber and lyft have confidentially filed for ipos. lyft is expected to debut on the nasdaq this coming march. neither uber or lyft have disclosed the number of shares they expect to offer. techcrunch has reached out to uber and lyft and will update this story if we hear back."
"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. february is now behind us, but we gathered the troops to send it off in style: connie loizos was here, kate clark was in, i was around and nea’s jonathan golden joined us, as well. it was good to have a full contingent on hand, as there was a lot to get through: thirdlove raises $55 million: direct-to-consumer undergarment company thirdlove raised a huge round this week, picking up $55 million on top of the roughly $13 million it had raised before. the company is well-known for having a plethora of sizes for bodies of all types. the company’s round was one of four from women-led businesses that we wanted to highlight this week. dipsea raises $5.5 million: dipsea just launched, but it’s launching out the gate with $5.5 million in capital. the company’s subscription app ($8.99 per month, or yearly at a discount) provides short-form audio erotica aimed at the women in the market. the company is female-founded and fits into a recent trend we’ve seen of audio content picking up new money as the genre’s listening base expands during this, the second golden era of podcasting. rockets of awesome raises $19.5 million: our third woman-led startup that picked up capital this week is rockets of awesome, which sells to parents subscription-based clothing for kids. the new round contains a strong infusion of money from foot locker, a brand that we’re all aware of. notably, rockets of awesome intends to dip its toe into the physical realm with its new money. coterie raises $2.75 million: wrapping up our list of women-led companies that have raised this week, coterie raised a smaller round to help fuel its instagram-ready-party-in-a-box business. sadly i didn’t get to mock instagram during the show, but we did get to learn all about what a “friendaversary” is. wrapping the topic on women in venture, and women founding and running startups, we looked at a few data points here, and here. summary: there’s more work to do. motif raises $90 million: returning to our running look at companies that have raised outsized rounds, motif, a spinout, raised a $90 million series a. i wanted to know if we can call such a thing a series a, and jonathan told me to stop being such a square. uber versus lyft: closing out, we wanted to call ourselves out for being wrong about uber and lyft not taking shots at one another this close to their ipos via discounts. they are, indeed, back on their bullshit. all that and february is behind us. here’s to march and what’s next. equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."
"menlo ventures, the 43-year-old venture firm with offices in menlo park and san francisco, is currently investing a $450 million fund to invest primarily in early-stage consumer, enterprise and frontier technologies that it closed in 2017. now, it has a $500 million later-stage fund, too, the firm is announcing this morning. dubbed its “inflection” fund, the fund looks like the second opportunities-type fund for the firm, which had closed its first later-stage effort with $250 million in 2016. that said, its mandate appears broader than to simply back menlo’s own breakout portfolio companies. instead, the fund will be investing between $20 million and $40 million in any promising companies that are seeing at least $5 million in annual recurring revenue, growth of 100 percent year over year, early signs of retention and are operating in areas like cloud infrastructure, fintech, marketplaces, mobility and saas (and targeting both consumers and enterprises). the new fund is being led by partners mark siegel, matt murphy, shawn carolan, tyler sosin and venky ganesan, and joined by steve sloane, whose recent promotion makes him the youngest partner in menlo’s history. of course, in 2019, it’s hard not to notice that the partners really put the “men” in menlo, though there is some, small movement toward greater gender parity at the firm. specifically, last year, the firm brought aboard naomi pilosof ionita as an investing partner focused on early-stage consumer deals. she’d previously been the vp of growth at the invoicing and expenses app invoice2go, and prior to that, a product lead at evernote. in the meantime, it’s probably safe to assume that menlo had little problem raising the vehicle, given it has returned a bunch of money to its limited partners in the last 15 months: $2.4 billion says the firm. according to our sources, that money that came via uber’s secondary sale to softbank (menlo had led uber’s series b round), the ipos of both the streaming device company roku and laser manufacturer nlight, and the $1 billionish acquisition by amazon of the online pharmacy pillpack. another menlo-backed company, eero, a home mesh router startup, was acquired by amazon last week. terms were not disclosed. pictured above: menlo ventures’s investment team, across both its early and later-stage funds."
"a big selling point of ordering food to the doorstep in china is price, which, in the early years, could be much cheaper than eating in-house. that’s arguably indulged a demographic of lazy, indoorsy eaters, but that may not last for much longer. over the past few months, users in china have noticed incremental price increases on their meals ordered via ele.me and meituan, the country’s largest food delivery apps. the trigger? china’s food heavyweights have gone about taking a bigger cut of each order — more than 20 percent in some cases — as their priorities shifted following a major upheaval. three-way war ele.me and meituan work just like their american counterparts uber eats, grubhub, doordash and the like. the apps list menu items from an assortment of local restaurants. when a user places an order, they pass it along to the restaurant and dispatch a driver — in china’s case, a scooter driver — to pick up the food. the customer can then see when their meal will arrive through a live map tracking the driver’s movement. this new habit of ordering food via a marketplace app rather than calling a restaurant caught on rapidly in china, in part thanks to vast sums of subsidies from companies like ele.me and meituan to bring costs down for restaurants and users. the market was on course to reach 240 billion yuan ($35.8 billion) in transactions in 2018, with an 18 percent year-over-year growth rate, estimates research firm iimedia. total users would reach 355 million, which means a quarter of chinese are now ordering food from their phones. meituan’s delivery driver pictured in an ad / image: meituan via weibo food delivery startups willingly undertook the cash-intensive fight because they had deep-pocketed backers. for a few years, the sector was a three-way proxy war between china’s tech mammoths baidu, alibaba and tencent, which are collectively known as the “bat.” baidu effectively quit the scene after selling its food delivery business to rival ele.me in 2017. last year saw more shakeup as alibaba took over ele.me, which subsequently merged with the parent’s local services unit koubei, while meituan went public with tencent being a major shareholder. meituan led the game in 2018 with a 61.3 percent market share, according to research firm trustdata, giving it a meaningful edge over ele.me, which alongside its newly acquired baidu waimai commanded a total of 36.5 percent share. baidu sells food delivery business to its rival ele.me subsidies were helpful in enlisting restaurants and consumers early on, but as the market consolidates, investors will likely become more attuned to monetization. it’s thus unsurprising to see both major players scaling back from subsidy-powered growth. it’s too soon to know how the face-off between ele.me and meituan will play out in the next few years, as the duo is now dealing with a fresh set of challenges and goals. new adventures it’s hard to nail down how much ele.me and meituan are charging restaurants from each transaction, as fees vary on the location, type and size of a restaurant. what’s widely acknowledged is that both have been raising commission rates once every few months, forcing restaurants to rethink their strategy for ferrying food around. “we’ve raised all our items by at least two yuan [$0.30]. we aren’t worried because we’ve built a loyal customer base over the years. for those who just started and focus on delivery, they may have a harder time,” a restaurant owner who operates a take-out kitchen in hefei, the capital of china’s anhui province, told techcrunch. ele.me’s delivery driver pictured in an ad / image: ele.me via weibo the subsidy-fueled period cultivated a clan of “virtual restaurants” that operate only out of a kitchen. as subsidies shrink, those reliant on delivery as a lifeline are left with three options: close down, absorb the new costs to keep customers happy or, in some cases where the kitchen is well-functioning, shift the costs to customers. techcrunch spoke to more than a dozen restaurants and take-out kitchens in china’s major cities and found most are paying at least 20 percent of each order — a considerable bite to the low-margin business — to meituan and slightly less to ele.me. the discrepancy may speak to meituan’s mounting operating losses — which tripled year-over-year to 3.45 billion yuan ($510 million) in the third quarter of 2018 — a soft spot that its rival poignantly pointed out. “ele.me promises it won’t further raise fees [on restaurants] and its rate will always be lower than that of meituan,” ele.me vice president wang jingfeng told news portal sina in an interview in january. “meituan is under financial pressure. but ele.me understands the food delivery market is still in the phase of being educated. reaping rewards from merchants too early can do great harm to the market.” meituan said it had no comment on its increased fees for restaurants. but the hong kong-listed company, driven with the vision to become the “amazon for services,” already showed signs of stress when it ceased expansions on its costly new ventures — car-hailing and bike-rental. food delivery accounts for the majority of meituan’s revenues, while hotel booking is its second-most significant revenue source. the company, however, assured investors that it’s in no rush to turn a profit. meituan, china’s ‘everything app,’ walks away from bike sharing and ride hailing “we are not focused on the short-term profitability, even though we have been proven that we are able to do so, to make it — continue improvement in our unit economics. we would rather focus on growth and improve the overall user and merchant experience and to continue to strengthen our leadership in this market,” said chen shaohui chen, meituan’s vice president of corporate development, during the company’s q3 earnings call.  despite enjoying support from consistently profitable alibaba, ele.me will also face pressure soon as parent company alibaba copes with slowing revenue growth. for ele.me, opportunities lie outside china’s megacities where eating via an app is not yet a norm. all told, alibaba plans to hire 5,000 new employees in 2019 for ele.me and koubei to infiltrate the largely untapped tier 3 and 4 cities, a source close to the matter told techcrunch, and the team will focus not just on delivery but also work to digitally power up conventional restaurants. food delivery is just one way to generate income. both ele.me and meituan are aiming to upgrade restaurants the way alibaba and jd.com have transformed brick-and-mortar stores: from how data analytics can beef up sourcing efficiency to implementing scan-to-order for in-house diners. the hope is a data-centric practice will convert to cost-saving for restaurants, which will eventually boost their loyalty and willingness to pay for the tech giants’ tools."
"alibaba has paid €90 million ($103 million) to acquire data artisans, a berlin-based startup that provides distributed systems and large-scale data streaming services for enterprises. the deal was first announced by european media, including eu-startups, before being confirmed by both alibaba and data artisans through blog posts. data artisans was founded in 2014 by the team leading the development of apache flink, an open source large-scale data processing technology. the startup offers its own da platform, with open source apache flink and application manager, to enterprise customers that include netflix, ing, uber and alibaba itself. the chinese e-commerce giant has been working with data artisans since 2016, through support and open source work to help the architecture and performance of the software, both companies said in statements. data artisans is on record as raising $6.5 million over two rounds, most recently a series a in 2016 led by intel capital, but there was a seemingly unannounced series b which closed last year and it looks like alibaba was involved, according to a blog post from data artisans co-founders kostas tzoumas and stephan ewen. now alibaba’s ownership — and you’d also presume, resources — can help the business reach “new horizons” with its open source technology, including moves to “expand to new areas that we have not explored in the past and make sure that flink becomes a more valuable data processing framework for the modern data-driven, real-time enterprise,” the duo wrote. “moving forward together, data artisans and alibaba will not only continue, but accelerate contributions to apache flink and open source big data,” tzoumas and ewen added, explaining that alibaba is one of flink’s biggest users and contributors to the community. to mark the new era, alibaba has committed to providing its own in-house developments to flink — which it calls blink — to the community. “by leveraging the technology expertise of both teams and shared passion to develop the open-source community, we are confident that this strategic tie-in will further strengthen the growth of the flink community, accelerate the data-processing technologies and help bolster an open, collaborative and constructive environment for global developers who are passionate about stream processing and enabling real-time applications for modern enterprises,” said jingren zhou, vice president of alibaba group, in a statement. this deal is reminiscent of alibaba’s 2017 investment in mariadb, an open source startup known for offering the most popular alternative to mysql, a database management system. while not a full acquisition, the partnership has seen the two companies work together on new products for the community, and that’s also the goal here. “especially at times when many open source technologies and companies decide on a less collaborative and more “closed” approach, it is with great pleasure to see alibaba committed to open source and our mission, eager to take flink’s technological advancement to the next level,” tzoumas and ewen wrote in the announcement blog post. moving into open source and infrastructure tech makes sense for alibaba, which is best known for e-commerce but also operates a cloud business, streaming services and more. with a net profit of $2.66 billion on revenue of $12.4 billion in its last quarter of business, the chinese company certainly has plenty of money to pursue the strategy. we’ve contacted alibaba and data artisans with follow-up questions, and we hope to have more information on the deal soon. please refresh for updates. zhou, the alibaba vice president, responded to two questions from techcrunch. when asked why alibaba pursued an acquisition rather than a continued partnership or investment, he said: we are confident in our joined capabilities to contribute even more to flink, both in terms of technology and community development. it is the shared vision and effective work relationship that brought the two teams together. we appreciate learning from each other and strive to make the data processing open source community more open, collaborative and diverse. we also asked how alibaba would respond to concerns on how one of the world’s largest tech companies will use and respect the open source community, let alone a business headquartered in china — to which zhou replied: we have been a strong collaborator with data artisans since 2016, and we have always shared the same passion to use open-source stream processing framework to unify real-time event-driven applications and real-time analytics. both data artisans and alibaba have been participating in the apache flink community for several years with absolute respect to the spirit of the apache software foundation and we intend to continue to do so. from a technology perspective, this is something truly exciting for developers across the globe, who are working hard on an easy stream processing for everyone. for our customers and partners, our joining forces with data artisans presents an efficient option to the challenges that many enterprises are facing in the era of digital transformation, when real-time applications and analytics are often talked about in the boardroom but without a lot of vendor support on how to do it effectively – and in a scalable manner. update 01/08/19 05:22 pst: articled updated to add emailed responses from alibaba"
"grab is southeast asia’s top ride-hailing firm, thanks in no small part to its acquisition of uber’s local business last year, but the company also houses an ambitious fintech arm, too. that just added another vertical to its business after grab announced it is teaming up with china’s zhongan to introduce insurance. grab and zhongan international, the international arm of the chinese insurance giant, said today they will create a joint venture that will provide digital insurance services across southeast asia. grab said the new business will partner with insurance companies to offer the services via its mobile app. chubb — a company that already works with grab to offer micro-loans to its drivers — is the first partner to commit; it’ll offer insurance for grab drivers starting in singapore. zhongan is widely lauded for being china’s first digital-only insurance platform. it’s backed by traditional insurance giant pingan and chinese internet giants tencent and alibaba. grab’s move into digital insurance comes a day after singapore life, an online insurer in singapore, closed the second part of a $33 million funding round aimed at expanding its business in southeast asia. this zhongan partnership adds another layer to grab’s services and fintech business, which already includes payments — both offline and online — and is scheduled to move into cross-border remittance and online healthcare, the latter being a deal with zhongan sibling pingan good doctor. the push is also part of a wider strategy from grab, which was last valued at more than $11 billion and is aiming to turn its app from merely ride-hailing to an everyday-needs app, in the style of chinese “super apps” like meituan and wechat. indeed, grab president ming ma referenced that very ambitious move, calling the insurance products “part of our commitment to becoming the leading everyday super app in the region.” last summer, grab opened its platform to third-parties, which can lean on its considerable user base — currently at 130 million downloads — to reach consumers in southeast asia, where the fast-growing “digital economy” is tipped to triple to reach $240 billion by 2025. grab’s platform has welcomed services like e-grocer happyfresh, deals from travel giant booking and more. grab has also made efforts to develop the local ecosystem with its own accelerator program — called velocity — which, rather than providing equity, helps young companies to leverage its platform. it has also made investments, including a deal with budget hotel brand oyo in india, a fellow softbank portfolio company that has designs on expansion in southeast asia. grab itself operates across eight markets in southeast asia, where it claims to have completed more than two billion rides to date. the company is currently raising a massive series h fund that has already passed $3 billion in capital raised but has a loftier goal of reaching $5 billion, as we reported recently. go-jek, grab’s chief rival, is expanding its business outside of indonesia after launching in vietnam, thailand and vietnam. like grab, it, too, offers services beyond ride-hailing, and the company — which is backed by the likes of meituan, google and tencent — is close to finalizing a new $2 billion funding round for its battle with grab."

"ben schippers contributor ben schippers is a co-founder of happyfuncorp. more posts by this contributor a modest proposal to make apps suck less tesla, a great family brand as the landscape for designing and building technology continues to evolve, so should the process for designing such systems. whether it’s for investing or helping to build a product, it’s important to convey a need for the entrepreneur or company to consider the long term impact of their product and to consider a more mindful and deliberate approach. product processes should always go in this order: strategy first, then design and lastly, engineering.  if you approach each process pillar with “why?” you will end up with a better product, a more engaged consumer and maybe even a valuable contribution to our ever bloated internet. phase 1, product strategy: within the product strategy pillar, it’s important to remember that just because someone can build a product, doesn’t mean they should.  just because a type of technology is available, doesn’t mean it will improve an experience.  purpose drives products, never technology for its own sake. recently at the 40th international conference of data protection, giovanni buttarelli, the conference host stated, “not everything that is legally compliant and technically feasible is morally sustainable.”  in other words, “should i build it?” is a question to always be asked during this phase. a clue to truly understanding this phase is to ask “how different is my idea before starting this phase vs. after?” the more an idea has evolved, the better. phase 2, product design: if designers keep bouncing between phase 1 and 2, that’s a good sign.  remember, ideas that die in phase 1 should be viewed as wins no matter how much work or time has been put in. while transitioning to the product design phase, it’s critical to remember: the consumer is tired … really tired. assume that most conventions simply don’t resonate with the consumer anymore; consider it a widespread technology burnout — app fatigue.  a perfect example of this is with notifications or similar mindless alerts. do notifications make the experience better?  do notifications make users want to use the software or the app?  if it’s a question that’s being asked, then the answer is a resounding, no.  go back to the strategy phase – rinse and repeat. the questions to ask are quite simply, “what will make a user want to come back to this product without notifications or similar tchotchkes?” what experience is created that’s going to resonate with the customer? if an overall user experience resonates with the end user, they will willingly come back without notifications.  this may seem obvious or simple, but the obvious answers are typically the hardest to answer and often ignored for that reason. consider for a moment what uber did for hailing a cab, or airbnb for vacation rentals.  these companies are using a technology to enable a product experience that truly provides a meaningful and rich opportunity for the consumer. they didn’t need notifications to drive consumers back – they provide a service that consumers didn’t know they needed.  it was an original, differentiated idea. the question is does any new leap that hurdle? if developers make it through the strategy phase and understand the core features to be designed, it’s a good idea to focus on new engineering solutions that can help provide safer, more mindful experiences related to engineering architecture and user data. engineering: currently, whether inside, facebook, google or amazon, most user data is stored inside centralized servers. this creates security and privacy concerns. how could developers create a more mindful approach to user data without storing it inside one of only a few major technology companies?  an architecture connecting people on a product via a follow, friending or another, similar, mechanism should have that data be encrypted and stored on the networked phones, versus a centralized server.  in short, passing the user-data baton to your friend(s) instead of a company. while still in its infancy, the proposed architecture would pair well with an overall product experience that is focused on the future generation of apps.  it would create a decentralized architecture that plays in the favor of the consumer instead of the company. it’s another example of a mindful ‘user-first approach’.  a large leap for startups, it’s a good example of thinking about new approaches and constantly challenging the norm, in this case, user data and security. pulling it all together: consider the following case study as a blueprint:  imagine proposing to build an inherently social application.  (this example is illustrative because many young entrepreneurs still have social at their core, and many businesses believe social is still a key first differentiator.) for this example answer: ‘why are you hoping to build such software?” followed by “do you feel this will help people or society in any positive or productive way?” (other than trying to get their attention?) those targeted questions focus the importance of what software has become and its larger impact on society. from there, try to shift the focus from higher level strategy — what are you building and why — to specific features: the design phase.  typically, there’s a friend or follow connection model; a way for people to see activity and some level of bothersome notifications, prompts, or updates. then focus on providing mindful alternative solutions to these standard features.  consider limiting the number of friend requests to help illuminate the product offering?  or if the product is a bit further down the road: consider putting up a paywall tier for potential customers not wanting to see ads.  or: consider not having an algorithm sort content and instead, show content as it comes in or give the consumer the option? companies are beginning to explore these types of alternatives. consider what apple has done for map sharing in their recent ios release and google is following suit. less is more in the current and future world of software design and development. and mindful, deliberate decisions will provide the underpinning of the next generation of apps and larger software ecosystems. providing value in a congested market is very challenging.  but incorporating a mindful approach to product design enables a streamlined architecture that saves time and provides a framework to building products people actually want to use."
"y combinator has been steadily ushering in more and more startups into its classes, but this year the poll position accelerator is having to make some major logistical adjustments to accommodate just how massive its group of startups has become. yc has more than 200 startups in their winter 2019 batch (!!) by comparison, the spring 2018 group was just 132 teams. (for the statistically inclined, that’s at least a 51 percent increase batch-over-batch.) in order to accommodate this truly wild amount of elevator pitches, the accelerator is moving to a new venue in san francisco for its demo day event march 18 and 19. yes, this means that the days of investors vainly searching for parking spots for their teslas at the computer history museum in mountain view or taking hour-long ubers from sf may be behind them. the new location, pier 48, (we hosted disrupt sf 2017 here) boasts over 120,000 square feet of space — though yc demo days will almost certainly be utilizing a small portion of that total area. indeed, y combinator will be hosting a “virtual” demo day online stream for some investors to watch “because there are so few seats.” photo: max morse for techcrunch what’s more notable than the move from mountain view to san francisco, is the move from one stage where all the presenting founders shared their pitches, to two stage locations where founders will pitch simultaneously across the two days. yc demo days brings a fairly ridiculous amount of sand hill star power under one roof and the fact that yc is opting to make investors choose which stage to direct their attention towards probably isn’t the most ideal situation for founders. it is a logistical reality that investors and founders are just going to have to accept comes with having this massive of a batch though. a yc spokesperson tells us that they’ll be releasing the list of companies and the time and location of their pitch so everyone has a few hours to plan where exactly they want to situate themselves. the computer history museum during s14 yc demo days y combinator will also interestingly be ditching investor day, which was an opportunity for investors to schedule meetings with individual startups, yc’s faqs page note that “after analyzing its effectiveness, we will no longer be hosting investor day (as of the w19 batch).” we’ll be at demo days this year as always, and we’ll be typing a little more furiously to ensure that you’re up to date on the latest from this gargantuan accelerator class."
"it’s not only softbank that’s eyeing up the opportunity to tap into the quickly expanding market for e-commerce in latin america. mercadolibre, a marketplace and financial services powerhouse based out of argentina and serving 18 countries across the region, has announced that paypal is investing $750 million, and investment firm dragoneer another $100 million, as part of a $1.8 billion equity offering to grow its business — specifically to expand the functionality of its e-commerce platform, improve its logistics infrastructure and invest in financial technologies “that further solidify the company’s position as a powerful provider of inclusive end-to-end financial technology and payments solutions.” the remaining $1 billion of the equity offering will be offered as common stock, the company said. paypal and dragoneer’s investments are contingent on the company raising the remainder publicly, although judging by the company’s track record as a public stock, and the fact that paypal also announced this news on its own site, it doesn’t appear the parties are in great doubt about the deal’s completion. mercadolibre is traded on nasdaq and currently has a market cap of $21.75 billion. the investment is both a financial and strategic one for mercadolibre and paypal. after getting spun out from ebay several years ago, paypal has been on a mission to diversify its customer base to include a wider variety of use cases and partnerships to power payments for different marketplaces. “digital commerce in latin america is experiencing tremendous growth and mercadolibre is well-positioned for continued leadership,” said dan schulman, president and ceo, paypal, in a statement. “we’ve been impressed with the digital commerce and payments ecosystem marcos and his team have built. we see great opportunities to integrate our respective capabilities to create unique and valuable payment experiences for our combined 500 million customers throughout the region and around the world.” the two have already worked together and the financial commitment paypal is making here not only will help it reap dividends from mercadolibre’s business growth, but also ensure that it integrates ever more of its features in prominent ways to drive more transactions on its own rails. and given how payments is actually more localised than many people might assume, it also gives the company a direct pipeline into tracking and catering to consumer and merchant tastes and preferences when it comes to buying and selling goods and related financial services. “over the past 20 years, we have heavily invested in developing the preeminent e-commerce and fintech ecosystem in latin america,” said marcos galperin, ceo of mercado libre, in a statement. “we are excited to welcome these investments which will allow us to significantly accelerate our growth. we look forward to accelerating our leadership in ecommerce and payments and foster financial inclusion in latin america as a result of our alliance with a global leader in the industry such as paypal.” at a time when more mature markets like the u.s. and western europe are slowing down in their e-commerce growth (while still remaining huge markets in their own right), the opportunity in developing markets like latin america is a big one. as softbank revealed last week when it unveiled its own $2 billion fund to back tech startups in the region, more than 50 million people in the region are now categorised as “middle class,” with increased disposable income. the region accounts for 10 percent of the world’s population and 8 percent of the world’s gdp, two times the gdp of india and half that of china. there are some 375 million internet users and 250 million smartphone users, putting it ahead of the u.s. in terms of sheer numbers. moreover, retail e-commerce has nearly doubled in the last three years, going to $54 billion in 2018 from $29.8 billion in 2015, figures that have definitely fueled mercadolibre’s own growth. in 2018, the company sold more than 334 million items, amounting to over $12 billion of gross merchandise volume. payment transactions on mercadopago, its payments business unit, increased by 70 percent during 2018, totaling 389 million transactions and $18 billion of total payment volume, the company said. at the same time, these are nascent numbers: some 400 million people are still without bank accounts or credit histories in the region. in terms of the other big investor being announced in this round, dragoneer is a legendary and very experienced investor when it comes to interesting opportunities in e-commerce. the company has stakes in other giant regional e-commerce marketplaces like alibaba and flipkart; disruptive “gig economy” leaders like airbnb, uber, doordash and instacart, as well as a plethora of other huge startup names like slack and snap. it seems mercadolibre is currently the top bet for not only competing against the likes of amazon, but a range of smaller local players that are also looking to tap into this quickly expanding economy — in other words, the same opportunity softbank is chasing, but from the other end of the field. “through its investments in fintech, logistics, and customer experience, mercadolibre is solidifying its leading market position in e-commerce and digital payments across latin america, and we believe we are witnessing a major tipping point in the region,” said marc stad, founder and managing partner of dragoneer investment group, in a statement. “we’ve known marcos and his team for over a decade and are thrilled to partner with them through this high growth and transformative period.” goldman sachs is acting as sole financial advisor to mercadolibre on the paypal and dragoneer investments, and cleary gottlieb is serving as mercadolibre’s legal advisor. goldman sachs, j.p. morgan and morgan stanley are acting as joint bookrunners on the public equity offering. as a side note, it’s interesting to consider the approach that mercadolibre is taking with this round. paypal’s investment is coming in the form of a purchase of common stock, while dragoneer’s is coming by way of an affiliate that has agreed to purchase $100 million of series a perpetual convertible preferred stock, with the rest to be raised publicly. when you consider how lyft, and likely uber, and many other very highly valued, high-profile scaled startups are likely also to list publicly, this could end up being a route that we see getting used more often when these companies, which are all still operating at a loss and will need to raise capital, might opt to take, too."
"last july, at its cloud next conference, google announced the cloud services platform, its first real foray into bringing its own cloud services into the enterprise data center as a managed service. today, the cloud services platform (csp) is launching into beta. it’s important to note that the csp isn’t — at least for the time being — google’s way of bringing all of its cloud-based developer services to the on-premises data center. in other words, this is a very different project from something like microsoft’s azure stack. instead, the focus is on the google kubernetes engine, which allows enterprises to then run their applications in both their own data centers and on virtually any cloud platform that supports containers.as google cloud engineering director chen goldberg told me, the idea here it to help enterprises innovate and modernize. “clearly, everybody is very excited about cloud computing, on-demand compute and managed services, but customers have recognized that the move is not that easy,” she said and noted that the vast majority of enterprises are adopting a hybrid approach. and while containers are obviously still a very new technology, she feels good about this bet on the technology because most enterprises are already adopting containers and kubernetes — and they are doing so at exactly the same time as they are adopting cloud and especially hybrid clouds. it’s important to note that csp is a managed platform. google handles all of the heavy lifting like upgrades and security patches. and for enterprises that need an easy way to install some of the most popular applications, the platform also supports kubernetes applications from the gcp marketplace. as for the tech itself, goldberg stressed that this isn’t just about kubernetes. the service also uses istio, for example, the increasingly popular service mesh that makes it easier for enterprises to secure and control the flow of traffic and api calls between its applications. with today’s release, google is also launching its new csp config management tool to help users create multi-cluster policies and set up and enforce access controls, resource quotas and more. csp also integrates with google’s stackdriver monitoring service and continuous delivery platforms. “on-prem is not easy,” goldberg said, and given that this is the first time the company is really supporting software in a data center that is not its own, that’s probably an understatement. but google also decided that it didn’t want to force users into a specific set of hardware specifications like azure stack does, for example. instead, csp sits on top of vmware’s vsphere server virtualization platform, which most enterprises already use in their data centers anyway. that surely simplifies things, given that this is a very well-understood platform. google cloud goes all-in on hybrid with its new cloud services platform"
"a few weeks ago, we told you that former uber ceo travis kalanick looks to be partnering with the former coo of the bike-sharing startup ofo, yanqi zhang, to bring his new l.a.-based company, cloudkitchens, to china. kalanick didn’t respond to our request for more information, but according to the south china morning post (scmp), his plan is to provide local food businesses with real estate, facilities management, technology and marketing services. he might want to move quickly. kitchens that invite restaurants to share their space to focus on take-out orders is a concept that’s picking up momentum fast in china. and one company looks to have just assumed pole position in that race: panda selected, a beijing-based shared-kitchen company that just raised $50 million in series c funding led by tiger global management, with participation from earlier backers dcm and genbridge capital. the round brings its total funding to $80 million. little wonder there’s a contest afoot. china’s food-delivery market is already worth $37 billion dollars, according to the scmp, which says 256 million people in china used online food ordering services in 2016, and the number is expected to grow to 346 million this year. and that’s still a little less than a quarter of the country’s population of 1.4 billion people. panda selected is wasting little time in trying to reach them. while scmp says that online delivery services already blanket 1,300 cities. panda selected, founded just three years ago, says it already operates 120 locations that cover china’s biggest centers, including shanghai, beijing, shenzhen and hangzhou. it claims to work with more than 800 domestic catering brands, including luckin coffee, kungfu and tubestation. the company also says that its kitchens are typically 5,000-square-feet in size and can accommodate up to 20 restaurants in each space. with its new funding, it expects to double that number over the next eight months, too, its  founder, haipeng li, tells bloomberg. that’s going to make it difficult to challenge, especially by any u.s.-based company, given overall relations between the two countries and the ever-changing regulatory environment in china. then again, this may be just the first inning. stay tuned."
"another fine for uber’s historical playbook: the ride-hailing giant has agreed to pay around $2.6 million (€2.3 million) to settle charges in the netherlands related to violations of local taxi law, dating back to when it was operating a peer-to-peer ride-hailing service in contravention of local transport laws. uber offered its uberpop service in the netherlands between july 2014 and november 2015, when it pulled the plug — saying the service “had become a block to regulatory progress” — which is a long-winded way of saying it wasn’t legal to operate it. the dutch public prosecution service (dpps) announced the settlement today, saying it consists of a €2,025,000 fine across the four uber companies — uber international bv, uber netherlands bv, uber bv and rasier operations bv — in addition to €309,409 in “criminally earned capital” via uber’s 20 percent commission on rides, which is being clawed back. the dpps said it’s happy to settle with uber as it believes the courts would have reached the same penalizing conclusion. in a press release announcing the settlement it writes that the four named uber entities “co-perpetrated” the violation of local taxi law, which requires transport services to have a taxi license to operate (whereas with uberpop uber allowed anyone with a vehicle to sell a ride). uber bv has been given the maximum possible fine (€810,000). the other three entities have been fined half the maximum — as a result of smaller roles in the violation, the dpps said. “the person responsible for the rollout of uberpop in the netherlands has performed a 90-hour [community service] penalty,” it adds. commenting on the settlement in a statement, an uber spokesperson said: “we have changed the way we do business across the world, putting integrity in the core of everything that we do. we are committed to being a good partner to dutch cities. we have shut down uberpop services in 2015. since then, we only allow professional and certified drivers on the app, through uberx, van and black services.” also since 2015: europe’s top court judged uber to be a transport company — firmly closing the regional book on any more attempts to circumvent taxi laws by claiming it’s “just a technology platform.”"
"google paid a total of $105 million to andy rubin and amit singhal after they were accused of sexual harassment at the company, the wall street journal first reported. this confirms the new york times report that google paid $90 million to rubin and reveals google also paid $15 million to singhal, who left uber after it was revealed that he did not disclose the sexual harassment allegation. the suit, filed by shareholder james martin, confirms the board of directors approved a $90 million exit package for rubin “as a goodbye present to him. no mention, of course, was made about the true reason for rubin’s ‘resignation’ — his egregious sexual harassment while at google.” in a statement to techcrunch, rubin’s lawyer denies these claims. “this lawsuit simply repeats much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes andy’s departure from google and sensationalizes claims made about andy by his ex-wife,” ellen winick stross, rubin’s lawyer, said. “andy acknowledges having had a consensual relationship with a google employee. however, andy strongly denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court.” the suit goes on to describe how singhal “was allowed to quietly resign at google in 2016 in the wake of credible allegations of sexual harassment, and was paid millions in severance.” in since-unsealed documents, citing documents provided by google, the suit reveals google agreed to pay $45 million to singhal, but ended up paying just $15 million because he went to work for a competitor. google initially agreed to pay singhal annual cash payments of $15 million, to be paid 12 months and then 24 months after his exit. google offered an additional maximum of $15 million to be paid 36 months after his exit, contingent upon him not joining a competitor. “because google’s board concealed the reasons for singhal’s departure, he found another lucrative job,” the suit states. singhal was a senior vice president of search before he resigned from google in february 2016. at the time, singhal framed his resignation as a retirement, but the retirement lasted less than a year — singhal joined uber in january 2017. a month later, then-uber ceo travis kalanick asked singhal to resign after discovering singhal did not disclose the sexual harassment investigation at google. in an email to bloomberg, singhal wrote, “harassment is unacceptable in any setting” and that he wants “everyone to know that i do not condone and have not committed such behavior. in my 20-year career, i’ve never been accused of anything like this before, and the decision to leave google was my own.” in november 2018, google said 48 people had been terminated for sexual harassment, including 13 who were senior managers and above. at the time, google said none of those individuals had received an exit package. in a statement to techcrunch today, a google spokesperson said: there are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at google. in recent years, we’ve made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority. the case is 19cv343672 | martin v. page, et al.

"customer experience management platform medallia has filed to raise up to $70 million in series f funding, according to regulatory documents obtained by the prime unicorn index. the new shares were priced at $15 apiece, valuing the nearly two-decades-old business at $2.4 billion. medallia confirmed the funding. a previous version of this report pinpointed medallia’s valuation at $1.7 billion. medallia is expected to finally transition to the public markets in 2019, a year chock-full of high-profile unicorn ipos. the downsized round, which is less than half of its series e funding, will likely be medallia’s final infusion of private investment. san mateo-headquartered medallia, led by newly appointed chief executive officer leslie stretch, operates a platform meant to help businesses better provide for their customers. its core product, the medallia experience cloud, provides employees real-time data on customers collected from online review sites and social media. the service leverages that data to provide insights and tools to improve customer experiences. leslie stretch, president and ceo of medallia (prnewsfoto/medallia) according to pitchbook, medallia boasts a particularly clean cap table, especially for a roughly 18-year-old business. it’s backed by four venture capital firms: sequoia capital, saints capital, triplepoint venture growth and grotmol solutions, the latter which invested a small amount of capital in 2010. medallia has raised a total of $268 million in equity funding, including a $150 million round in 2015 that valued the company at $1.25 billion. prior to hiring stretch to lead the company to ipo, medallia co-founder borge hald ran the company as ceo since its 2001 launch. hald is now executive chairman and chief strategy officer. 5 unicorns that will probably go public in 2019 (besides uber and lyft)"
"ahead of its anticipated initial public offering this year, uber reported a net loss of $865 million in the fourth quarter. that figure, however, was aided by a tax benefit that saved the company from reporting a $1.2 billion net loss in the period. on an adjusted, pro-forma basis, uber’s net loss in the final quarter of 2018 was a slimmer $768 million. the figures are an improvement of sorts. the firm reported a pro-forma net loss of $939 million in the preceding, third quarter of 2018, but also reported a smaller pre-tax net loss of $971 million. regardless, uber’s stiff losses continued in the quarter. meanwhile, uber’s adjusted ebidta losses came in at $842 million, an increase of 88 percent year over year, and an increase of 60 percent from the third quarter. in that preceding quarter, uber’s adjusted ebidta losses came in at $527 million. these increased losses can be attributed to increased competition and significant investment in bigger bets like micromobility and elevate, for example. in q4 2018, gross bookings (the amount collected before it pays drivers) went up 11 percent quarter over quarter, to $14.2 billion, while revenue increased 2 percent quarter over quarter to $3 billion. year over year, uber’s gross bookings increased 37 percent and revenue increased 24 percent. but as a percentage of gross bookings, revenue declined to 21.3 percent. these numbers exclude the impact of sea and russia. gaap revenue: $3.0 billion up 24 percent yoy up 2 percent qoq revenue as a percentage of gross bookings declined 190 basis points to 21.3 percent compared to the entire fiscal year of 2017, uber’s gross bookings increased 45 percent, to $50 billion in 2018. that resulted in a gaap revenue increase of 43 percent, from 2017 to $11.3 billion. losses also improved (decreased) from $2.2 billion in adjusted ebitda losses in 2017 to $1.8 billion in 2018. that’s still a lot of money, but it does show overall positive signs that uber is moving in the right direction. “last year was our strongest yet, and q4 set another record for engagement on our platform,” uber cfo nelson chai said in a statement. “in 2018, our ridesharing business maintained category leadership in all regions we serve, uber freight gained exciting traction in the us, jump e-bikes and e-scooters are on the road in over a dozen cities, and we believe uber eats became the largest online food delivery business outside of china, based on gross bookings.” other key stats for uber’s q4 2018: gross cash: $6.4 billion in unrestricted cash($4.8 billion at end of q3 2018, $4.4 billon in q4 2017) adjusted ebitda margin: -5.9 percent of gross bookings (q3 2018 was -4.1 percent)"
"today, ipo-bound lyft is announcing monica poindexter, formerly facebook’s global head of diversity business partners, has joined the company to lead the transportation company’s inclusion and diversity efforts. the company has employed a head of diversity and inclusion before, but this time, the person in this role has a more holistic mission. “i’m in a unique role and have an opportunity to help the organization look at diversity more holistically and look at it through the lens of talent, workforce and marketplace,” poindexter told techcrunch. “i’m taking the time to understand the processes internally and identify areas where we can intentionally embed inclusion and diversity into our processes.” while poindexter will report to lyft vp of talent and inclusion nilka thomas, what ultimately led poindexter to take the job at lyft was her sense of commitment from lyft’s co-founders, john zimmer and logan green. “i interviewed with john and logan and was also interviewing them about commitment from the leadership team,” poindexter said. “that was a key deciding factor. i think that this work is difficult enough and you do want to be sure that you have the top-down support from leadership and are open and willing to learn but also to evolve.” lyft brought on tariq meyers to serve as its first-ever head of inclusion and diversity back in september 2016. within his first year on the job, lyft released its first diversity report, which showed numbers comparable to the likes of uber, facebook and google. meyers left lyft in april 2018 to serve as coinbase’s global head of belonging, inclusion and employee experience. last september, lyft unveiled its second annual diversity report, which showed little change from the year prior. at the time, 40 percent of lyft’s workforce identified as female while 52 percent of its employees were white."
"if a picture is worth a thousand words, how many emails can you replace with a video? as offices fragment into remote teams, work becomes more visual and social media makes us more comfortable on camera, it’s time for collaboration to go beyond text. that’s the idea behind loom, a fast-rising startup that equips enterprises with instant video messaging tools. in a click, you can film yourself or narrate a screenshare to get an idea across in a more vivid, personal way. instead of scheduling a video call, employees can asynchronously discuss projects or give “stand-up” updates without massive disruptions to their workflow. in the 2.5 years since launch, loom has signed up 1.1 million users from 18,000 companies. and that was just as a chrome extension. today loom launches its pc and mac apps that give it a dedicated presence in your digital work space. whether you’re communicating across the room or across the globe, “loom is the next best thing to being there,” co-founder shahed khan tells me. now loom is ready to spin up bigger sales and product teams thanks to an $11 million series a led by kleiner perkins . the firm’s partner ilya fushman, formally dropbox’s head of product and corporate development, will join loom’s board. he’ll shepherd loom through today’s launch of its $10 per month per user pro version that offers hd recording, calls-to-action at the end of videos, clip editing, live annotation drawings and analytics to see who actually watched like they’re supposed to. “we’re ditching the suits and ties and bringing our whole selves to work. we’re emailing and messaging like never before, but though we may be more connected, we’re further apart,” khan tells me. “we want to make it very easy to bring the humanity back in.” loom co-founder shahed khan but back in 2016, loom was just trying to survive. khan had worked at upfront ventures after a stint as a product designer at website builder weebly. he and two close friends, joe thomas and vinay hiremath, started opentest to let app makers get usability feedback from experts via video. but after six months and going through the nfx accelerator, they were running out of bootstrapped money. that’s when they realized it was the video messaging that could be a business as teams sought to keep in touch with members working from home or remotely. together they launched loom in mid-2016, raising a pre-seed and seed round amounting to $4 million. part of its secret sauce is that loom immediately starts uploading bytes of your video while you’re still recording so it’s ready to send the moment you’re finished. that makes sharing your face, voice and screen feel as seamless as firing off a slack message, but with more emotion and nuance. “sales teams use it to close more deals by sending personalized messages to leads. marketing teams use loom to walk through internal presentations and social posts. product teams use loom to capture bugs, stand ups, etc.,” khan explains. loom has grown to a 16-person team that will expand thanks to the new $11 million series a from kleiner, slack, cue founder daniel gross and actor jared leto that brings it to $15 million in funding. they predict the new desktop apps that open loom to a larger market will see it spread from team to team for both internal collaboration and external discussions from focus groups to customer service. loom will have to hope that after becoming popular at a company, managers will pay for the pro version that shows exactly how long each viewer watched. that could clue them in that they need to be more concise, or that someone is cutting corners on training and cooperation. it’s also a great way to onboard new employees. “just watch this collection of videos and let us know what you don’t understand.” at $10 per month though, the same cost as google’s entire gsuite, loom could be priced too high. next loom will have to figure out a mobile strategy — something that’s surprisingly absent. khan imagines users being able to record quick clips from their phones to relay updates from travel and client meetings. loom also plans to build out voice transcription to add automatic subtitles to videos and even divide clips into thematic sections you can fast-forward between. loom will have to stay ahead of competitors like vidyard’s govideo and wistia’s soapbox that have cropped up since its launch. but khan says loom looms largest in the space thanks to customers at uber, dropbox, airbnb, red bull and 1,100 employees at hubspot. “the overall space of collaboration tools is becoming deeper than just email + docs,” says fushman, citing slack, zoom, dropbox paper, coda, notion, intercom, productboard and figma. to get things done the fastest, businesses are cobbling together b2b software so they can skip building it in-house and focus on their own product. no piece of enterprise software has to solve everything. but loom is dependent on apps like slack, google docs, convo and asana. because it lacks a social or identity layer, you’ll need to send the links to your videos through another service. loom should really build its own video messaging system into its desktop app. but at least slack is an investor, and khan says “they’re trying to be the hub of text-based communication,” and the soon-to-be-public unicorn tells him anything it does in video will focus on real-time interaction. still, the biggest threat to loom is apathy. people already feel overwhelmed with slack and email, and if recording videos comes off as more of a chore than an efficiency, workers will stick to text. and without the skimability of an email, you can imagine a big queue of videos piling up that staffers don’t want to watch. but khan thinks the ubiquity of instagram stories is making it seem natural to jump on camera briefly. and the advantage is that you don’t need a bunch of time-wasting pleasantries to ensure no one misinterprets your message as sarcastic or pissed off. khan concludes, “we believe instantly sharable video can foster more authentic communication between people at work, and convey complex scenarios and ideas with empathy.”"
"as lyft continues to prepare for its ipo, the on-demand transportation startup is trimming staff to cut costs ahead of another wave of expansion. techcrunch has learned and confirmed that lyft has laid off around 50 staff in its bike and scooter division, mainly people who had joined the company when it acquired the electric bike-sharing startup motivate, a deal that closed about three months ago. the cuts range from managers through to technical people and those holding less-senior roles, and have been made across a number of cities, including boston, san francisco and new york. (the information separately also published a short report about the layoffs last night.) a spokesperson for the company told techcrunch that lyft is continuing to hire in its scooter and bike division. “this was part of our performance management process,” she said in a statement. “we are actively hiring for this part of the business with hundreds of hires planned this year.” given that lyft currently employs around 5,000 people, the cuts work out to a small percentage of that, around one percent to be exact. but it’s notable because of where the cuts were made, and because they are coming as the company gears up for a public listing, after which it will be subject to more public scrutiny. lyft has made a big move in the last year to expand its transportation options beyond private cars. this has been done partly to meet consumer demand in different scenarios (for example, shorter routes that might otherwise be clogged with traffic, or options that let the rider get a little exercise in during the journey); partly because its competitors are also presenting alternatives, which could drive business away from lyft if it doesn’t offer the same options; and — now that there is a public offering in sight — partly to present a more diversified business to the market. the motivate acquisition was likely made for at least all of those reasons. before lyft acquired it, motivate had made its name in bikes alone. in fact, it had grown to be the biggest bike-sharing company in the u..s, with its network including citibike in new york; capital bikeshare in washington; ford gobike in san francisco and many others. under lyft, motivate became part of lyft’s bigger strategy to expand beyond private car services, which also included its scooter business. while lyft is continuing to develop business for both transportation mediums — for example, it added 4,000 electric bikes recently to the new york city bike-sharing operation — scooter sharing has most definitely had the bigger surge of industry interest in recent months. one person who tipped us about these layoffs believes they were made with a specific strategy in mind, to cut costs on the bike operation, which is a more established business, to help channel resources into the costly scooter business. “lyft is going big on scooters and cutting bike people,” said the tipster. to be clear, though, lyft itself did not characterise it that way. whether the two are directly related, it is true that in the next couple of weeks, the company will be kicking off a big scooter launch in multiple cities, with its sxsw presence this year all about the two-wheeled, electric-powered vehicles. other companies and investors are certainly putting their money on scooters right now. lime is now valued at $2.4 billion after raising $310 million last month. bird is also reportedly raising at a similar valuation. uber, meanwhile, acquired jump last year to spearhead its own scooter and bike strategy. all that is despite what has been a very uneven path for scooters. some of the issues have included controversy around safety (for example, lime appears to have a persistent safety problem with some of its fleet; the after-effect of having gluts of them cluttering the streets and the regulatory issues that surround this; and the tough unit economics. on the last of those, this essay outlines how difficult it is to make money right now on a scooter business, when you calculate the average price for a ride, the average lifespan of a scooter and the average price to get one on the street. and that’s before you consider marketing and other costs, and before you have seen the basic premise proven out: that a critical mass of people will use hired electric scooters on a regular basis. our tipster estimated that a typical scooter rollout is making a loss of about $23 per scooter per ride ($2 per ride, versus $25 per ride cost). “better design durability and more scale to get to operational efficiency will address that in theory,” the tipster said, which is likely why hires are still being made, and services are still being rolled out."
"josé ancer is first of all a startup lawyer, with a client portfolio of startups of various stages based around texas and other similar ecosystems outside of silicon valley. he’s also the cto of egan nelson llp, a boutique firm, where he actively is also building automation software to help the firm compete against larger firms. he also writes on his blog “silicon hills lawyer” publicly and pointedly about his profession — and often takes shots at certain practices common among startup law firms, including silicon valley firms. you can get a sense of what’s in the full interview via these excerpts. on not being “owned” by vcs and repeat players “josé has a depth of expertise in startup/company formation/funding issues and is very founder-friendly. he was able to guide us through our seed stage while staying efficient and keeping the billing reasonable.” mary haskett, austin, texas, ceo, blink identity “i believe, and our clients would confirm, that independence from the vc/repeat player community, combined with deep knowledge of startup financing and high-stakes corporate governance (board issues), allows us to say things, do things, and even write things (on my blog) that the startup community absolutely needs to see and hear, but that “captive” lawyers have been unwilling to offer because of the very real risk of retaliation from influential money players who refer them business. i’ve become a bit of a bête noire of lawyers who’ve built their practices by flouting conflicts of interest and working as company counsel despite being “owned” by vcs across the table.” on early-stage and being “right-sized” “i wrote a blog post called ‘the problem with chasing whales.’ it talks about this problem of entrepreneurs hiring law firms that are overkill for what they’re building. we’ve had a lot of clients switch to us from the marquee law firm names, and while the largest complaint is cost — our rates are hundreds of dollars an hour lower because we keep our overhead very lean, while still having top-tier lawyers and lean infrastructure for scalability — another common complaint is responsiveness. you’ve got a million dollar convertible note deal that you need to get done, and to you and your employees, that deal is the world, but the biglaw lawyer you’re working with has ipos and unicorn deals pushing your deal to the back of the line. it’s a real problem. our target profile client exits under $300m in a private deal; which is a type of startup that we think has been very underserved by the traditional hyper-growth oriented law firms in the market.” on legal technology and automation “i spend a lot of time talking to legal tech entrepreneurs, because efficiency via legal tech has always been a core value proposition of our firm. as i’ve reviewed and contemplated various tools, one thing i’ve always come back to is this unavoidable tension between flexibility and automation. software, even cutting edge machine learning, can only handle a minimal level of variation before it breaks down and becomes more hassle (and cost) than it’s worth… some firms have opted to lean very heavily on the fast automation and standardization side, and accept the rigidity that it inevitably introduces into their workflows… we’ve consciously gone a different direction… our clients tend to think that constraining the advice startups get by boxing it into inflexible software (and pricing) is not only a penny-wise, pound-foolish confusion of priorities; it’s also exactly the kind of approach that benefits investors at the expense of one-shot common stockholders.” below, you’ll find the rest of the founder reviews, the full interview, and more details like their pricing and fee structures. this article is part of our ongoing series covering the early-stage startup lawyers who founders love to work with, based on this survey we have open and our own research. if you’re a founder trying to navigate the early-stage legal landmines, be sure to check out our ongoing series lawyer interviews, plus in-depth articles like this checklist of what you need to get done on the corporate side in your first years as a company. the interview eric eldon: you’re pretty outspoken about the state of startup law these days. break it down for me: what is egan nelson doing differently from the other law firms out there? josé ancer: if you look at the startup legal market, everyone knows the marquee, high priced firms. they represent facebook, uber, palantir, apple, etc. but when you pay those firms $700 an hour, as an example, 25% ballpark is going to compensation for the lawyers doing the main work. 75% is paying for other stuff. so then the question obviously becomes, how much of that other stuff is really necessary? our view is that there’s this segment of the startup market, and i call them non-unicorns, that is far more serious and scaled than what a tiny firm or solo lawyer can handle, but for whom biglaw is completely overkill. we see these companies a lot more in places like austin, denver, seattle, new york, etc., and it’s why our focus is on those markets.  if you look at our lawyers’ credentials, you’ll see a whole lot of stanford, yale, harvard, etc., as well as marquee firm alumni. what you won’t find at our firm is ludicrously expensive office space, cute events that have nothing to do with legal counsel, or armies of staff that don’t deliver real value to the end-service for clients. our legal talent is paid very well, but our overhead infrastructure is designed for companies that sell as a private company for under $300 million, or perhaps operate indefinitely as profitable companies. these are “startups” that might be derisively labeled as “doubles” or “singles” in parts of silicon valley, but we think have been substantially underserved by the market."
"when we first wrote about hooch, it offered a fun, straightforward deal — for $9.99 per month, you could claim one free drink per day from participating bars and restaurants. since then, the company launched hooch black, a pricier subscription that includes perks like hotel discounts and concierge service. but even then, co-founder and ceo lin dai was hinting at plans to use blockchain technology to create what he called “a decentralized model for consumer rewards.” now hooch is delivering on what dai promised, with a relaunched app that rewards users for their purchases. “we were super excited about the feedback and response [to hooch black] that we saw from our members,” dai said. “what we decided to do is just completely update the app with rewards for consumers across four different categories — travel, dining, entertainment and e-commerce.” he noted that while most loyalty programs reward you for using a specific card or for shopping with a specific company, hooch has partnered with more than 250,000 merchants (including marriott hotels, tao restaurants, starbucks, uber and amazon). the company can actually scan the purchases made on any linked debit or credit card, and you’ll be rewarded whenever you spend money with those partners. the rewards take the form of what hooch is calling tap rewards dollars — the exact reward will vary depending on the merchant, but the company says it could be as high as 10 percent of your spending. lin dai, ceo of hooch dai said tap dollars are actually a stablecoin pegged to the u.s. dollar, but he emphasized that you don’t need to understand the backend to use the rewards. for most users, tap dollars will simply be a digital currency they can redeem for hotel bookings, restaurants credits and gift cards. “security is our top concern,” dai added. the idea is to access your transaction history to verify your purchases (hooch makes money by driving purchases for merchants), but without storing or sharing identifying information. “when we capture the consumer purchase information, we actually don’t capture any of their names or credit card numbers … we don’t store any identity.” the program also comes with a big perk for enlisting your friends. there is an upfront reward of five tap dollars, but the real selling point is the fact that you’ll get 20 percent of their rewards — not just on their initial purchases, but for the entire time they use the app. if you like the hooch black plan, you’ll still be able to sign up and pay for it. but the company’s emphasis has shifted to the broader rewards program, which you can join for free. drink-a-day startup hooch adds a perk-filled premium membership plan"
"nigerian startup gloo.ng is dropping consumer online retail and pivoting to b2b e-procurement with gloopro as its new name. the lagos-based venture has called it quits on e-commerce grocery services, shifting to a product that supplies large and medium corporates with everything from desks to toilet paper. gloopro’s new platform will generate revenues on a monthly fee structure and a percentage on goods delivered, according to gloopro ceo d.o. olusanya. gloopro, which raised around $1 million in seed capital as gloo.ng, is also in the process of raising its series a round. the startup looks to expand outside of nigeria on that raise, “before the end of next year,” olusanya told techcrunch. gloopro’s move away from b2c comes as several notable consumer digital sales startups have failed to launch in nigeria — africa’s most populous nation with the continent’s highest number of online shoppers, per a recent unctad report. the country is home to the continent’s first e-commerce startup unicorn, jumia, and serves as an unofficial bellwether for e-commerce startup activity in africa. gloo.ng’s shift to b2b electronic commerce was prompted by nigeria’s 2016 economic slump and a customer request, according olusanya. “when the recession hit it affected all consumer e-commerce negatively. we saw it was going to take a longer time to get to sustainability and profitability,” he told techcrunch. then an existing client, unilever, requested an e-procurement solution in 2017. “we observed that the unit economics of that business was far better than consumer e-commerce,” said olusanya. gloopro dubs itself as a “secure cloud based enterprise e-procurement and commerce platform…[for]…corporate purchasing,” per a company description. “the old brand gloo.ng, is going to be rested and shut down completely. the corporate name will be paymente limited with the brand name gloopro,” olusanya said. from the gloopro interface customers can order, pay for and coordinate delivery of office supplies across multiple locations. the product also produces procurement analytics and allows companies to designate users and permissions. olusanya touts the product’s benefits at improving transparency and efficiency in the purchasing process. “it makes procurement transparent and secure. a lot of companies in nigeria still use paper invoices and there are some shenanigans,” he said. gloopro began offering the service in beta and building a customer base prior to winding down its gloo.ng grocery service. in addition to unilever, gloopro clients include uber nigeria, cars45 and industrial equipment company lafarge. cars45 ceo etop ikpe and a spokesperson for uber nigeria confirmed their client status to techcrunch. olusanya believes the company can compete with other global e-procurement providers, such as sap ariba and gt-nexus, by “leveraging our sourcing and last-mile delivery experience in nigeria” and expertise working around local requirements in africa. gloopro expects to hit $4 million in revenue by the end of the year and the company could reach $100 million over the course of its international expansion into countries like south africa, kenya, morocco, egypt and the ivory coast, according to olusanya. a seed investor briefed on gloo.ng’s estimates confirmed the company’s revenue expectations with techcrunch. gloo.ng’s pivot to gloopro and e-procurement comes during an up and down period for b2c online retail in nigeria, home of africa’s largest economy. last year, e-commerce startup konga.com, backed by roughly $100 million in vc, was sold in a distressed acquisition, at a loss to investors, including naspers. in late 2018, nigerian online sales platform dealdey shut down. on the possible upside, several outlets reported this year that jumia — africa’s largest e-commerce site and first unicorn headquartered in nigeria — is pursuing an ipo. but that information is unconfirmed based on a february 8, bloomberg story without named sources. jumia has declined to comment."
"wattpad is further expanding into asia with a new partnership and undisclosed strategic investment from times bridge, the global investment arm of the times group in india. the deal aims to help the storytelling community establish a larger presence in the country where it already counts more than 2.6 million monthly users who have shared more than 4 million stories to date, it says. similar to its recent partnership with entertainment partner huayi brothers korea, the deal with times bridge is also focused on turning more wattpad stories into books, tv shows, movies and other digital projects in the region. this is an area where wattpad has found some success. in the u.s., one of the stories on its platform became the netflix teen hit “the kissing booth,” and other stories have become projects at hulu, awesomenesstv, eone, sony, syfy, iflix, universal cable productions (nbcu) and elsewhere. the company also just launched its own books division to better capitalize on bringing its online stories to print. india has been a more recent focus for wattpad, following its  $51 million raise from tencent. soon after, the company appointed its first head of asia for wattpad studios, dexter ong. and it also recently hired its first gm of india, devashish sharma, who has been working with local partners to turn its stories into movies, tv, digital and print in the region. “millions of indian readers and writers have already found a home on wattpad,” said sharma, in a statement. “times bridge and the times group have an unmatched media and entertainment portfolio, and connections with some of india’s most-respected authors and cultural figures. we’re excited to work together to create new opportunities for indian storytellers,” he added. today, wattpad’s app supports a number of local languages, including hindi, malayalam, tamil, urdu, bengali, gujarati, punjabi, assamese, marathi and oriya. to find the stories that become popular, wattpad relies on a combination of human curation and technology — the latter with its story dna machine learning system that helps identify the standouts by deconstructing things like sentence structure, word use, grammar and other factors that contribute to popularity. “we’re thrilled to work with times bridge to expand our footprint in the region and create more opportunities for india’s rich literary community to tell their stories, reaching new audiences in india and around the world,” said wattpad co-founder and ceo allen lau, in a statement. wattpad didn’t disclose times group’s investment. the firm has previously partnered with other tech companies in india, and has investments in uber, airbnb, coursera, houzz, mubi, smule and others."
"the money is starting to flow from india’s largest startup exit. ola has added a major name to its ongoing financing round after it confirmed that flipkart co-founder sachin bansal has invested 650 crore inr (around $92 million) into the indian ride-hailing business. the deal rumored in january when paper.vc, an intelligence service that sifts through company filings in india, noticed that bansal had committed to investing 150 crore. today, eight-year-old ola not only confirmed the pairing, but it revealed that the actual size of bansal’s investment is significantly higher. it represents his most prominent and largest investment to date, and his first major deal since he left flipkart following its sale to walmart for $16 billion last year. techcrunch understands that bansal will not take an advisory role nor will he be involved in operations. the investment is part of an ongoing series j round of financing that is likely to exceed $1 billion and would value ola, which competes fiercely with uber in india, at around $6 billion. bansal’s commitment comes a month after existing investor steadview capital put $75 million toward the round. here’s what bansal — who started flipkart with co-founder binny bansal in 2007 — had to say about the deal: ola is one of india’s most promising consumer businesses, that is creating deep impact and lasting value for the ecosystem. on one hand, they have emerged as a global force in the mobility space and on the other, they continue to build deeper for various needs of a billion indians through their platform, becoming a trusted household name today. i have known bhavish as an entrepreneur and as a friend over these years and i have great respect for what he and the team at ola have built in just 8 years! i am personally thrilled to be part of the ola journey and i look forward to contributing to their success. aggarwal, ola’s ceo, in turn, lauded bansal as “an icon of entrepreneurship.” “his investment is a huge encouragement for all of us at ola and our mission to serve a billion people,” he said in a statement. “i personally look forward to learning from sachin’s journey, his mentorship and guidance, as we look to build one of the most impactful global businesses out of india.” ola is locked in a dog fight with uber, which has made india its highest priority market outside of the u.s. uber started slowly in india, but it is pushing hard in the country having opened a dedicated local r&d center and hired a country management team that operates outside of the rest of its asia pacific business. to battle its u.s. rival, ola has expanded nationwide to cover more than 100 cities and towns. it has also expanded beyond just cars, developed its own mobile money service, invested in other startups and pushed other strategies to appeal to local customers. flipkart’s exit money may be moving back into the ecosystem, but the company is running without the two men who founded it. sachin bansal left around the time of the deal while binny bansal (the two are not related) resigned following an incident of “serious personal misconduct” just months after the walmart acquisition was finalized. binny has set up a fund — expect to see more walmart capital flowing back into indian startups — but his newest project is a venture aimed at helping india’s most promising founders scale their businesses."
"there is a deep dilemma facing startup founders that i think just isn’t brought to light often enough. on one hand, almost all (and i do mean almost all) founders are reasonably ethical people. they can be over-optimistic, they can over-promise, they can be inexperienced around management, but at their core, they want to improve the world, build something new, and yes, make (a lot) of money while doing it. yet, if you really want to grow fast — so fast that you can go from piddling startup to $1.7 billion-valued banking unicorn in less than four years — then there are only so many ways to do that ethically. or even legally, given that the laws around industries like banking aren’t designed for high growth, but rather sedentary expansion. here’s a lesson that i think founders internalize very, very early: growth solves all problems. and it is absolutely, 100 percent true. growth absolutely solves all problems. want to make your next fundraise a cinch? if you grow 5x or 7x year-over-year, watch as dozens of venture firms squabble to get access to that cap table. want to hire faster and attract better talent? growing at top speed is an easy way to lock in those people. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. and if you think the board acts as a guard rail, you have never seen the giddy excitement of a vc who is seeing their yacht / napa vineyard / atherton estate being financed before their very eyes. boards don’t ask tough questions in periods of high growth, they double down: “do everything to keep this rocket ship shooting for the stratosphere.” in these situations, it is nearly impossible to balance growth and ethics. you can’t just say, “turn on the money laundering thing again and we will accept 5x instead of 7x” or whatever. the whole organism of the startup has been geared for growth. hell, even the people not working for the company (but want to) are geared for growth. every salary bump, equity distribution, performance evaluation, feedback, kpi and firing is predicated on growth. sometimes you get away with it, and sometimes you don’t. uber got away with it, zenefits did not. so where does revolut sit, which i’ve been foreshadowing here? by now, you might have come across the three-part story arc of revolut, a digital banking service based in london. in part one, revolut is a fintech darling founded in july 2015 that has since raised $336 million in venture capital within four years at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to crunchbase. insane growth, huge market, real product. it’s the best first act for a startup one can possibly hope for. then the bad news started hitting hard this week. in act two, we get this wired exposé by emiliano mellino that discusses the atrocious working conditions of the company along with deeply questionable employee interview tactics: she did a 30-minute job interview over google hangouts with the london-based head of business development, andrius biceika, and was immediately told she had passed to the next round, which would involve a small test. “the surprise came when i received the task and it asked me to get the company as many clients as possible, with each one depositing €10 into the app,” says laura. and using fear to goad performance: last spring, ceo nikolay storonsky sent an announcement to all staff through the company’s slack messaging service, saying that any members of staff “with performance rating [sic] ‘significantly below expectations’ will be fired without any negotiation after the review”. … around this time, ceo nikolay storonsky gave an interview to business insider where he said revolut’s philosophy was to “get shit done”, a slogan that is emblazoned on the company’s london office walls in bright neon lights. in an echo to what was going on in these calls, storonsky would go on to say in the interview that the company attracted people that want to grow and “growing is always through pain”. well, there is more growth to come, because act three is going to bring a very painful episode for the company. my colleague jon russell noted that revolut’s cfo has resigned in the wake of a daily telegraph investigation showing that revolut had switched off the anti-money-laundering safeguards at the company, because, well, it got in the way of growth. let’s be clear: we all love a rapidly growing startup. we all want to invest in or join a winner. but what are we willing to forego to get it? are we willing to push ethical boundaries? are we willing to use dark patterns to force those numbers higher? are we willing to break the law and potentially go to prison? our love of growth often knows no bounds. in context, i’m sure revolut’s decision came easily, but of course, for disinterested observers, the idea that you would switch off the aml system at a banking startup just looks like complete stupidity. yet, i am not sure i am ready to blame the employees of revolut (or its leaders, frankly) before i place the blame on a culture that demands extreme growth and dislikes it when the consequences come to bear. you can’t get extreme growth without something breaking. we need to decide which value is more important for us. extra crunch ethics series not sure we are going to be able to answer all the questions posed by revolut, but extra crunch will be hosting a series of dialogues around tech ethics in the coming weeks that will try to parse some of the tough challenges that come from technology and startups these days. stay tuned. why fundamental self-interest causes u.s. infrastructure to fall flat on its face simon mcgill via getty images written by arman tabatabai yesterday, dj gribbin, a fellow at brookings and a senior u.s. government infrastructure official, published an op-ed in which he attributes the u.s.’ infrastructure struggles largely to 1) a misunderstanding of federal fund availability, 2) the fragmentation and variability of local infrastructure needs and 3) misaligned incentives for local politicians and contractors. local politicians push heavily for the federal government to cover a portion of their bill, advertising the money as free to their constituents. in reality, investing federal funds is a zero-sum game that requires either more taxation, higher debt or pulling money from elsewhere. what results are the competitive bid and bureaucratic review processes we discussed earlier this week that ultimately lead to gamesmanship and misinformation. the federal-local coordination has grown more difficult as projects have become more localized with region-specific needs and benefits, compared to national projects of old like the highway system. now, executing local developments depends on coordination between federal, state and local governments, leading to the political pissing contests we all know and love. in gribbin’s mind, the biggest flaw in the u.s.’ approach to infrastructure — also raised in our conversation with infrastructure expert phil plotch — is the misaligned incentive system that encourages bad behavior from all parties. the complexity of approval and funding processes causes local politicians to either delay projects as they lobby for federal funding or to “overpromise and underdeliver” on costs and benefits to push a project through. similarly, competitive rfp bidding used to reduce cost estimates encourages contractors to similarly overpromise, leading to plan revisions, construction issues and delays that seem to be inevitable for every major project. clearly more needs to be done to align the incentives of each of these players. software and infrastructure jaylazarin via getty images written by arman tabatabai new york city rail operators grew frustrated this week with the contractors hired to install a new safety system. fumbled management and failed execution on what was thought to be a simple tech integration have caused multi-year delays, potentially pushing completion past the deadline set by the federal railroad administration for railroads across the country to upgrade their safety systems. only about one-tenth of the mandated rails had successfully upgraded their system as of last year as local agencies continue to struggle with designing software and hardware platforms compatible with other trains that may use their lines. that pattern is also found in new york. from the wall street journal article: the projects have suffered a series of setbacks because of understaffing by the contractors as well as software and hardware failures. those failures include the recall of antennas that were installed on more than 1,000 rail cars and that were later found to be defective. “it was a novice error and we did not believe we had hired novices,” mta board member susan metzger said. the new york project mimics issues plaguing projects throughout the u.s., where contractors use the “overpromise, underdeliver” strategy to win competitive bids. add in software incompetence and you get the mess that new york is facing now. dc commutes suck more than in nyc and sf, even before amazon materializes richard sharrocks via getty images written by arman tabatabai according to a new data set from bloomberg, the cost of commuting into washington, d.c. is higher than any other metro in the u.s. though density is clearly a factor here, workers in the greater d.c. area face the longest commute time in the country at nearly 80 minutes on average. bloomberg then derived a “score” for the opportunity cost of commutes based on average annual incomes and average total annual commuting hours per worker, weighted based for other externalities such as how early or late average departures were. d.c. is in the midst of seriously expanding its metrorail system but, unsurprisingly, the project has gone far from smoothly. bloomberg’s findings stress the need for an improved transit system in the region, but based on precedent and progress to date it’s unclear if and when the full expansion will be complete and at what ungodly cost. we’re planning on diving deeper into d.c.’s metrorail expansion project as we read the great society subway by zachary schrag, which just arrived at extra crunch hq this week. obsessions we have a bit of a theme around

"alphabet’s self-driving vehicle subsidiary waymo may raise outside capital for the first time at a valuation “at least several times” that of cruise, the general motors-owned autonomous vehicle business worth nearly $15 billion, according to a report published by the information on monday. we’ve reached out to our sources to confirm. waymo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. waymo, which is currently celebrating its 10-year anniversary, is a cash-intensive unit. raising capital from outside investors, a move said to be encouraged by chief financial officer ruth porat, would help limit costs and would allow alphabet the opportunity to display waymo’s valuation for the first time in several years. alphabet, however, does not want to relinquish too much equity in the business, formerly known as “project chauffeur,” per the information’s reporting. waymo, years ago, was valued at $4.5 billion, though analysts claim it could surpass a valuation as high as $175 billion based on future revenue estimates. for context, a valuation north of $100 billion puts waymo significantly ahead of uber, tesla, gm and ford. google, currently touting an $817 billion market cap, can afford to support waymo. this, however, is not the search engine’s first time seeking third-party investors for its very own moonshot bets rather than continuing to deploy solely its own capital to the businesses. both verily, a google-owned life sciences research and engineering organization, and makani, a wind energy business also spun out of google x, have sold equity to silver lake and shell, respectively. cruise, for its part, has similarly sought outside capital since being acquired by gm in 2016 for $581 million. in mid-2018, the vision fund invested $2.25 billion in cruise, giving softbank a nearly 20 percent stake in gm’s self-driving business. waymo became a standalone business in 2016 and is today managed by chief executive officer john krafcik, porat and chief technology officer dmitri dolgov. the company made headlines late last year when it launched waymo one, a commercial robotaxi service in the phoenix area — its first profitable endeavor. more recently, waymo announced it would sell its custom light detection and ranging sensors, or lidar, to companies outside the self-driving car industry in another move toward profitability. according to estimates, waymo could book $114 billion in revenue in 2030. waymo cto on the company’s past, present and what comes next"
"spotify is taking off its gloves in what has up to now been a behind-the-scenes tug-of-war with apple, where it competes against apple music but also relies heavily on the company for distribution of its app on ios devices. today ceo daniel ek announced that his company has filed with the european commission a complaint against the iphone giant over how apple has “introduced rules to the app store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience—essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.” while the ec complaint is confidential, so will not be shared publicly, spotify has created a public site, appropriately called time to play fair, which details all of the ways in which apple has “tilted the playing field,” in the words of spotify general counsel horacio gutierrez in remarks, “in a set of ever increasing restrictions.” the company has not specified damages, but believes that “we could have been even more successful” had it not been restricted. notably, on google play, spotify is not required to use google’s payment system and is allowed to offer a choice to users. “the situation is completely different.” ek said the complaint and request for regulatory interference to ensure fair competition comes “after trying unsuccessfully to resolve the issues directly with apple.” one crucial issue: apple’s high fees for accepting payments in apps, a 30 percent tariff, which he refers to as the “apple tax.” the base of spotify’s claim is that the company wants to be treated like “numerous other apps on the app store, like uber or deliveroo, who aren’t subject to the apple tax and therefore don’t have the same restrictions.” gutierrez declined to say if spotify had talked with other companies to join the suit. “we know others feel equally frustrated with [apple’s] restrictions… but we will not speak for them,” he told techcrunch in response to the question. he added that the ec will likely seek input from others as part of its investigation, which could be one way that other companies become part of this complaint. in his blog post announcing the suit, ek detailed three requests to the commission: that people not be forced — “locked in” — to apple’s payment platform and tariffs that it dictates; that apps compete on merits and just who owns the app store, specifically apple music should be subject to the same rules as spotify; and finally that app stores should not be able to control communications between users and app publishers, “including placing unfair restrictions on marketing and promotions that benefit consumers.” consumers and innovators win on a level playing field this is a huge move for spotify to make. a lot of developers have made noise about apple’s policies, but generally it holds a lot of power and so many are careful to limit how much they complain. spotify is the biggest company so far to speak out, and, more to the point, formally file a regulatory complaint over how apple treats developers. the move underscores how the two companies have long been frenemies — spotify relies on apple for distribution of its app, but at the same time the two are in hot competition in the music streaming market, an area that is only going to become more fraught with tension as apple continues its strategy of building up its services and content businesses to offset slowing growth in hardware sales. the company is expected to announce a new slate of entertainment services in an event on march 25, although gutierrez said that timing was “just coincidental.” the complaint extends to a range of business initiatives, not just payments. “we’re pretty much on every speaker or wearable out there except for apple’s,” gutierrez noted in the press conference today. but spotify is not the only one that’s been looking for alternatives while at the same time continuing to play in apple’s walled garden. netflix, similar to spotify, has been bypassing apple’s subscription model, which requires the app developer to pay apple a fee for charging users to use the service by asking users to pay outside of the app. this works to some extent, but making it harder to pay will also put some buyers off. for now, spotify’s billing gripes will mostly concern subscriptions, which fall under a 30/70 revenue split (spotify getting 70 percent) for the first year, with that figure changing to 85 percent in subsequent years. but presumably it’s also laying the groundwork for how that will become an even bigger problem down the line for in-app purchases of one-off items, such as podcasts. last month, the company made waves when it announced it would acquire a pair of startups, gimlet and anchor, for about $400 million to further its ambitions in spoken word content, and to diversify its business into more than music (and specifically costly licensing deals with record labels). the company has continued to see business grow for its existing products. in q4 it noted that monthly active users were up 20 percent to 207 million, but it also missed analyst expectations on revenues of $1.7 billion. although its own video ambitions have not expanded too much (yet) beyond a small selection of music-related content, it has also teamed up with hulu to expand its offerings with bundles. that could, at some point, also see spotify looking to offer more à la carte content alongside subscriptions. we are now listening to the conference call from spotify and will update this post as we learn more."
"visual search engine pinterest has joined a long list of high-flying technology companies planning to go public in 2019. the business has confidentially submitted paperwork to the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering slated for later this year, according to a report from the wall street journal. pinterest declined to comment. founded in 2008 by ben silbermann, earlier reports indicated the company was planning to debut on the stock market in april. in late january, pinterest took its first official step toward a 2019 ipo, hiring goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase as lead underwriters for its offering. the company garnered a $12.3 billion valuation in 2017 with a $150 million financing. touting 250 million monthly active users, pinterest has raised nearly $1.5 billion in venture capital funding from key stakeholders bessemer venture partners, andreessen horowitz, firstmark capital, fidelity and sv angel. the business brought in some $700 million in ad revenue in 2018, per reports, a 50 percent increase year-over-year. pinterest employs 1,600 people across 13 cities, including chicago, london, paris, são paulo, berlin and tokyo. the company says half its users live outside the u.s. pinterest will likely follow lyft, uber and slack to the public markets, which have all filed confidential paperwork for ipos or, in slack’s case, a reported direct listing, expected in the coming months. pinterest puts an ipo on its pinboard, hiring goldman sachs and jpmorgan to lead an offering this year"
"lyft is gearing up to roll out its next generation of shared scooters in partnership with segway ninebot. this comes on the heels of segway-ninebot’s announcement of its newest scooter, the model max. the model max was designed with the realization that wear and tear is a major issue for shared electric scooter services. it’s supposed to be stronger, have a better rider experience and more operational efficiency, with a battery that can last 37.5 miles on a single charge, compared to just 15 miles. to help with bumpy roads, the model max features air-filled, 10-inch front and rear wheels, versus 8-inch ones. the scooters also feature a wider baseboard. lyft first launched its electric scooters in denver, colo. back in september. since then, lyft has brought its scooters to eight additional markets in the u.s. lyft plans to deploy its new scooters “in the coming months,” lyft head of brand for bikes and scooters ethan eyler told techcrunch at a lyft hub in las vegas. more specifically, eyler said it’d be the latter half of q1 or early q2.lyft also plans to deploy some segway-ninebot scooters with swappable batteries “soon,” eyler said. “i think we’re learning, you know,” eyler said. “i mean, this scooter is the result of a lot of learnings that we’ve done and seeing how the scooters hold up. and with the entire strategy behind charging and swappable batteries and charging, we’re learning from all of that to kind of get to our ultimate plan.” swappable batteries can be a useful way to increase vehicle availability and overall vehicle downtime spent charging batteries. last month, skip unveiled a new scooter with swappable batteries for those exact reasons. when lyft first launched its scooters, it relied on ones from xiaomi. not too long after, in october, xiaomi sent a cease-and-desist letter to lyft, demanding the company stop using its scooters. lyft now says it doesn’t have any plans to add any additional xiaomi scooters to its fleet. it’s worth noting xiaomi is a minority shareholder in segway-ninebot, and one of its early strategic investors, but segway operates independently of xiaomi. other scooter companies that rely on segway-ninebot include lime, the now ford-owned spin and uber’s jump bike and scooter brand. meanwhile, bird has a partnership with xiaomi for its electric scooters. moving forward, lyft has yet to determine if it will work with additional manufacturing partners. electric scooters are flimsy, so superpedestrian is making more robust ones to sell to operators “i think it’s still to be determined,” eyler said, “looking at all the potential partners, segway-ninebot, in our opinion, builds the best scooters in the market.” in addition to new scooters, lyft is working on docking systems for scooters. this was inspired by lyft’s acquisition of dock-based bike-share system motivate, eyler said. “a lot of the cities we’ve spoken with are very excited about this concept,” eyler said. that’s because docks can be a way to provide some order to electric scooter parking, while also providing some assurance to riders that there will be scooters where they expect them to be, eyler said. still, riders won’t be required to dock scooters in these stations. they also won’t be required to lock the scooters, despite concerns of theft. “i mean, [theft] definitely occurs,” eyler said. “you’re never going to be able to stop all bad actors. we also think this is just a much more prominent vehicle and it feels less of something you could pick up and carry off. our hope is that will cut down on [theft].” locks are not completely off the table, eyler said, but lyft is not currently developing locking mechanisms. to read about how we got to where we are today, check out a recap of the year of scooters below. the electric scooter wars of 2018"
