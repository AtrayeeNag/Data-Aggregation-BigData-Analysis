"a first batch of monthly progress reports from tech giants and advertising companies on what they’re doing to help fight online disinformation have been published by the european commission. platforms including facebook, google and twitter signed up to a voluntary eu code of practice on the issue last year. the first reports cover measures taken by platforms up to december 31, 2018. the implementation reports are intended to detail progress towards the goal of putting the squeeze on disinformation — such as by proactively identifying and removing fake accounts — but the european commission has today called for tech firms to intensify their efforts, warning that more needs to be done in the run up to the 2019 european parliament elections, which take place in may. the commission announced a multi-pronged action plan on disinformation two months ago, urging greater co-ordination on the issue between eu member states and pushing for efforts to raise awareness and encourage critical thinking among the region’s people. but it also heaped pressure on tech companies, especially, warning it wanted to see rapid action and progress. a month on and it sounds less than impressed with tech giants’ ‘progress’ on the issue. mozilla also signed up to the voluntary code of practice, and all the signatories committed to take broad-brush action to try to combat disinformation. although, as we reported at the time, the code suffered from a failure to nail down terms and requirements — suggesting not only that measuring progress would be tricky but that progress itself might prove an elusive and slippery animal. the first response certainly looks to be a mixed bag. which is perhaps expected given the overarching difficulty of attacking a complex and multi-faceted problem like disinformation quickly. though there’s also little doubt that opaque platforms used to getting their own way with data and content are going to be dragged kicking and screaming towards greater transparency. hence it suits their purpose to be able to produce multi-page chronicles of ‘steps taken’, which allows them to project an aura of action — while continuing to indulge in their preferred foot-drag. the guardian reports especially critical comments made by the commission vis-a-vis facebook’s response, for example — with julian king saying at today’s press conference that the company still hasn’t given independent researchers access to its data. “we need to do something about that,” he added. here’s the commission’s brief rundown of what’s been done by tech firms but with emphasis firmly placed on what’s yet to be done: facebook has taken or is taking measures towards the implementation of all of the commitments but now needs to provide greater clarity on how the social network will deploy its consumer empowerment tools and boost cooperation with fact-checkers and the research community across the whole eu. google has taken steps to implement all its commitments, in particular those designed to improve the scrutiny of ad placements, transparency of political advertisement and providing users with information, tools and support to empower them in their online experience. however some tools are only available in a small number of member states. the commission also calls on the online search engine to support research actions on a wider scale. twitter has prioritised actions against malicious actors, closing fake or suspicious accounts and automated systems/bots. still, more information is needed on how this will restrict persistent purveyors of disinformation from promoting their tweets. mozilla is about to launch an upgraded version of its browser to block cross-site tracking by default but the online browser should be more concrete on how this will limit the information revealed about users’ browsing activities, which could potentially be used for disinformation campaigns. commenting in a statement, mariya gabriel, commissioner for digital economy and society, said: “today’s reports rightly focus on urgent actions, such as taking down fake accounts. it is a good start. now i expect the signatories to intensify their monitoring and reporting and increase their cooperation with fact-checkers and research community. we need to ensure our citizens’ access to quality and objective information allowing them to make informed choices.” strip out the diplomatic fillip and the message boils down to: must do better, fast. all of which explains why facebook got out ahead of the commission’s publication of the reports by putting its fresh-in-post european politician turned head of global comms, nick clegg, on a podium in brussels yesterday — in an attempt to control the pr message about what it’s doing (or rather not doing, as the ec sees it) to boot fake activity into touch. clegg (re)announced more controls around the placement of political ads, and said facebook would set up new human-staffed operations centers — in dublin and singapore — to monitor how localised political news is distributed on its network. although the centers won’t launch until march. so, again, not something facebook has done. the staged press event with clegg making his maiden public speech for his new employer may have backfired a bit because he managed to be incredibly boring. although making a hot button political issue as tedious as possible is probably a key facebook strategy. anything to drain public outrage to make the real policymakers go away. (the commission’s brandished stick remains that if it doesn’t see enough voluntary progress from platforms, via the code, is to say it could move towards regulating to tackle disinformation.) advertising groups are also signed up to the voluntary code. and the world federation of advertisers (wfa), european association of communication agencies and interactive advertising bureau europe have also submitted reports today. in its report, the wfa writes that the issue of disinformation has been incorporated into its global media charter, which it says identifies “key issues within the digital advertising ecosystem”, as its members see it. it adds that the charter makes the following two obligation statements: we [advertisers] understand that advertising can fuel and sustain sites which misuse and infringe upon intellectual property (ip) laws. equally advertising revenue may be used to sustain sites responsible for ‘fake news’ content or ‘disinformation’. advertisers commit to avoiding (and support their partners in the avoidance of) the funding of actors seeking to influence division or seeking to inflict reputational harm on business or society and politics at large through content that appears false and/or misleading. while the code of practice doesn’t contain a great deal of quantifiable substance, some have read its tea-leaves as a sign that signatories are committing to bot detection and identification — by promising to “establish clear marking systems and rules for bots to ensure their activities cannot be confused with human interactions”. but while twitter has previously suggested it’s working on a system for badging bots on its platform (i.e. to help distinguish them from human users) nothing of the kind has yet seen the light of day as an actual twitter feature. (the company is busy experimenting with other kinds of stuff.) so it looks like it also needs to provide more info on that front. we reached out to the tech companies for comment on the commission’s response to their implementation reports. google emailed us the following statement, attributed to lie junius, its director of public policy:  supporting elections in europe and around the world is hugely important to us. we’ll continue to work in partnership with the eu through its code of practice on disinformation, including by publishing regular reports about our work to prevent abuse, as well as with governments, law enforcement, others in our industry and the ngo community to strengthen protections around elections, protect users, and help combat disinformation. a twitter spokesperson also told us: disinformation is a societal problem and therefore requires a societal response. we continue to work closely with the european commission to play our part in tackling it. we’ve formed a global partnership with unesco on media literacy, updated our fake accounts policy, and invested in better tools to proactively detect malicious activity. we’ve also provided users with more granular choices when reporting platform manipulation, including flagging a potentially fake account. at the time of writing facebook had not responded to a request for comment."
"bay area photography startup polarr announced this morning that it has raised an $11.5 million series a. the new round of funding, led by threshold ventures with participation from pear ventures and cota capital, brings the startup’s total funding to around $13.5 million, according to the company. at the moment, the company is probably best known for its photography app for ios and android, which utilizes machine learning and ai to improve image editing. the company says it has around four million monthly active users. this round of funding will go toward research and development, engineering and partnerships, the latter of which are starting to become a big business for polarr. in fact, it’s using the news to highlight the fact that it was tapped to bring its technology to the samsung galaxy s10’s native camera app. polarr has previously teamed with other big hardware names, including qualcomm and oppo. “as deep learning compute shifts from the cloud to edge devices, there is a growing opportunity to provide sophisticated and creative edge ai technologies to mobile devices,” ceo borui wang said in a release tied to the news. “this new round of financing is a tangible endorsement of our approach to enable and inspire everyone to make beautiful creations.” polarr’s tech is becoming increasingly valuable as phone makers look to differentiate their handsets’ imaging outside of the hardware. notable recent generations of handsets from top companies like samsung, apple and google have leaned heavily on ai and ml updates to stand out from the crowd."
"last year, amazon joined the exclusive $1 trillion club. this year, it’s continuing to exude its stock market dominance. jeff bezos’ e-commerce giant accumulated $797 billion in market value on monday, ending the day trading up 3.4 percent at $1,629.51 per share and overtaking microsoft to become the most valuable publicly-traded company in the u.s. microsoft, which shot past apple to nab the title on nov. 28, closed up .1 percent at $102.06 per share monday with a market capitalization of $783 billion. according to fortune, november was the first time in eight years that microsoft successfully outpaced apple in the stock market, following concerns surrounding apple’s growth. apple, for its part, may not see itself at the top of this particular list again any time soon. the company’s chief executive officer tim cook issued a letter last week revising guidance for the company’s first quarter fiscal results. revenue estimates fell from an initial projection of between $89 billion and $93 billion to $84 billion, sending the company’s stock spiraling downward. today, apple failed to crack the top three most valuable companies, with google parent company, alphabet, grabbing the third spot instead. alphabet had a roughly $756 billion market cap monday afternoon, while apple’s hovered around $700 billion. “while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater china,” cook wrote in the letter. “in fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in greater china across iphone, mac and ipad.” as the largest u.s. stocks duke it out for the top spot, we can expect to see amazon, microsoft, apple and alphabet continue to trade places in 2019. apple’s trillion dollar market cap was always a false idol"
"go-jek is extending its reach in southeast asia after its thailand-based unit made its official launch, which included the addition of a new food delivery service. get, which is the name for go-jek business in thailand, started out last year offering motorbike taxi on-demand services to a limited part of thai capital city bangkok, now the company said it has expanded the bikes across the city and added food and delivery options. get’s management team is composed of former uber staffers while ceo pinya nittayakasetwat was recruited from chat app line’s food delivery business. over the last two months, get claims to have completed two million trips in the past two months. there’s no word on when get will add four-wheeled transport options, however. on the food side, get is claiming to have 20,000 merchants on its platform but there are some issues. rumming through the app, i found a number of listed restaurants that didn’t include menus. in those instances, customers have to input their dish and price which makes it pretty hard to use. go-jek’s get app in thailand doesn’t include menus for a number of restaurants, making it nearly impossible to order grab is the dominant player in thailand, where it offers taxis, private cars, motorbikes, delivery and food across eight markets in southeast asia. go-jek rose to success in its native indonesia, where it began offering motorbikes on demand but has expanded to cover taxi, cars, food, general services on-demand and fintech. its investors include google, tencent, meituan and sequoia india. that’s the same playbook grab is using, but go-jek is taking its time with its market expansions. thailand represents its third new market beyond indonesia, following launches in vietnam and singapore. the philippines is another market where go-jek has voiced a desire to be present — it has even made an acquisition there — but regulatory issues are holding up a launch. regional expansion doesn’t come cheap and go-jek is in the midst of raising $2 billion to finance these moves. it recently closed $1 billion from existing investors, and deal street asia reports that it could raise as much as $3 billion for the entire series f round. that’s likely in response to grab’s own fundraising plans. the singapore-based company closed $2 billion last year, but it is looking to increase that total to $5 billion with a major injection from softbank’s vision fund a key piece of that puzzle."
"apple has just bought up the talent it needs to make talking toys a part of siri, homepod, and its voice strategy. apple has acquired pullstring, also known as toytalk, according to axios’ dan primack and ina fried. techcrunch has received confirmation of the acquistion from sources with knowledge of the deal. the startup makes voice experience design tools, artificial intelligence to power those experiences, and toys like talking barbie and thomas the tank engine toys in partnership with mattel. founded in 2011 by former pixar executives, pullstring went on to raise $44 million. apple’s siri is seen as lagging far behind amazon alexa and google assistant, not only in voice recognition and utility, but also in terms of developer ecosystem. google and amazon has built platforms to distribute skills from tons of voice app makers, including storytelling, quizzes, and other games for kids. if apple wants to take a real shot at becoming the center of your connected living room with siri and homepod, it will need to play nice with the children who spend their time there. buying pullstring could jumpstart apple’s in-house catalog of speech-activated toys for kids as well as beef up its tools for voice developers. pullstring did catch some flack for being a “child surveillance device” back in 2015, but countered by detailing the security built intohello barbie product and saying it’d never been hacked to steal childrens’ voice recordings or other sensitive info. privacy norms have changed since with so many people readily buying always-listening echos and google homes. in 2016 it rebranded as pullstring with a focus on developers tools that allow for visually mapping out conversations and publishing finished products to the google and amazon platforms. given sirikit’s complexity and lack of features, pullstring’s converse platform could pave the way for a lot more developers to jump into building voice products for apple’s devices. we’ve reached out to apple and pullstring for more details about whether pullstring and toytalk’s products will remain available. the startup raised its cash from investors including khosla ventures, crv, greylock, first round, and true ventures, with a series d in 2016 as its last raise that pitchbook says valued the startup at $160 million. while the voicetech space has since exploded, it can still be difficult for voice experience developers to earn money without accompanying physical products, and many enterprises still aren’t sure what to build with tools like those offered by pullstring. that might have led the startup to see a brighter future with apple, strengthening one of the most ubiquitous though also most detested voice assistants."
"i can’t tell you the number of times i’ve heard friends lament how difficult it is to find a decent calendar app. the stock calendar apps are certainly serviceable, but there’s so much that they can’t handle in terms of managing and prioritizing tasks. sunsama, launching out of y combinator’s latest batch, is taking a crack at solving the calendar conundrum with a $10-per-month professionals-focused productivity planner. co-founders ashutosh priyadarshy and travis meyer began with the idea that the relationship between task managers and calendars were a mess. devotees to “get things done” to-do apps end up re-typing tasks they’ve been assigned on project-based systems like trello and asana, which just leads to a whole lot of confusion. sunsama’s third-party integrations make it easy to drag these tasks into your to-do list every morning and keep things updated as your tasks evolve and priorities need to shift. “[sunsama is] more than just a bunch of integrations,” meyer told techcrunch. “it’s a methodology for planning your day and streamlining your daily workflow, on your own, or with the teammates you work closely with.” the company takes some pretty clear design inspiration from existing enterprise apps. the influences from google calendar, slack and trello are pretty clear, but the resulting interface all works together very thoughtfully with a drag-and-drop organizational flow that lets you import projects from linked services. it all makes for a very friendly, pretty system that can enable you to fly through the often cumbersome work of populating your to-do list in the first place. the company currently supports integrations with asana, trello, slack, github, gitlab, jira and todoist. while a lot of other task management apps rely on a freemium model or low annual subscription, sunsama takes $10-per-month for their service. it’s definitely an expense, but the founders see apps like $30-per-month email service superhuman as a sign that professionals are willing to drop some cash on a service that cleans up their digital life. the company wants to snag individual users, but getting small teams onto the service could be their clearest route to wider adoption. when your entire team is on sunsama, you’re able to check out what other members of your channels have on deck when they’re working on a particular project. there’s the risk of getting lost in the fray of other necessary platforms on the company level, but the founders think the deep integrations will keep people turning to sunsama when they want to see how a project is going. the startup seems to have taken more than a few on-boarding cues from superhuman, which takes you off the waitlist only after they’ve gotten a chance to personally talk you through their service and see whether you’re a good fit. you can sign-up to request sunsama access on their site now."
"vmware announced a new kubernetes product today called vmware essential pks, which has been created from its acquisition of heptio for $550 million at the end of last year. vmware already had two flavors of kubernetes, a fully managed cloud product and an enterprise version with all of the components, such as registry and network, pre-selected by vmware. what this new version does is provide a completely open version of kubernetes where the customer can choose all the components, giving a flexible option for those who want it, according to scott buchanan, senior director of product marketing for cloud-native apps at vmware. buchanan said the new product comes directly from the approach that heptio had taken to selling kubernetes prior to the acquisition. “we’re introducing a new offering called vmware essential pks, and that offering is a packaging of the approach that heptio took to market and that gained a lot of traction, and that approach is a natural complement to the other kubernetes products in the vmware portfolio,” he explained. buchanan acknowledged that a large part of the market is going to go for the fully managed or fully configured approaches, but there is a subset of buyers that will want more choice in their kubernetes implementation. “larger enterprises with more complex infrastructure want to have a very customized approach to how they build out their architecture. they don’t want to be integrated. they just want a foundation on which to build because the organizations are larger and more complex and they’re also more likely to have an internal devops or sreops team to operate the platform on a day-to-day basis,” he explained. while these organizations want flexibility, they also require more of a consultative approach to the sale. heptio had a 40-person field service engineering team that came over in the acquisition, and vmware is in the process of scaling that team. these folks consult with the customer and help them select the different components that make up a kubernetes installation to fit the needs of each organization. buchanan, who also came over in the acquisition, says that being part of vmware (which is part of the dell family of companies) means they have several layers of sales with vmware, pivotal and dell all selling the product. heptio is the kubernetes startup founded by craig mcluckie and joe beda, the two men who helped develop the technology while they were at google. heptio was founded in 2016 and raised $33.5 million prior to the acquisition, according to crunchbase data. four years after its release, kubernetes has come a long way"
"the founders of glide, a member of the y combinator winter 2019 class, had a notion that building mobile apps in the enterprise was too hard. they decided to simplify the process by starting with a spreadsheet, and automatically turning the contents into a slick mobile app. david siegel, ceo and co-founder at glide, was working with his co-founders jason smith, mark probst and antonio garcia aprea at xamarin, a cross-platform mobile development company that microsoft acquired for $500 million in 2016. there, they witnessed first-hand the difficulty that companies were having building mobile apps. when their two-year stint at microsoft was over, the four founders decided to build a startup to solve the problem. “we saw how desperate some of the world’s largest companies were to have a mobile strategy, and also how painful and expensive it is to develop mobile apps. and we haven’t seen significant progress on that 10 years after the smartphone debuted,” siegel told techcrunch. the founders began with research, looking at almost 100 no-code tools, and were not really satisfied with any of them. they chose the venerable spreadsheet, a business tool many people use to track information, as the source for their mobile app builder, starting with google sheets. “there’s a saying that spreadsheets are the most successful programming model of all time, and smartphones are the most successful computers of all time. so when we started exploring glide we asked ourselves, can these two forces be combined to create something very valuable to let individuals and businesses build the type of apps that we saw xamarin customers needed to build, but much more quickly,” siegel said. photo: glidethe company developed glide, a service that lets you add information to a google sheet spreadsheet, and then very quickly create an app from the contents without coding. “you can easily assemble a polished, data-driven app that you can customize and share as a progressive web app, meaning you can get a link that you can share with anybody, and they can load it in a browser without downloading an app, or you can publish glide apps as native apps to app stores,” siegel explained. what’s more, there is a two-way connection between app and spreadsheet, so that when you add information in either place, the other element is updated. the founders decided to apply at y combinator after consulting with former xamarin ceo, and current github chief executive, nat friedman. he and other advisors told them yc would be a great place for first-time founders to get guidance on building a company, taking advantage of the vast yc network. one of the primary lessons siegel says they learned is the importance of getting out in the field and talking to customers, and not falling into the trap of falling in love with the act of building the tool. the company has actually helped fellow yc companies build mobile apps using the glide tool. glide is live today and people can create apps using their own spreadsheet data, or by using the templates available on the site as a starting point. there is a free tier available to try it without obligation."
"apple is airing a new ad spot in primetime today. focused on privacy, the spot is visually cued, with no dialog and a simple tagline: privacy. that’s iphone. in a series of humorous vignettes, the message is driven home that sometimes you just want a little privacy. the spot has only one line of text otherwise, and it’s in keeping with apple’s messaging on privacy over the long and short term. “if privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on.” the spot will air tonight in primetime in the u.s. and extend through march madness. it will then air in select other countries. you’d have to be hiding under a rock not to have noticed apple positioning privacy as a differentiating factor between itself and other companies. beginning a few years ago, ceo tim cook began taking more and more public stances on what the company felt to be your “rights” to privacy on their platform and how that differed from other companies. the undercurrent being that apple was able to take this stance because its first-party business relies on a relatively direct relationship with customers who purchase its hardware and, increasingly, its services. this stands in contrast to the model of other tech giants like google or facebook that insert an interstitial layer of monetization strategy on top of that relationship in the forms of application of personal information about you (in somewhat anonymized fashion) to sell their platform to advertisers that in turn can sell to you better. turning the ethical high ground into a marketing strategy is not without its pitfalls, though, as apple has discovered recently with a (now patched) high-profile facetime bug that allowed people to turn your phone into a listening device, facebook’s manipulation of app store permissions and the revelation that there was some long overdue house cleaning needed in its enterprise certificate program. i did find it interesting that the iconography of the “private side” spot very, very closely associates the concepts of privacy and security. they are separate, but interrelated, obviously. this spot says these are one and the same. it’s hard to enforce privacy without security, of course, but in the mind of the public i think there is very little difference between the two. the app store itself, of course, still hosts apps from google and facebook among thousands of others that use personal data of yours in one form or another. apple’s argument is that it protects the data you give to your phone aggressively by processing on the device, collecting minimal data, disconnecting that data from the user as much as possible and giving users as transparent a control interface as possible. all true. all far, far better efforts than the competition. still, there is room to run, i feel, when it comes to apple adjudicating what should be considered a societal norm when it comes to the use of personal data on its platform. if it’s going to be the absolute arbiter of what flies on the world’s most profitable application marketplace, it might as well use that power to get a little more feisty with the bigcos (and littlecos) that make their living on our data. i mention the issues apple has had above not as a dig, though some might be inclined to view apple integrating privacy with marketing as boldness bordering on hubris. i, personally, think there’s still a major difference between a company that has situational loss of privacy while having a systemic dedication to privacy and, well, most of the rest of the ecosystem which exists because they operate an “invasion of privacy as a service” business. basically, i think stating privacy is your mission is still supportable, even if you have bugs. but attempting to ignore that you host the data platforms that thrive on it is a tasty bit of prestidigitation. but that might be a little too verbose as a tagline."
"facebook and google were far from the only developers openly abusing apple’s enterprise certificate program meant for companies offering employee-only apps. a techcrunch investigation uncovered a dozen hardcore pornography apps and a dozen real-money gambling apps that escaped apple’s oversight. the developers passed apple’s weak enterprise certificate screening process or piggybacked on a legitimate approval, allowing them to sidestep the app store and cupertino’s traditional safeguards designed to keep ios family-friendly. without proper oversight, they were able to operate these vice apps that blatantly flaunt apple’s content policies. the situation shows further evidence that apple has been neglecting its responsibility to police the enterprise certificate program, leading to its exploitation to circumvent app store rules and forbidden categories. for a company whose ceo tim cook frequently criticizes its competitors for data misuse and policy fiascos like facebook’s cambridge analytica, apple’s failure to catch and block these porn and gambling apps demonstrates it has work to do itself. porn apps ppav and iporn (ip) continue to abuse apple’s enterprise certificate program to sidestep the app store’s ban on pornography. nudity censored by techcrunch   techcrunch broke the news last week that facebook and google had broken the rules of apple’s enterprise certificate program to distribute apps that installed vpns or demanded root network access to collect all of a user’s traffic and phone activity for competitive intelligence. that led apple to briefly revoke facebook and google’s certificates, thereby disabling the companies’ legitimate employee-only apps, which caused office chaos. apple issued a fiery statement that “facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with apple. any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” meanwhile, dozens of prohibited apps were available for download from shady developers’ websites. apple offers a lookup tool for finding any business’ d-u-n-s number, allowing shady developers to forge their enterprise certificate application the problem starts with apple’s lax standards for accepting businesses to the enterprise program. the program is for companies to distribute apps only to their employees, and its policy explicitly states “you may not use, distribute or otherwise make your internal use applications available to your customers.” yet apple doesn’t adequately enforce these policies. developers simply have to fill out an online form and pay $299 to apple, as detailed in this guide from calvium. the form merely asks developers to pledge they’re building an enterprise certificate app for internal employee-only use, that they have the legal authority to register the business, provide a d-u-n-s business id number and have an up to date mac. you can easily google a business’ address details and look up their d-u-n-s id number with a tool apple provides. after setting up an apple id and agreeing to its terms of service, businesses wait one to four weeks for a phone call from apple asking them to reconfirm they’ll only distribute apps internally and are authorized to represent their business. with just a few lies on the phone and web plus some googleable public information, sketchy developers can get approved for an apple enterprise certificate. real-money gambling apps openly advertise that they have ios versions available that abuse the enterprise certificate program given the number of policy-violating apps that are being distributed to non-employees using registrations for businesses unrelated to their apps, it’s clear that apple needs to tighten the oversight on the enterprise certificate program. techcrunch found thousands of sites offering downloads of “sideloaded” enterprise apps, and investigating just a sample uncovered numerous abuses. using a standard un-jailbroken iphone, techcrunch was able to download and verify 12 pornography and 12 real-money gambling apps over the past week that were abusing apple’s enterprise certificate system to offer apps prohibited from the app store. these apps either offered streaming or pay-per-view hardcore pornography, or allowed users to deposit, win and withdraw real money — all of which would be prohibited if the apps were distributed through the app store. a whole screen of prohibited sideloaded porn and gambling apps techcrunch was able to download through the enterprise certificate system in an apparent effort to step up policy enforcement in the wake of techcrunch’s investigation into facebook and google’s enterprise certificate violations, apple appears to have disabled some of these apps in the past few days, but many remain operational. the porn apps that we discovered which are currently functional include swag, ppav, banana video, iporn (ip), pear, poshow and avbobo, while the currently functional gambling apps include rd poker and riverpoker. the enterprise certificates for these apps were rarely registered to company names related to their true purpose. the only example was lucky8 for gambling. many of the apps used innocuous names like interprener, mohajer international communications, sungate and asianlivetech. yet others seemed to have forged or stolen credentials to sign up under the names of completely unrelated but legitimate businesses. dragon gaming was registered to u.s. gravel supplier csl-loma. as for porn apps, ppav’s certificate is assigned to the nanjing jianye district information center, douyin didi was licensed under moscow motorcycle company akura ooo, chinese app pear is registered to grupo arcavi sociedad anonima in costa rica and avbobo covers its tracks with the name of a fresno-based company called chaney cabinet & furniture co. you can see a full list of the policy-violating apps we found: apple refused to explain how these apps slipped into the enterprise certificate app program. it declined to say if it does any follow-up compliance audits on developers in the program or if it plans to change the admission process. an apple spokesperson did provide this statement, though, indicating it will work to shut down these apps and potentially ban the developers from building ios products entirely: “developers that abuse our enterprise certificates are in violation of the apple developer enterprise program agreement and will have their certificates terminated, and if appropriate, they will be removed from our developer program completely. we are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action.” techcrunch asked guardian mobile firewall’s security expert will strafach to look at the apps we found and their certificates. strafach’s initial analysis of the apps didn’t find any glaring evidence that the apps misappropriate data, but they all do violate apple’s certificate policies and provide content banned from the app store. “at the moment, i have noticed that action is slower regarding apps available from an independent website and not these easy-to-scrape app directories” that occasionally crop up offering centralized access to a plethora of sideloaded apps. porn app avbobo uses an enterprise certificate registered to fresno’s chaney cabinet & furniture co strafach explained how “a significant number of the enterprise certificates used to sign publicly available apps are referred to informally as ‘rogue certificates’ as they are often not associated with the named company. there are no hard facts to confirm the manner in which these certificates originate, but the result of the initial step is that individuals will gain control of an enterprise certificate attributable to a corporation, usually china/hk-based. code services are then sold quietly on chinese language marketplaces, resulting in sometimes 5 to 10 (or more) distinct apps being signed with the same enterprise certificate.” we found sungate and mohajer certificates were farmed out for use by multiple apps in this way. “in my experience, enterprise certificate signed apps available on independent websites have not been harmful to users in a malicious sense, only in the sense that they have broken the rules,” strafach notes. “enterprise certificate signed apps from these chinese ‘helper’ tools, however, have been a mixed bag. for example, in multiple cases, we have noticed such apps with additional tracking and adware code injected into the original now-repackaged app being offered.” porn apps like swag openly advertise their availability on ios interestingly, none of the off-limits apps we discovered asked users to install a vpn like google screenwise, let alone root network access like facebook research. techcrunch reported this month that both apps had been paying users to snoop on their private data. but the ios versions were banned by apple after we exposed their policy violations, and apple also caused chaos at facebook and google’s offices by temporarily shutting down their employee-only ios apps too. the fact that these two u.s. tech giants were more aggressive about collecting user data than shady chinese porn and gambling apps is telling. “this is a cat-and-mouse game,” strafach concluded regarding apple’s struggle to keep out these apps. but given the rampant abuse, it seems apple could easily add stronger verification processes and more check-ups to the enterprise certificate program. developers should have to do more to prove their apps’ connection with the certificate holder, and apple should regularly audit certificates to see what kind of apps they’re powering. back when facebook missed cambridge analytica’s abuse of its app

"update: success! all payloads deployed successfully. now we just have to wait on that moon landing… calling all lunatics — the first fully private moon landing mission is about to take off from cape canaveral. a spacex falcon 9 rocket carrying spaceil’s beresheet lander is set to take off about an hour from now, at 5:45 pacific time. watch it right here! the launch isn’t just the lander — in fact, the lander is only a small part of the payload. the primary passenger is nusantara satu, an indian communications satellite that will provide connectivity to rural areas in the country difficult to reach by ordinary means. once it gets to its geosynchronous orbit it will deploy the u.s. air force research lab’s s5 experimental satellite, which will track objects and debris around that altitude. but by the time those deploy (about 44 minutes after launch), beresheet will be well on its way; it’s entering a transfer orbit with an eye to lunar insertion and touchdown on the surface there in april. historic first private mission to the moon launches thursday night should it accomplish its task, the israeli satellite will be the first private mission to land on the moon. so far it’s just been us, russia and china — others have passed by or orbited, to be sure, but no one has made a soft landing and taken pictures, as beresheet intends to do. it was originally planned to do this for google’s ill-fated lunar xprize, which went unclaimed despite serious interest — the truth is it was just a bit too ambitious for its own good. but several of the companies and teams that entered are still going strong, moving forward at their own paces. at around $100 million, beresheet will be the cheapest moon landing mission by far, and as the first to do so on a privately engineered and built (not to mention previously flown) rocket, as a secondary payload and with a private launch coordinator… let’s just say that it’s likely to set records all over the place if all goes well. the first thing that needs to happen, of course, is takeoff. so tune in below at 5:45:"
"sapling, a three-year-old, san francisco-based company whose employee management and onboarding software is being adopted by a small but growing number of mid-size companies with far-flung workforces, is announcing today that it has raised $4 million in funding from gradient ventures, which is google’s ai fund, and tuesday capital, formerly known as crunchfund. it quietly secured the funding several months ago and has been using it to ramp up to the 50 people it currently employs. the company’s founding team is the kind that investors like to see, meaning that in many ways, their previous work experiences led them to start sapling . co-founder and ceo bart macdonald has spent his entire career in hr, working most recently in melbourne, australia, as a regional director for the global coding school general assembly, where he hired and managed a 10-person marketing, sales and operations team. meanwhile, co-founder andy crebar (born in the same sydney hospital as macdonald, a day later) also knows the plight of individuals trying to seamlessly onboard new hires, having worked most recently on business development initiatives at a fintech startup called credible labs, where adding headcount was, as at many companies, a point of frustration. “i liked that bart and andy had lived through their own experiences dealing with crappy hr software in previous positions and thus really understood how customers view the problem,” says tuesday capital co-founder pat gallagher. “the fact that neither are technical would have been an issue if we were investing pre product, but by the time we invested, they had proven they could build software that their customers loved.” in fact, says gallagher, his team was drawn to sapling specifically because a handful of the firm’s portfolio companies has been using its onboarding software and “really raving about it. it’s hard to find hr software that people really like, so that was a big positive for us and helped cut through the noise of the space that they operate in.” so what’s so special about sapling? mostly, it seems, its approach brings together the tools and software that hr execs are already using, including adp for payroll, or g suite for productivity, and lever for recruiting, integrations that also employ a heavy dose of ai to anticipate the behaviors of employees, making it easier for managers to recruit, aid, manage and support current and future staffers. as macdonald explains it on the simplest level, sapling not only provisions software for them but it connects their tools “so they don’t have to open 10 tabs. all they have to do is run their workflow inside of sapling so that, for example, an employee can ask for time off in slack,” and that request will automatically be reflected in the employer’s payroll and benefits systems (once approved). sapling currently works with companies with anywhere from 100 to 1,500 employees, including invision, an eight-year-old commercial platform used by design teams to create digital products for mobile and desktop that is currently investing its series f round. invision, which has a large distributed workforce, says sapling has saved the company 1,000 hours by speeding up communications and making employee engagement far more seamless. what comes next for sapling remains to be seen. it’s in an awfully crowded category, with no shortage of all-in-one hr solutions attracting venture capital. in the meantime, with low unemployment creating headaches for many outfits looking to keep its talent, sapling is smartly positioning itself as an important tool in specifically helping companies with geographically distributed teams to retain and engage employees. customers like invision, along with digital ocean, kpmg and kayak, say it’s working, too. above, left to right: founders bart macdonald and andy crebar, courtesy of sapling."
"google today announced an expansion of its educational initiatives with the chromebook app hub from google for education, due to launch later in 2019. the new resource is designed to offer teachers and other curriculum administrators an easier, more centralized means of finding the appropriate educational tools and apps they can use in the classroom. teachers often surf the web to find ideas and activities to help them with their lesson plans, while the school’s it and other curriculum specialists regularly field app requests from teachers, but have to ensure the programs the teachers want to use are allowed by the district’s policies, explains google. meanwhile, the companies that build edtech applications want to be able to reach teachers and educators to tell them about their software solutions. that’s where the chromebook app hub would come in. but unlike a traditional app marketplace that offers only a searchable list of apps to try, the app hub aims to show in a more concrete fashion how the apps can be used in the classroom. google says it worked with the edtechteam and other educators to author what it’s calling “idea sparks” — which are examples of how apps can be used, along with tips, differentiated instruction strategies and links to more resources that can help, like videos, activities and useful websites. the idea here is to provide more than a set of apps to choose from, but to offer a complete set of tools and information needed to actually put the apps to work in the classroom by allowing educators to learn from one another. “in my experience, teachers learn about applications in two ways: learning about a new lesson idea that has the app integrated into it, or hearing about an app that sounds awesome and want to get ideas about how to use it,” explained kate petty, the director of educational learning at edtechteam, in an announcement. “idea sparks give teachers an opportunity to learn about new idea sparks and, even better, will provide an opportunity for teachers to share what they have created,” she said. google also worked with the nonprofit student data privacy consortium (sdpc) to help app developers better consider the data privacy aspects of their products. this way, districts can search the app hub for those solutions that match up with their own data privacy requirements. the app hub can also be searched and filtered by the idea category, subject, age range and learning goal. the launch of app hub, which is expected for later in the year, follows a series of moves by google that focus on bringing to the classroom its chromebook platform, tools and services — whether that’s upgraded devices designed for classroom use, or its browser-based software for teachers, like classroom, forms and quizzes, as well as g suite for education. google said at the beginning of the year it now has 80 million educators and students using g suite for education, 40 million students and teachers on google classroom and 30 million more using google chromebooks both inside and outside the classroom."

"among mobile ad networks, facebook and google remain the best bet for advertisers, according to the latest roi index from marketing startup singular. to pull together this year’s index, singular says it sampled $1.5 billion in ad spending (from the $10 billion in spending that the company optimizes annually) and measured which networks are delivering the best return on investment. it also kept an eye out for ad fraud, apparently deleting a record 15 companies from the rankings because of “excessive” fraud. so yes, facebook followed by google topped the list. as the report puts it, “savvy marketers know they need more than just two media partners, but google and facebook are in virtually every mobile marketer’s game plan for good reason: they deliver.” at the same time, singular noted that snap improved its rankings on virtually all the lists, and is now the no. 3 network for non-gaming ads on both ios and android. and twitter did respectably as well, ranking second on ios for retention. comparing the two big mobile platforms, it seems that android is more volatile — one-third of the networks on the android roi list are appearing for the first time, and 80 percent of the remaining 10 networks changed position on the list. on ios, on the other hand, 73 percent of the networks changed positions, but there were only two new ones on the list. you can download the full index here. marketing data startup singular raises $30m"
"in the first days of 2017, osterhout design group arrived at ces with a two-story booth and huge promises. the startup’s founder, ralph osterhout, wanted to take the small san francisco-based company even further past its military contractor roots in ar, building out major enterprise and consumer businesses with flashy new product lines. the company had just raised $58 million, and the las vegas electronics show served as its launchpad for its r-8 and r-9 augmented reality glasses lines that osterhout hoped would bring “glasses to the masses.” less than a year later, however, the company had burned through its funding and couldn’t pay employees. by early 2018, odg had lost half of its workforce as it sought loans to pay back employees. today, a skeleton crew awaits a patent sale less than a week away after acquisitions from several large tech companies, including facebook and magic leap, fell through, multiple sources tell techcrunch. odg founder and ceo ralph osterhout ralph osterhout, 73, founded odg 20 years ago as a high-tech toy company, built after his previous venture, machina, collapsed in what a wired report at the time called “a spectacular bankruptcy.” after underwriting odg with $14,000 of his own cash, osterhout kept the startup plugging along on its own merits before he decided that it was time to reach for outside funding to turn his company into a powerhouse in the burgeoning augmented reality industry. at the end of 2016, the company raised a $58 million round led by 21st century fox. odg was already getting thousands of orders for its r-7 glasses, an enterprise-focused product that it billed as a head-worn android tablet that could help workers go through checklists, review documents and share live video feeds hands-free. osterhout wanted to get ar glasses into the hands of consumers and take advantage of new tech advances, even as magic leap was teasing the release of its own heavily hyped consumer product. “i hope magic leap is a huge success. i want everyone in ar to be a huge success,” osterhout said in an interview with techcrunch in 2017. “[augmented reality] is going to be transformative.” months later, a large chinese firm approached odg with an offer north of the company’s $258 million series a valuation, a source tells techcrunch. talks fell through, but odg’s leadership was at their most ambitious and felt like they couldn’t be stopped. at the same time, following the ces 2017 product unveil, some employees wondered whether having three distinct product lines under development aimed at roughly the same customer was the right direction for the company with around 100 employees. ralph osterhout’s strong internal popularity kept these concerns at bay even as the company faced double-digit return rates from customers of its current-generation r-7 glasses due to manufacturing issues. “that’s a little bit the story of odg and ralph, in general: everything is a prototype, nothing is finished, and before one thing is 60 percent done, you’re already onto the next one,” a former employee tells techcrunch. “i think the heart of odg’s downfall was its lack of focus.” odg unveils its first consumer ar/vr glasses, built on qualcomm’s snapdragon 835 chip the company never ended up shipping the r-9 or the r-8 or even fulfilling all of its r-7 orders. it blew through its funding before the fall of 2017, and it wasn’t long before employees were on half-pay and soon stopped getting paid at all. odg sought backing from chinese firms, but sources say that a negative trade environment hampered those efforts. in 2018, it received an $8 million loan from a chinese firm used to pay back employees as osterhout began trying to scrounge together an exit strategy, seeking buyers for the company that bore his name. suitors for the company included magic leap, facebook, razer and lenovo, sources tell techcrunch. in each case talks fell through, as osterhout was convinced that his company was being undervalued by the prospective acquirers. odg’s san francisco offices in 2016 sources say that magic leap continued to bump up its offer, eventually signing a letter of intent in the final months of 2018 to purchase the startup. the final proposed purchase price ended up at $35 million, still a far cry from its 2016 valuation, a source familiar with the deal tells techcrunch. this offer came with stipulations for the types of engineers magic leap wanted to bring aboard, leading odg to shrink its staff to just a couple dozen employees. as the startup whittled itself down to prepare for a disappointing, yet relatively dignified, sign-off, magic leap began to grow cagey about finalizing the acquisition, sources say. as the deal started to fall through, some in odg’s leadership began to wonder aloud whether magic leap was “acting in poor faith” and was only looking to starve the company before purchasing assets at a discount in a patent sale. “ralph turned around and he didn’t have a company or team anymore, and then magic leap goes, you know what, we’re just going to buy the ip, we don’t want the company, you don’t have a company anymore,” one source said. magic leap did not respond to a request for comment. with the deal shot and the indebted company in shambles, the team dwindled down further to a skeleton crew — essentially a deals team — as company assets were put up for sale by ip advisory firm hilco streambank. the company’s patent portfolio up for sale next week includes 107 issued patents and 83 pending applications. the 20-year-old company has already seen its early work in foundational ar patents pay off. in 2014, microsoft paid around $150 million to acquire a trove of odg patents after deciding not to buy the company outright. in documents reviewed by techcrunch, odg highlights a number of ar patents in its collection on which it believes existing products from companies like magic leap, google and facebook infringe, specifically pointing to diagrams of systems like the magic leap one and oculus quest that they claim conflict with its prior art. with a patent sale (spotted first by uploadvr), odg’s leadership is looking to recoup enough to pay back the company’s debts, as well as the employees who worked for months on partial salaries. microsoft paid up to $150m to buy wearable computing ip from the osterhout design group whether or not odg’s downfall was largely a cause of mismanagement, the disparity between acquisition offers and its 2016 valuation showcases a broader cooldown in the augmented reality industry, as capital-intensive efforts in enterprise and hardware have proven to be a more difficult sell for investors heading into 2019. last month, blippar, an enterprise-focused ar startup that raised more than $130 million, collapsed after failing to secure an emergency influx of cash. just yesterday, it was reported that meta, an ar hardware startup with $73 million in funding from y combinator, tencent and comcast, had fallen into insolvency. magic leap itself has had issues breaking into broader markets: in november the startup lost out to microsoft on a $480 million military contract. asked whether they would pin the company’s failures on the broader industry slowdown, a former employee said, “from an internal standpoint, all i saw was, we are fucking it up.” ralph osterhout did not respond to a request for comment."
"a bug that anyone can easily exploit in google makes it easy to kick out manipulated search results that look entirely real. the search manipulation bug was documented by wietze beukema, a london-based security specialist, who warned that a malicious user could use this bug to generate misinformation. this is done by splicing together values from a google search result’s “knowledge graph,” the cards that pop up in search results to supplement the search query with visuals and quick facts. anything from countries, planets, tech news sites and more have cards that appear on the right-side of google’s search results, displaying other nuggets of information at a glance. in a blog post, beukema explained that the short, shareable url when entered into a google search result could be chopped and added to the web address of any other search query. so, when you’d search: “what is the capital of britain,” you’d expect london to return. actually, you can make it any value — such as mars. it also works if you search “who is the us president?” you can just manipulate the result to read “snoop dogg.” a bug makes it easy to put the contents of a knowledge card into a search result. (image: techcrunch)the manipulated search query doesn’t break https, so anyone can craft a link, send it in an email, tweet it out or share it on facebook — and the recipient, one assumes, would be none the wiser. but that can be a real problem in an age of mistrust of internet companies after misinformation campaigns by nation-state actors. beukema warned that this search manipulation bug could be used to spread factually incorrect information, or even propaganda. “who is responsible for 9/11?” can be pointed to george bush, a widely held conspiracy theory. “where was barack obama born?” can be pointed to kenya, another conspiracy theory largely propagated by his successor, donald trump, who later backtracked on the claim. and even, “which party should i vote for?” can be pointed to either the republicans or the democrats. no wonder so many people think the election was rigged if they think they can click a button and have a search engine tell them who to vote for. beukema told techcrunch that anyone can “generate normal-looking google urls that make controversial assertions,” which can “either look bad on google, or worse, people will accept them as being true.” he said that he first reported the bug to google in december 2017, but the report was closed without the company taking any action. “the ‘attack’ i described relies on this trust people have in google and the facts it presents,” he said. the bug is still active at the time of writing. in fact, it’s been known about for almost three years. beukema simply brought the issue to light after first discovering the issue more than a year ago. but it’s already sparked interest from the hacker community. one developer, lucas miller, took just a few hours to build a python script to automatically generate fake results based on search queries. it’s a mystery why google, despite claims of political bias (though no evidence to say it’s true), has taken so long to fix a basic weakness in its search results that would make the service far more trustworthy. a google spokesperson told techcrunch that it was “working to fix” the issue. cybersecurity 101: how to browse the web securely and privately"
"if a picture is worth a thousand words, how many emails can you replace with a video? as offices fragment into remote teams, work becomes more visual and social media makes us more comfortable on camera, it’s time for collaboration to go beyond text. that’s the idea behind loom, a fast-rising startup that equips enterprises with instant video messaging tools. in a click, you can film yourself or narrate a screenshare to get an idea across in a more vivid, personal way. instead of scheduling a video call, employees can asynchronously discuss projects or give “stand-up” updates without massive disruptions to their workflow. in the 2.5 years since launch, loom has signed up 1.1 million users from 18,000 companies. and that was just as a chrome extension. today loom launches its pc and mac apps that give it a dedicated presence in your digital work space. whether you’re communicating across the room or across the globe, “loom is the next best thing to being there,” co-founder shahed khan tells me. now loom is ready to spin up bigger sales and product teams thanks to an $11 million series a led by kleiner perkins . the firm’s partner ilya fushman, formally dropbox’s head of product and corporate development, will join loom’s board. he’ll shepherd loom through today’s launch of its $10 per month per user pro version that offers hd recording, calls-to-action at the end of videos, clip editing, live annotation drawings and analytics to see who actually watched like they’re supposed to. “we’re ditching the suits and ties and bringing our whole selves to work. we’re emailing and messaging like never before, but though we may be more connected, we’re further apart,” khan tells me. “we want to make it very easy to bring the humanity back in.” loom co-founder shahed khan but back in 2016, loom was just trying to survive. khan had worked at upfront ventures after a stint as a product designer at website builder weebly. he and two close friends, joe thomas and vinay hiremath, started opentest to let app makers get usability feedback from experts via video. but after six months and going through the nfx accelerator, they were running out of bootstrapped money. that’s when they realized it was the video messaging that could be a business as teams sought to keep in touch with members working from home or remotely. together they launched loom in mid-2016, raising a pre-seed and seed round amounting to $4 million. part of its secret sauce is that loom immediately starts uploading bytes of your video while you’re still recording so it’s ready to send the moment you’re finished. that makes sharing your face, voice and screen feel as seamless as firing off a slack message, but with more emotion and nuance. “sales teams use it to close more deals by sending personalized messages to leads. marketing teams use loom to walk through internal presentations and social posts. product teams use loom to capture bugs, stand ups, etc.,” khan explains. loom has grown to a 16-person team that will expand thanks to the new $11 million series a from kleiner, slack, cue founder daniel gross and actor jared leto that brings it to $15 million in funding. they predict the new desktop apps that open loom to a larger market will see it spread from team to team for both internal collaboration and external discussions from focus groups to customer service. loom will have to hope that after becoming popular at a company, managers will pay for the pro version that shows exactly how long each viewer watched. that could clue them in that they need to be more concise, or that someone is cutting corners on training and cooperation. it’s also a great way to onboard new employees. “just watch this collection of videos and let us know what you don’t understand.” at $10 per month though, the same cost as google’s entire gsuite, loom could be priced too high. next loom will have to figure out a mobile strategy — something that’s surprisingly absent. khan imagines users being able to record quick clips from their phones to relay updates from travel and client meetings. loom also plans to build out voice transcription to add automatic subtitles to videos and even divide clips into thematic sections you can fast-forward between. loom will have to stay ahead of competitors like vidyard’s govideo and wistia’s soapbox that have cropped up since its launch. but khan says loom looms largest in the space thanks to customers at uber, dropbox, airbnb, red bull and 1,100 employees at hubspot. “the overall space of collaboration tools is becoming deeper than just email + docs,” says fushman, citing slack, zoom, dropbox paper, coda, notion, intercom, productboard and figma. to get things done the fastest, businesses are cobbling together b2b software so they can skip building it in-house and focus on their own product. no piece of enterprise software has to solve everything. but loom is dependent on apps like slack, google docs, convo and asana. because it lacks a social or identity layer, you’ll need to send the links to your videos through another service. loom should really build its own video messaging system into its desktop app. but at least slack is an investor, and khan says “they’re trying to be the hub of text-based communication,” and the soon-to-be-public unicorn tells him anything it does in video will focus on real-time interaction. still, the biggest threat to loom is apathy. people already feel overwhelmed with slack and email, and if recording videos comes off as more of a chore than an efficiency, workers will stick to text. and without the skimability of an email, you can imagine a big queue of videos piling up that staffers don’t want to watch. but khan thinks the ubiquity of instagram stories is making it seem natural to jump on camera briefly. and the advantage is that you don’t need a bunch of time-wasting pleasantries to ensure no one misinterprets your message as

"china’s xiaomi has become the latest smartphone maker to tease a folding smartphone, dropping the below video clip of its president and co-founder, bin lin, fondling the device on social media today. the twist is the tablet does not have a single center parting but rather two folds that divide it into three panels, with xiaomi claiming in a tweet: “it is the world’s first ever double folding phone.” the video shows bin contemplating a tablet-sized touchscreen device before quickly turning it on its side, taking it into landscape orientation, where he performs the party trick — folding two panels of screen, one at each side, back behind the tablet to form a slightly chunky looking phablet. excited to share this video of a special xiaomi smartphone from our president and co-founder bin lin . it is the world’s first ever double folding phone — that’s pretty cool, isn’t it? #xiaomi #foldingphone #technology pic.twitter.com/ibj0n3vibw — wang xiang (@xiangw_) january 23, 2019 the video is edited so it cuts from front view to back at the moment of the fold so the actual folding action is not seen from the front. but from the back the two folded wings go dark after being folded. when the video cuts back to the front there’s a slight spinning of the screen, as the software appears to grapple momentarily with the new form factor, before it stablizes in portrait orientation. the phablet form of the device resembles the bezel-less “infinity display” design of a handset like the 2018 samsung galaxy s8 — albeit more squat looking than the tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio of the s8. xiaomi’s tweet teaser does not include any details about how near (or indeed far off) a market launch of the device might be. we’ve reached out to the company with questions about the prototype and any launch plans. update: a spokesman pointed us to a post on bin’s weibo account where he asks his followers for feedback on the prototype, and suggests xiaomi is still weighing up whether to bring the folding phone to market, writing: “if you like it, we will consider making a mass production machine in the future.” he also asks for name suggestions, saying xiaomi is toying with two: xiaomi dual flex or xiaomi mix flex. “this symmetrical double-folded form perfectly combines the experience of the tablet and mobile phone, which is both practical and beautiful,” he writes [translated via google translate], saying building the prototype entailed “conquering a series of technical problems such as flexible folding screen technology, four-wheel drive folding shaft technology, flexible cover technology, and miui adaptation.” “we made the first folding screen mobile phone, which should be the world’s first double folding mobile phone,” he adds, again taking a tentative tone vis-à-vis a potential launch time frame. in recent months a handful of folding smartphone prototypes have been demoed by mobile makers, including a booklet-style folding slab from samsung — trailed as incoming for years but finally teased officially last fall — which also appears to transforms into a rather chunky handset. an invite to a february 20 samsung launch event for the forthcoming galaxy s10, sent out to press two weeks ago, also included a conspicuous centerfold in its graphic teaser. ergo, a commercial launch from samsung looks imminent. while, at ces, a little known chinese oem called royole beat others to the punch by showing off a folder in the flesh. in tablet form the android-powered flexpai, as the device was christened, is 7.8-inches. but once folded in half the gizmo is left with an unsightly gap between the screen pieces, bulking up the resulting smartphone.   xiaomi’s triptych looks to offer a more pleasing design for handling the inevitable air gap created by a folding screen by concealing the ends in the middle of the dual folded panels. side tucks certainly look more visually pleasing. that said, two folds could mean a higher risk of screen problems — if the folding mechanism isn’t robust enough to handle lots of bending back and forth. it’s also far from clear whether consumers will generally take to folding phones, or snub them as fiddly and gimmicky. in recent years smartphone design has converged around a phablet-sized touchscreen and little else. so adding any fresh mechanical complication is a bit of a risk given how smooth and hermetically sealed smartphones have otherwise become. but a clutch of android oems are going to try their luck, regardless. and with a saturated smartphone market, stalled growth and competition fiercer than ever, you can see why they’re pushing the boat out — or, well, bending the screen back — to try to stand out."
"ben schippers contributor ben schippers is a co-founder of happyfuncorp. more posts by this contributor a modest proposal to make apps suck less tesla, a great family brand as the landscape for designing and building technology continues to evolve, so should the process for designing such systems. whether it’s for investing or helping to build a product, it’s important to convey a need for the entrepreneur or company to consider the long term impact of their product and to consider a more mindful and deliberate approach. product processes should always go in this order: strategy first, then design and lastly, engineering.  if you approach each process pillar with “why?” you will end up with a better product, a more engaged consumer and maybe even a valuable contribution to our ever bloated internet. phase 1, product strategy: within the product strategy pillar, it’s important to remember that just because someone can build a product, doesn’t mean they should.  just because a type of technology is available, doesn’t mean it will improve an experience.  purpose drives products, never technology for its own sake. recently at the 40th international conference of data protection, giovanni buttarelli, the conference host stated, “not everything that is legally compliant and technically feasible is morally sustainable.”  in other words, “should i build it?” is a question to always be asked during this phase. a clue to truly understanding this phase is to ask “how different is my idea before starting this phase vs. after?” the more an idea has evolved, the better. phase 2, product design: if designers keep bouncing between phase 1 and 2, that’s a good sign.  remember, ideas that die in phase 1 should be viewed as wins no matter how much work or time has been put in. while transitioning to the product design phase, it’s critical to remember: the consumer is tired … really tired. assume that most conventions simply don’t resonate with the consumer anymore; consider it a widespread technology burnout — app fatigue.  a perfect example of this is with notifications or similar mindless alerts. do notifications make the experience better?  do notifications make users want to use the software or the app?  if it’s a question that’s being asked, then the answer is a resounding, no.  go back to the strategy phase – rinse and repeat. the questions to ask are quite simply, “what will make a user want to come back to this product without notifications or similar tchotchkes?” what experience is created that’s going to resonate with the customer? if an overall user experience resonates with the end user, they will willingly come back without notifications.  this may seem obvious or simple, but the obvious answers are typically the hardest to answer and often ignored for that reason. consider for a moment what uber did for hailing a cab, or airbnb for vacation rentals.  these companies are using a technology to enable a product experience that truly provides a meaningful and rich opportunity for the consumer. they didn’t need notifications to drive consumers back – they provide a service that consumers didn’t know they needed.  it was an original, differentiated idea. the question is does any new leap that hurdle? if developers make it through the strategy phase and understand the core features to be designed, it’s a good idea to focus on new engineering solutions that can help provide safer, more mindful experiences related to engineering architecture and user data. engineering: currently, whether inside, facebook, google or amazon, most user data is stored inside centralized servers. this creates security and privacy concerns. how could developers create a more mindful approach to user data without storing it inside one of only a few major technology companies?  an architecture connecting people on a product via a follow, friending or another, similar, mechanism should have that data be encrypted and stored on the networked phones, versus a centralized server.  in short, passing the user-data baton to your friend(s) instead of a company. while still in its infancy, the proposed architecture would pair well with an overall product experience that is focused on the future generation of apps.  it would create a decentralized architecture that plays in the favor of the consumer instead of the company. it’s another example of a mindful ‘user-first approach’.  a large leap for startups, it’s a good example of thinking about new approaches and constantly challenging the norm, in this case, user data and security. pulling it all together: consider the following case study as a blueprint:  imagine proposing to build an inherently social application.  (this example is illustrative because many young entrepreneurs still have social at their core, and many businesses believe social is still a key first differentiator.) for this example answer: ‘why are you hoping to build such software?” followed by “do you feel this will help people or society in any positive or productive way?” (other than trying to get their attention?) those targeted questions focus the importance of what software has become and its larger impact on society. from there, try to shift the focus from higher level strategy — what are you building and why — to specific features: the design phase.  typically, there’s a friend or follow connection model; a way for people to see activity and some level of bothersome notifications, prompts, or updates. then focus on providing mindful alternative solutions to these standard features.  consider limiting the number of friend requests to help illuminate the product offering?  or if the product is a bit further down the road: consider putting up a paywall tier for potential customers not wanting to see ads.  or: consider not having an algorithm sort content and instead, show content as it comes in or give the consumer the option? companies are beginning to explore these types of alternatives. consider what apple has done for map sharing in their recent ios release and google is following suit. less is more in the current and future world of software design and development. and mindful, deliberate decisions will provide the underpinning of the next generation of apps and larger software ecosystems. providing value in a congested market is very challenging.  but incorporating a mindful approach to product design enables a streamlined architecture that saves time and provides a framework to building products people actually want to use."
"uber is in negotiations with investors, including the softbank vision fund, to secure an investment as large as $1 billion for its autonomous vehicles unit. the deal would value the business at between $5 billion and $10 billion, according to a tuesday report from the wall street journal. uber declined to comment. the news comes shortly after techcrunch’s mark harris revealed the ridehailing firm was burning through $20 million a month on developing self-driving technologies, which means, according to our calculations, that uber could have spent more than $900 million on automated vehicle research since early 2015. according to the wsj, the deal could close as soon as next month, shortly before uber is expected to complete a highly-anticipated initial public offering. uber, in december, filed the necessary paperwork with the us securities and exchange commission to go public in 2019. the documents were submitted only hours after its competitor lyft did the same; lyft, for its part, unveiled its s-1 earlier this month and will debut on the nasdaq shortly. uber, to date, has raised nearly $20 billion in a combination of debt and equity funding, reaching a valuation north of $70 billion. the business is said to be seeking funding for its self-driving business in order to tout the unit’s growth and valuation. after all, a $10 billion sticker price on its av efforts may bandage its reputation, damaged by continued reports questioning its progress. alphabet-owned waymo, meanwhile, is reportedly looking to raise capital, too. this would be the first infusion of outside funding for the autonomous vehicle business, rolled out of alphabet’s google x. according to the information, which broke this news on monday, waymo would raise capital at a valuation “several times” that of cruise, the av company owned by general motors. raising capital from outside investors would help limit costs and would allow alphabet the opportunity to display waymo’s valuation for the first time in several years. alphabet, however, does not want to relinquish too much equity in the business, justifiably. waymo, years ago, was valued at $4.5 billion, though analysts claim it could surpass a valuation as high as $175 billion based on future revenue estimates. waymo didn’t respond to a request for comment. other investors in uber’s purported round include an “unnamed automaker,” per the wsj. uber’s existing backers include toyota, softbank, t. rowe price, fidelity and tpg growth. uber’s net losses were up 32 percent quarter-over-quarter as of late last year to $939 million on a pro forma basis. on an ebitda basis, uber’s losses were $527 million, up about 21 percent. the company said revenue was up five percent qoq sitting at $2.95 billion and up 38 percent year-over-year. report: google’s waymo seeks outside investment and a sky-high valuation"
"facebook has changed its story after initially trying to downplay how it targeted teens with its research program that a techcrunch investigation revealed was paying them gift cards to monitor all their mobile app usage and browser traffic. “less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens” a facebook spokesperson told techcrunch and many other news outlets in a damage control effort 7 hours after we published our report on january 29th. at the time,  facebook claimed that it had removed its research app from ios. the next morning we learned that wasn’t true, as apple had already forcibly blocked the facebook research app for violating its enterprise certificate program that supposed to reserved for companies distributing internal apps to employees. it turns out that wasn’t the only time facebook deceived the public in its response regarding the research vpn scandal. techcrunch has obtained facebook’s unpublished february 21st response to questions about the research program in a letter from senator mark warner, who wrote to ceo mark zuckerberg that “facebook’s apparent lack of full transparency with users – particularly in the context of ‘research’ efforts – has been a source of frustration for me.” in the response from facebook’s vp of us public policy kevin martin, the company admits that (emphasis ours) “at the time we ended the facebook research app on apple’s ios platform, less than 5 percent of the people sharing data with us through this program were teens. analysis shows that number is about 18 percent when you look at the complete lifetime of the program, and also add people who had become inactive and uninstalled the app.” so 18 percent of research testers were teens. it was only less than 5 percent when facebook got caught. given users age 13 to 35 were eligible for facebook’s research program, 13 to 18 year olds made of 22 percent of the age range. that means facebook clearly wasn’t trying to minimize teen involvement, nor were they just a tiny fraction of users. washington, dc – april 10: facebook co-founder, chairman and ceo mark zuckerberg testifies before a combined senate judiciary and commerce committee hearing in the hart senate office building on capitol hill april 10, 2018 in washington, dc. (photo by chip somodevilla/getty images) warner asked facebook “do you think any use reasonable understood facebook was using this data for commercial purposes includingto track competitors?” facebook response indicates it never told research users anything about tracking “competitors”, and instead dances around the question. facebook says the registration process told users the data would help the company “understand how people use mobile apps,” “improve . . . services,” and “introduce new features for millions of people around the world.” facebook had also told reporters on january 29th regarding teens’ participation, “all of them with signed parental consent forms.” yet in its response to senator warner, facebook admitted that “potential participants were required to confirm that they were over 18 or provide other evidence of parental consent, though the vendors did not require a signed parental consent form for teen users.” in some cases, underage users merely had to check a box to claim they had parental consent, and there was no verification of users’ ages or that their parents actually approved. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them so to quickly recap: techcrunch reports on january 29th that facebook is paying teens and adults up to $20 in gift cards per month to install a research vpn with root network access to spy on all their mobile app activity, web browsing, and even encrypted communications. techcrunch informs facebook and apple that facebook’s research app violates apple’s enterprise certificate rules. that night, facebook claims it shut down the research app on ios but didn’t violate apple’s policy, and tells reporters only 5 percent of research users were teens and they all had signed parental consent forms. the next morning, apple tells techcrunch that it forcibly shut down facebook research on ios for violating the enterprise certificate rules, and invalidates facebook’s certificate thereby breaking its internal ios apps for 30 hours, including its workplace chat and task management apps as well as its shuttle schedule and lunch menu techcrunch reports google’s screenwise meter market research app was also breaking apple’s enterprise certificate rules, but it quickly apologies and shuts down the app on ios though it still has its internal ios apps invalidated for 6 hours. senator warner issues a letter demanding answers about facebook research from mark zuckerberg, while senators blumenthal and markey also issue sternly worded reprimands of facebook. facebook’s vp of production engineering and security pedro canahuati publishes an internal memo disputing our reporting by saying the program was never secret, but its points are swiftly dismantled by techcrunch after we reveal that legal action was threatened if a research user spoke publicly about the app. techcrunch reports that apple failed to block dozens of hardcore pornography and real-money gambling apps abusing enterprise certificate program to sidestep the app store’s rules, and apple shuts them down. facebook tells techcrunch on february 21st that it’s ceased recruiting users for its research program on android where it was still running, and  that it will shut down its similar onavo market research spyware vpn on android after apple banned it last year. that same day, facebook issues this response to senator warner that shows its initial response to reporters wasn’t accurate. facebook targeted teens with ads on instagram and snapchat to join the research program without revealing its involvement the contradictions between facebook’s initial response to reporters and what it told warner, who has the power to pursue regulation of the the tech giant, shows facebook willingness to move fast and play loose with the truth when it’s less accountable. it’s no wonder the company never shared the response with techcrunch or posted a blog post or press release about it. facebook’s attempt to minimize the issue in the wake of backlash exemplifies the trend of of the social network’s “reactionary” pr strategy that employees described to buzzfeed’s ryan mac. the company often views its scandals as communications errors rather than actual product screwups or as signals of deep-seeded problems with facebook’s respect for privacy. facebook needs to learn to take its lumps, change course, and do better rather than constantly trying to challenge details of negative press about it, especially before it has all the necessary information. until then, the never-ending news cycle of facebook’s self-made disasters will continue. below is facebook’s full response to senator warner’s inquiry, and following that is warner’s original letter to mark zuckerberg. ﻿ view this document on scribd additional reporting by krystal hu"
"a bit over a year after its release, nest’s security alarm system is picking up a new trick: it can now double as a google assistant device. nest announced the new functionality this afternoon, saying that it’s being “pushed out to all nest secure systems both new and old” today. this update effectively turns the nest secure’s keypad hub into a google home mini, allowing you to do things like say “hey google, turn off the lights” or “hey google, arm the alarm” on the way out the door. it’s worth noting, though, that you can’t turn the alarm off with your voice — they don’t want people shouting through your door to disable your alarm, after all. to turn the alarm off, you’ll still need to use either the nest app, one of nest’s key fobs or punch your pin into the hub. wondering how the heck the nest secure hears you? the current spec page for the nest secure’s control hub (or “nest guard” as the hub is known), for example, makes no mention of a microphone. i can’t find any mention of it in the manual, either. and yet… we included a microphone in the nest guard with features such as the google assistant in mind.it has not been used up to this point, and you can enable or disable it at any time using the nest app. — nest (@nest) february 4, 2019 turns out the nest guard has had a microphone all along, though it “has not been used up to this point.” that’s… a little strange, to say the least. it’s nice to be able to flip on new features when the time comes, but the spec page probably should’ve mentioned the microphone from the beginning (even just to say “there’s a microphone in there, but it’s not used for anything right now.”) there’s no shortage of internet-connected devices with microphones built-in, but said mics are usually made a bit more obvious. we reached out to google for confirmation of the microphone hardware and more details on when the feature will go live. a google spokesperson responded: the google assistant on nest guard is an opt-in feature, and as the feature becomes available to our users, they’ll receive an email with instructions on how to enable the feature and turn on the microphone in the nest app. nest guard does have one on-device microphone that is not enabled by default."
"facebook’s gang that couldn’t shoot straight advertising department has made another blunder, this time by pulling elizabeth warren campaign ads touting the senator’s proposal to break up big tech. the offending ads were pulled, according to politico, over their use of the facebook brand in their copy. meanwhile, other ads that the senator’s presidential campaign had run which addressed the plan to unwind various acquisitions by facebook, amazon and alphabet (the parent company of google) were not removed from facebook. indeed, the removal appears to be short-lived, but has given the warren campaign ammunition for their argument and numerous headlines, tweets and retweets. curious why i think fb has too much power? let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether fb has too much power. thanks for restoring my posts. but i want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor. #breakupbigtech https://t.co/ups6dozoxn — elizabeth warren (@ewarren) march 11, 2019 “we removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo,” a facebook spokesperson told buzzfeed’s ryan mac. “in the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.” facebook confirms it took down elizabeth warren's ads about facebook, but is in the process of restoring them. fb spox: ""we removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo. in the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.” — ryan mac (@rmac18) march 11, 2019 that’s a good move for the facebook public relations team, especially since the ads reportedly didn’t include facebook’s logo. but the damage has already been done. it provides fodder to warren’s argument that big tech has too much power and control over the way information is disseminated — especially on its own platforms. this incident may be a tempest in a teapot, but it will calcify positions on the left and the right about the self-interest of big technology and these companies’ ability to regulate content on their own platforms to the detriment of free speech — even in advertising."
"in its clearest move yet to woo the healthcare industry, apple has collaborated with the health insurance provider aetna to launch a new app, called attain, that uses apple watch data to provide a window into users’ health. the launch stems from a 2016 collaboration between the insurer and apple that saw 90 percent of participants in a study reported a health benefit from using their apple watch. both apple and google (through its parent company, alphabet) have been making headway into personalized health using wearables. earlier this month, alphabet’s verily business unit had its wearable device approved by the fda for tracking heart health. apple had received its approval from the fda in september 2018 when it launched a new version of the apple watch. alphabet’s verily scores fda clearance for its ecg monitor “we believe that people should be able to play a more active role in managing their well-being. every day, we receive emails and letters from people all over the world who have found great benefit by incorporating apple watch into their lives and daily routines,” said jeff williams, apple’s coo. “as we learn over time, the goal is to make more customized recommendations that will help members accomplish their goals and live healthier lives.” healthcare has been on apple’s radar since at least 2016, when tim cook targeted it as an area the company was looking to pursue in an interview with fast company: “we’ve gotten into the health arena and we started looking at wellness, that took us to pulling a string to thinking about research, pulling that string a little further took us to some patient-care stuff, and that pulled a string that’s taking us into some other stuff,” [cook said at the time]. “when you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of big pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. not thinking about what helps the patient. so if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small.” the new attain app consists of four pillars divided into achieving activity goals; sustaining everyday health, personalized health notifications; and rewards for achievements. the app determines personalized activity goals based on age, sex and weight, and includes a more varied array of potential activities than just steps taken — using the apple watch to measure swimming and yoga as potential activities. aetna’s app will also offer challenges where participants earn points for taking actions like getting more sleep, engaging in meditation activities and monitoring and improving their diet. attain will also recommend health actions based on the healthcare reports culled from the health records that aetna’s patient population shares through the app. created alongside physicians, the app uses doctor-recommended clinical guidelines and will incorporate prompts for healthy actions, like getting flu shots and vaccinations, refilling medication prescriptions when they’re scheduled to run out; suggesting visits to primary care physicians if checkups have lagged and prompting about lower-cost options for lab tests. finally, users can earn rewards — like points off the cost of their apple watch or gift cards to national stores. the app is available to aetna members who have an iphone 5s or later and an apple watch series 1 or later. “from fitness enthusiasts, to casual gym-goers, to parents who get all their exercise by keeping up with their kids – we designed attain for everyone,” said alan lotvin, m.d., executive vice president of transformation for cvs health, in a statement. “we understand that you don’t need to be a personal trainer or work out several hours a day to be healthier. we’re designing attain to be personalized and clinically relevant to where each individual is in their health journey. this is an ambitious challenge, and we will adapt and improve over time to create the best experience for our members.” after users have signed up with the attain app they can share data and health history with apple, giving both companies access to data that can be used later for potential clinical trials or to make predictions abut population health… while the companies are pitching it as a way to get more personalized suggestions from the app. according to a statement from the company, all the health data is encrypted on the device, in transit and on apple and aetna’s servers where it is stored in a hipaa-compliant way. the companies also say that the data won’t be used for underwriting, premium or coverage decisions. in the future you could see apple and aetna collaborating to make apple watches an employee benefit — like computers — to track employee health and lower healthcare costs. it’d be a win-win for both. but as apple pushes deeper into collecting health records and data, the company is setting a high bar for its security protocols at a time when the company is still cleaning up the mess from a bug that left facetime users exposed."
"openai may not be quite so open going forward. the former nonprofit announced today that it is restructuring as a “capped-profit” company that cuts returns from investments past a certain point. but some worry that this move — or rather the way they made it — may result in making the innovative company no different from the other ai startups out there. from now on, profits from any investment in the openai lp (limited partnership, not limited profit) will be passed on to an overarching nonprofit company, which will disperse them as it sees fit. profits in excess of a 100x return, that is. in simplified terms, if you invested $10 million today, the profit cap will come into play only after that $10 million has generated $1 billion in returns. you can see why some people are concerned that this structure is “limited” in name only. in a blog post, openai explained the rationale behind its decision: we’ll need to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large-scale cloud compute, attracting and retaining talented people, and building ai supercomputers. we want to increase our ability to raise capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we know of strikes the right balance. our solution is to create openai lp as a hybrid of a for-profit and nonprofit—which we are calling a “capped-profit” company. essentially, the company is admitting that it was unlikely to raise the money necessary to achieve its goals while operating as a nonprofit — which, as you can imagine, investors see no immediate returns on. (although it’s possible to make money on spin-offs and other sub-businesses, putting money into a nonprofit isn’t really a lucrative move.) less money wouldn’t be as big a problem if openai were not competing with the likes of google and amazon for specialists in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and so on. the cost of development is also quite high. this of course was also true (though perhaps less acute) in 2015 when openai was started. yet as the founders wrote then: our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact. that doesn’t leave a lot of room for interpretation! but having said that, openai isn’t the first nonprofit to stumble on the money issue; the simple fact is that it’s hard to outspend global megacorps in a field where success is at least partly determined by budget. and in a way, perhaps they reasoned, isn’t being profitable sort of being “free from financial obligations?” think about it. openai’s robotic hand doesn’t need humans to teach it human behaviors the new structure has openai lp doing the actual work the company is known for: doing interesting and perhaps widely applicable ai research, occasionally withheld in order to save the world. but the lp will be “governed” by openai inc., aka openai nonprofit (this structure is explained a bit more below). profits emerging from the lp in excess of the 100x multiplier go to the nonprofit, which will use it to run educational programs and advocacy work. the company justifies this rather high profit “cap” by saying that if it succeeds in creating a working artificial general intelligence (agi is a poorly defined concept that is nonetheless perhaps the holy grail of current ai research), “we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we’d owe to people who invest in or work at openai lp.” openai’s logo it’s a little like offering great terms on martian real estate (buy now before it’s crowded!). whether these are the words of confidence workers, or merely confident ones, is pretty much entirely a matter of opinion. agi is nowhere near being achieved or the idea even properly understood, as any researcher will tell you, but if it can be achieved it is far more likely to be done by people on the leading edge who have access to large budgets and enormous computing resources. as chief scientist ilya sutskever put it in a reddit comment moments ago: “there is no way of staying at the cutting edge of ai research, let alone building agi, without us massively increasing our compute investment.” whatever agi is, it won’t come cheap. all the same, the 100x number seems like rather a large jump. many of the same goals might have been achieved with a 10x or 20x multiplier, which would allow for huge returns without near-term profits appearing to be unlimited in practice. future rounds will in fact be offered at a smaller multiplier; this one is meant to be a carrot for investors willing to tolerate a bit more risk. but it has rubbed some the wrong way, and it’s easy to understand grumbling that the company that not long ago said it wanted to be “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” will now make decisions very much informed by that need. how does that differ from the megacorps with which openai has attempted to contrast itself? the ceo of the whole operation is sam altman, who stepped down as chairman at y combinator just days ago, leading speculation that he was upping his involvement in another concern; now we know which. did sam altman make yc better or worse? policy director for openai (though for which, who can say?) jack clark explained in a bit more detail in an email to techcrunch. “in practice, you should think about openai as being led on research and technology by ilya sutskever (chief scientist) and greg brockman (cto), with sam helping out on other aspects of management,” he wrote. “we’ve all been working together for a while, so this isn’t much of a shift internally.” the board consists of openai’s brockman, sutskever and altman, original investor but non-employee reid hoffman, as well as adam d’angelo, holden karnofsky, sue yoon and tasha mccauley. notably elon musk isn’t a part of it, though he was a big investor and proponent early on; he departed more than a year back on good terms. the board is limited to a minority of financially interested parties, and only non-interested members can vote on “decisions where the interests of limited partners and openai nonprofit’s mission may conflict,” the announcement noted. so theoretically the keys to the safe are in the hands of those who have no incentive to rifle it. clark noted that “we’ve been talking to everyone involved for more than a year about this, so everyone was aware.” openai lp, which we will likely end up just calling openai, will continue its work uninterrupted, it says, even “at increased pace and scale.” so you can expect important papers and work like it has published before, though from now on you will be much more justified in attributing a profit motive to it."
"you might not think of self-driving technologies and politics having much in common, but at least in one way, they overlap meaningfully: yesterday’s enemy can be tomorrow’s ally. such was the message we gleaned thursday night at a strictlyvc event in san francisco, where we had the chance to sit down with chris urmson, the co-founder and ceo of aurora, a company that (among many others) is endeavoring to make self-driving technologies a safer and more widely adopted alternative to human drivers. it was a big day for urmson. that morning, his two-year-old company announced a whopping $530 million in series b funding, a round that was led by top firm sequoia capital and that included “significant investment” from t. rowe price and amazon. the financing for aurora — which is building what it calls a “driver” technology that it expects to eventually integrate into cars built by volkswagen, hyundai and china’s byton, among others — is highly notable, even in a sea of giant fundings. not only does it represent sequoia’s biggest bet yet on any kind of self-driving technology, it’s also an “incredible endorsement” from t. rowe price, said urmson thursday night, suggesting it demonstrates that the money management giant “thinks long term and strategically [that] we’re the independent option to self-driving cars.” even more telling, perhaps, is the participation of amazon, which is in constant competition to be the world’s most valuable company, and whose involvement could lead to a variety of scenarios down the road, from aurora powering delivery fleets overseen by amazon, to amazon acquiring aurora outright. amazon has already begun marketing more aggressively to global car companies and tier 1 suppliers that are focused on building connected products, saying its aws platform can help them speed their pace of innovation and lower their cost structures. in november, it also debuted a global, autonomous racing league for 1/18th scale, radio-controlled, self-driving four-wheeled race cars that are designed to help developers learn about reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning. imagine what it could learn from aurora. indeed, at the event, urmson said that as aurora had “constructed our funding round, [we were] very much thinking strategically about how to be successful in our mission of building a driver. and one thing that a driver can do is move people, but it can also move goods. and it’s harder to think of a company where moving goods is more important than amazon.” added urmson, “having the opportunity to have them partner with us in this funding round, and [talk about] what we might build in the future is awesome.” (aurora’s site also now features language about “transforming the way people and goods move.”) the interest of amazon, t. rowe, sequoia and aurora’s other backers isn’t surprising. urmson was the formal technical lead of google’s self-driving car program (now waymo) . one of his co-founders, drew bagnell, is a machine learning expert who still teaches at carnegie mellon and was formerly the head of uber’s autonomy and perception team. aurora’s third co-founder is sterling anderson, who led tesla’s autopilot team. aurora’s big round seemingly spooked tesla investors, in fact, with shares in the electric car maker dropping as media outlets reported on the details. the development seems like just the type of possibility that had tesla ceo elon musk unsettled when aurora got off the ground a couple of years ago and tesla immediately filed a lawsuit against it, accusing urmson and anderson of trying to poach at least a dozen tesla engineers and accusing anderson of taking confidential information and destroying the  evidence “in an effort to cover his tracks.” that suit was dropped two and a half weeks later in a settlement that saw aurora pay $100,000. anderson said at the time the amount was meant to cover the cost of an independent auditor to scour aurora’s systems for confidential tesla information. urmson reiterated on thursday night that it was purely an “economic decision” meant to keep aurora from getting further embroiled in an expensive spat. but urmson, who has previously called the lawsuit “classy,” didn’t take the bait on thursday when asked about musk, including whether he has talked in the last two years with musk (no), and whether aurora might need tesla in the future (possibly). instead of lording aurora’s momentum over the company, urmson said that aurora and tesla “got off on the wrong foot.” laughing a bit, he went on to lavish some praise on the self-driving technology that lives inside tesla cars, adding that “if there’s an opportunity to work with them in the future, that’d be great.” aurora, which is also competing now against the likes of uber, also sees uber as a potential partner down the line, said urmson. asked about the company’s costly self-driving efforts, whose scale has been drastically downsized in the 11 months since one of its vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in arizona, urmson noted simply that aurora is “in the business of delivering the driver, and uber needs a lot of drivers, so we think it would be wonderful to partner with them, to partner with lyft, to partner [with companies with similar ambitions] globally. we see those companies as partners in the future.” he added, when asked for more specifics, that there’s “nothing to talk about right now.” before thursday’s event, aurora had sent us some more detailed information about the four divisions that currently employ the 200 people that make up the company, a number that will obviously expand with its new round, as will the testing it’s doing, both on california roads and in pittsburgh, where it also has a sizable presence. we didn’t have a chance to run them during our conversation with urmson, but we thought they were interesting and that you might think so, too. below, for example, is the “hub” of the aurora driver. this is the computer system that powers, coordinates and fuses signals from all of the vehicle’s sensors, executes the software and controls the vehicle. aurora says it’s designing the aurora driver to seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of vehicle platforms from different makes, models and classes. and here is a visual representation of aurora’s perception system, which the company says is able to understand complex urban environments where vehicles need to safely navigate amid many moving objects, including bikes, scooters, pedestrians and cars. it didn’t imagine it would at the outset, but aurora is also building its own mapping system to ensure what it (unsurprisingly) calls the highest level of precision and scalability, so vehicles powered by the company can understand where they are and update the maps as the world changes. we asked urmson if, when the tech is finally ready to go into cars, aurora will white-label the technology or else its customers will use aurora’s brand as a selling point. he said the matter hasn’t been decided yet but seemed to suggest that aurora is leaning in the latter direction. he also said the technology would be installed on the carmakers’ factory floors (with aurora’s help). one of the ways that aurora says it’s able to efficiently develop a robust “driver” is to build its own simulation system. it uses its simulator to test its software with different scenarios that vehicles encounter on the road, which it says enables repeatable testing that’s impossible to achieve by just driving more miles. you can see a seemingly see a merger happening in the graphic. aurora’s motion planning team works closely with the perception team to create a system that both detects the important objects on and around the road, and tries to accurately predict how they will move in the future. the ability to capture, understand and predict the motion of other objects is critical if the tech is going to navigate real-world scenarios in dense urban environments, and urmson has said in the past that aurora’s workflow in this area is superior to competitors that send the technology back and forth between teams. specifically, he told the atlantic last year: “the classic way you engineer a system like this is that you have a team working on perception. they go out and make it as good as they can, and they get to a plateau and hand it off to the motion-planning people. and they write the thing that figures out where to stop or how to change a lane, and it deals with all the noise that’s in the perception system because it’s not seeing the world perfectly. it has errors. maybe it thinks it’s moving a little faster or slower than it is. maybe every once in a while it generates a false positive. the motion-planning system has to respond to that. “so the motion-planning people are lagging behind the perception people, but they get it all dialed in and it’s working well enough — as well as it can with that level of perception — and then the perception people say, ‘oh, but we’ve got a new push [of code].’ then the motion-planning people are behind the eight ball again, and their system is breaking when it shouldn’t.” we also asked urmson about google, whose self-driving unit was renamed waymo as it spun out from the alphabet umbrella as its own company. he was highly diplomatic, saying only good things about his former employer and, when asked if the company ever challenged him on anything since leaving (as tesla had challenged anderson), he said it had not. still, he told us one of the biggest advantages that aurora enjoys is that it was able to use the learnings of its three founders and to start from scratch, whereas big companies cannot. as he also told techcrunch in a separate interview last year, when it comes to creating effective self-driving tech, size matters less than one might imagine. “there’s this really easy metric that everyone is using, which is number of miles driven, and it’s one of those things that was really convenient for me in my old place [google] because we’re out there and we were doing a hell of a lot more than anybody else was at the time, and so it was an easy number to talk about. what’s lost in that, though, is it’s not really the volume of the miles that you drive.” it’s about the quality of the data, he’d continued, suggesting that, for now, at least, aurora’s is hard to beat."
"there’s a trend here. after samsung and vizio, lg is also adding support for apple’s ecosystem to its tv operating system webos. specifically, people who buy an lg tv in 2019 should be able to share content to their tvs using airplay 2. tvs will also be compatible with homekit, letting you create custom scenarios and control your tv using siri. “many of our customers may also happen to have apple devices,” senior director of home entertainment product marketing tim alessi said during the company’s ces press conference. “lg has been working with apple as well to create a streamlined user experience. so i’m very pleased to announce today that we’re adding apple airplay to our 2019 tvs.” if you have an iphone, ipad or mac, you can send video content to your tv using the airplay icon in your favorite video app. you can also mirror your display in case you want to show some non-video content. 2019 lg tvs also support airplay audio, which means that you can send music and podcasts on your tv, pair your tv with other airplay 2-compatible speakers. new lg tvs also support homekit. it means that you can add your tv to the home app on your ios device and mac. after that, you can control basic tv features from the home app. you can also assign siri keywords so that you can manage your tv using siri on your ios device or homepod. homekit support lets you create custom actions. for instance, you can say “hey siri, turn on the tv” and have siri turn on the tv and dim your philips hue lights. unlike samsung, lg didn’t announce an itunes app. so you can’t rent or buy movies and tv shows straight from your tv. buying something from your phone and then using airplay is still a bit clunky. lg also said that 2019 tvs come with amazon alexa and google assistant support. but this is less surprising as you can find hundreds of devices that support those voice assistants. finally, the company is adding a home dashboard to control a wide variety of home devices from your tv. details are still thin on this feature. it’s unclear whether lg will roll out some of all of these software features to old tvs. watching all tv manufacturers add airplay and homekit support one by one reminds me of the year tv manufacturers all announced native netflix apps for their tv. it’s clear that apple is following in netflix’s footsteps and opening up. apple has been working on a subscription-based streaming service for months. and the company wants to support as many devices as possible."
"google showed off virtual reality designed around cardboard in 2014, but it looks like nintendo is ready to get in on the action now as well with a new labo vr kit for the switch that puts the system inches from your face. in labo fashion, there are some pretty outlandish projects to be built here. one of the projects involves the headset turning into an elephant mask with the controllers mounted to the trunk. the main vr kit retails for $79.99, which contains all six of the toy-con projects, including the aforementioned elephant, vr goggles, a blaster, camera, bird and a wind pedal. you can also buy a $39.99 starter kit and purchase additional kits online after.   [gallery ids=""1793837,1793839,1793836,1793838,1793840""] this is hardly playstation vr, but like nintendo’s other labo demos, it looks like the aim is more around building out a fun concept rather than seriously engaging with a new form factor or gameplay mechanic. the switch isn’t a natural fit for virtual reality, largely due to the fact that a 720p screen split for two eyes results in an incredibly low-res experience. though the content looks like a lot of fun, this doesn’t sound very comfortable in my opinion. you don’t have to use the switch in vr mode to play with the labo vr projects though; nintendo says you can also play without mounting your switch to your face. experience a new dimension with the latest #nintendolabo kit! with more games & creations than any previous kit, nintendo labo toy-con 04: vr kit is a unique first vr experience kids & families can build themselves! arriving 4/12, only on #nintendoswitch.https://t.co/pcxm9szsed pic.twitter.com/b21fa2flcq — nintendo of america (@nintendoamerica) march 7, 2019 the kit is a way to “introduce virtual reality in a way that’s fun and approachable for both kids and kids at heart,” nintendo of america incoming president doug bowser said in a statement. the sets launch april 12."
"nyc and boston were handed huge setbacks this week when amazon and ge decided to bail on their commitments to build headquarters in the respective cities on the same day. but it’s worth pointing out that while these large tech organizations were pulling out, google was expanding in both locations. yesterday, upon hearing about amazon’s decision to scrap its hq2 plans in long island city, new york city mayor de blasio had this to say: “instead of working with the community, amazon threw away that opportunity. we have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. if amazon can’t recognize what that’s worth, its competitors will.” one of them already has. google had already announced a billion-dollar expansion in hudson square at the end of last year. google is spending $1 billion to build a massive new campus in new york in fact, the company is pouring billions into nyc real estate, with plans to double its 7,000-person workforce over the next 10 years. as techcrunch’s jon russell reported, “our investment in new york is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in u.s. facilities, offices and jobs. in fact, we’re growing faster outside the bay area than within it, and this year opened new offices and data centers in locations like detroit, boulder, los angeles, tennessee and alabama, wrote google cfo ruth porat.” just this week, as ge was making its announcement, google was announcing a major expansion in cambridge, the city across the river from boston that is home to harvard and mit. kendall square is also home to offices from facebook, microsoft, ibm, akamai, digitalocean and a plethora of startups. google will be moving into a brand new building that currently is home to the mit coop bookstore. it plans to grab 365,000 square feet of the new building when it’s completed, and, as in nyc, will be adding hundreds of new jobs to the 1,500 already in place. brian cusack, google cambridge site lead points out the company began operations in cambridge back in 2003 and has been working on search, android, cloud, youtube, google play, research, ads and more. “this new space will provide room for future growth and further cements our commitment to the cambridge community. we’re proud to call this city home and will continue to support its vibrant nonprofit and growing business community,” he said in a statement. as we learned this week, big company commitments can vanish just as quickly as they are announced, but for now at least, it appears that google is serious about its commitment to new york and boston and will be expanding office space and employment to the tune of thousands of jobs over the next decade. boston and ny share high-tech losses as ge and amazon bail on same day"
"if you’re a video creator in 2019, you’re probably thinking about a long list of publishing destinations: youtube, of course, but also facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat and more. staytuned digital is a new startup trying to help video creators and publishers push their content to multiple platforms. the company, which bills itself as “content’s best friend,” is officially unveiling its product today and announcing that it’s raised $2.5 million in funding. staytuned was founded by ceo serge kassardjian (previously the global head of media app business development for google play) and randy jimenez (previously cto at singleplatform). kassardjian told me he saw the need for a product like this during his time at google, when he would talk to content creators becoming “overwhelmed” by the fragmentation across all the different devices and platforms available to them. “what’s happened is every single one of the platforms is releasing new formats, new ways to optimize, it’s constantly changing every couple of months,” kassardjian said. so with staytuned, publishers shouldn’t have to worry about all that. kassardjian said the product does three big things: optimizes the video so it looks good and can perform well on each platform, pushes the video to each platform and then measures the results, which feeds back into the optimization. buzzfeed will cut its staff by 15% in major round of layoffs kassardjian acknowledged that getting into the media business, even as a technology provider, might seem like a bad idea right now, but he said, “there’s a misconception that what’s happening in the world is that media and content is dead, but there’s more media and content than ever before.” nor does kassardjian believe that publishers can stop relying on facebook and other platforms. sure, they may want to drive more traffic to their own properties or launch their own subscription services, but unless they’re netflix-sized, they can’t ignore the big platforms entirely. “we provide ubiquity to where the audience is,” he said. and when he talks about video publishers, he isn’t just thinking about traditional media companies (although he’s looking to work with them too). he also said staytuned could work with newer digital companies, e-commerce retailers and other brands that are creating content — and eventually, small businesses. as for the funding, it was led by bowery capital, with participation from courtsidevc, quaker health, social leverage, liquid 2 ventures, the fund, hive ventures, grape arbor and a number of angel investors. staytuned is also part of the current gct startup-in-residence program."
"despite delivering a q4 earnings revenue beat, google parent company alphabet’s stock is seeing a bit of a drop. the massive search company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, up 22 percent year-over-year with an eps of $12.77. alphabet stock dropped more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. the company’s beat of analyst estimates would have been a miss if not for a $1.3 billion unrealized gain “related to a non-marketable debt security.” alphabet didn’t detail this further, but it kind of skews the earning beat based on what analysts actually had reason to expect. advertising revenues were up 20 percent yoy in q4 to $32.6 billion. “other” revenues (cloud, hardware) were reported at $6.49 billion, up 31 percent year-over-year. “other bets,” which includes ventures like waymo, fiber and verily, saw losses climb sharply to $1.3 billion with revenue sitting at $154 million, short of wall street estimates. a number that analysts were increasingly looking closely at, traffic acquisition costs, climbed to $7.4 billion in q4 up 15 percent year-over-year and up 13 percent from last quarter."
"this is the year when the money spent on digital advertising will finally overtake spending on traditional ads — at least according to the latest forecast from emarketer. the research firm is predicting that u.s. digital ad spend will increase 19.1 percent this year, to $129.3 billion, while traditional advertising will fall 19 percent, to $109.5 billion. that means digital will account for 54.2 percent of the total, while traditional will only represent 45.8 percent. not surprisingly, most of the digital ad money is going to google and facebook . however, emarketer says google’s share of the market will actually decline, from 38.2 percent last year to 37.2 percent this year, and facebook’s share will only grow slightly, from 21.8 percent to 22.1 percent. apparently, amazon is the main beneficiary here, with its u.s. ad business set to expand by more than 50 percent, accounting for 8.8 percent of total spend. “the [amazon] platform is rich with shoppers’ behavioral data for targeting and provides access to purchase data in real-time,” said emarketer forecasting director monica peart in a statement. “this type of access was once only available through the retail partner, to share at their discretion. but with amazon’s suite of sponsored ads, marketers have unprecedented access to the ‘shelves’ where consumers are shopping.” the firm also forecasts that by 2023, digital will account for more than two-thirds of total ad spending. digital ad spending grew to $49.5b in the first half of 2018, according to iab"
"alphabet’s self-driving vehicle subsidiary waymo may raise outside capital for the first time at a valuation “at least several times” that of cruise, the general motors-owned autonomous vehicle business worth nearly $15 billion, according to a report published by the information on monday. we’ve reached out to our sources to confirm. waymo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. waymo, which is currently celebrating its 10-year anniversary, is a cash-intensive unit. raising capital from outside investors, a move said to be encouraged by chief financial officer ruth porat, would help limit costs and would allow alphabet the opportunity to display waymo’s valuation for the first time in several years. alphabet, however, does not want to relinquish too much equity in the business, formerly known as “project chauffeur,” per the information’s reporting. waymo, years ago, was valued at $4.5 billion, though analysts claim it could surpass a valuation as high as $175 billion based on future revenue estimates. for context, a valuation north of $100 billion puts waymo significantly ahead of uber, tesla, gm and ford. google, currently touting an $817 billion market cap, can afford to support waymo. this, however, is not the search engine’s first time seeking third-party investors for its very own moonshot bets rather than continuing to deploy solely its own capital to the businesses. both verily, a google-owned life sciences research and engineering organization, and makani, a wind energy business also spun out of google x, have sold equity to silver lake and shell, respectively. cruise, for its part, has similarly sought outside capital since being acquired by gm in 2016 for $581 million. in mid-2018, the vision fund invested $2.25 billion in cruise, giving softbank a nearly 20 percent stake in gm’s self-driving business. waymo became a standalone business in 2016 and is today managed by chief executive officer john krafcik, porat and chief technology officer dmitri dolgov. the company made headlines late last year when it launched waymo one, a commercial robotaxi service in the phoenix area — its first profitable endeavor. more recently, waymo announced it would sell its custom light detection and ranging sensors, or lidar, to companies outside the self-driving car industry in another move toward profitability. according to estimates, waymo could book $114 billion in revenue in 2030. waymo cto on the company’s past, present and what comes next"
"“the book itself is a curious artefact, not showy in its technology but complex and extremely efficient: a really neat little device, compact, often very pleasant to look at and handle, that can last decades, even centuries. it doesn’t have to be plugged in, activated, or performed by a machine; all it needs is light, a human eye, and a human mind. it is not one of a kind, and it is not ephemeral. it lasts. it is reliable. if a book told you something when you were 15, it will tell it to you again when you’re 50, though you may understand it so differently that it seems you’re reading a whole new book.”—ursula k. le guin every year, bill gates goes off-grid, leaves friends and family behind, and spends two weeks holed up in a cabin reading books. his annual reading list rivals oprah’s book club as a publishing kingmaker. not to be outdone, mark zuckerberg shared a reading recommendation every two weeks for a year, dubbing 2015 his “year of books.” susan wojcicki, ceo of youtube, joined the board of room to read when she realized how books like the evolution of calpurnia tate were inspiring girls to pursue careers in science and technology. many a biotech entrepreneur treasures a dog-eared copy of daniel suarez’s change agent, which extrapolates the future of crispr. noah yuval harari’s sweeping account of world history, sapiens, is de rigueur for silicon valley nightstands. this obsession with literature isn’t limited to founders. investors are just as avid bookworms. “reading was my first love,” says angellist’s naval ravikant. “there is always a book to capture the imagination.” ravikant reads dozens of books at a time, dipping in and out of each one nonlinearly. when asked about his preternatural instincts, lux capital’s josh wolfe advised investors to “read voraciously and connect dots.” foundry group’s brad feld has reviewed 1,197 books on goodreads and especially loves science fiction novels that “make the step function leaps in imagination that represent the coming dislocation from our current reality.” this begs a fascinating question: why do the people building the future spend so much of their scarcest resource — time — reading books? image by niserin via getty images. reading time approximately 14 minutes. don’t predict, reframe do innovators read in order to mine literature for ideas? the kindle was built to the specs of a science fictional children’s storybook featured in neal stephenson’s novel the diamond age, in fact, the kindle project team was originally codenamed “fiona” after the novel’s protagonist. jeff bezos later hired stephenson as the first employee at his space startup blue origin. but this literary prototyping is the exception that proves the rule. to understand the extent of the feedback loop between books and technology, it’s necessary to attack the subject from a less direct angle. david mitchell’s cloud atlas is full of indirect angles that all manage to reveal deeper truths. it’s a mind-bending novel that follows six different characters through an intricate web of interconnected stories spanning three centuries. the book is a feat of pure m.c. escher-esque imagination, featuring a structure as creative and compelling as its content. mitchell takes the reader on a journey ranging from the 19th century south pacific to a far-future korean corpocracy and challenges the reader to rethink the very idea of civilization along the way. “power, time, gravity, love,” writes mitchell. “the forces that really kick ass are all invisible.” the technological incarnations of these invisible forces are precisely what kevin kelly seeks to catalog in the inevitable. kelly is an enthusiastic observer of the impact of technology on the human condition. he was a co-founder of wired, and the insights explored in his book are deep, provocative, and wide-ranging. in his own words, “when answers become cheap, good questions become more difficult and therefore more valuable.” the inevitable raises many important questions that will shape the next few decades, not least of which concern the impacts of ai: “over the past 60 years, as mechanical processes have replicated behaviors and talents we thought were unique to humans, we’ve had to change our minds about what sets us apart. as we invent more species of ai, we will be forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique about humans. each step of surrender—we are not the only mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent a mathematical law—will be painful and sad. we’ll spend the next three decades—indeed, perhaps the next century—in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for. if we aren’t unique toolmakers, or artists, or moral ethicists, then what, if anything, makes us special? in the grandest irony of all, the greatest benefit of an everyday, utilitarian ai will not be increased productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of doing science—although all those will happen. the greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that ais will help define humanity. we need ais to tell us who we are.” it is precisely this kind of an ai-influenced world that richard powers describes so powerfully in his extraordinary novel the overstory: “signals swarm through mimi’s phone. suppressed updates and smart alerts chime at her. notifications to flick away. viral memes and clickable comment wars, millions of unread posts demanding to be ranked. everyone around her in the park is likewise busy, tapping and swiping, each with a universe in his palm. a massive, crowd-sourced urgency unfolds in like-land, and the learners, watching over these humans’ shoulders, noting each time a person clicks, begin to see what it might be: people, vanishing en masse into a replicated paradise.” taking this a step further, virginia heffernan points out in magic and loss that living in a digitally mediated reality impacts our inner lives at least as much as the world we inhabit: “the internet suggests immortality—comes just shy of promising it—with its magic. with its readability and persistence of data. with its suggestion of universal connectedness. with its disembodied imagines and sounds. and then, just as suddenly, it stirs grief: the deep feeling that digitization has cost us something very profound. that connectedness is illusory; that we’re all more alone than ever.” and it is the questionable assumptions underlying such a future that nick harkaway enumerates in his existential speculative thriller gnomon: “imagine how safe it would feel to know that no one could ever commit a crime of violence and go unnoticed, ever again. imagine what it would mean to us to know—know for certain—that the plane or the bus we’re travelling on is properly maintained, that the teacher who looks after our children doesn’t have ugly secrets. all it would cost is our privacy, and to be honest who really cares about that? what secrets would you need to keep from a mathematical construct without a heart? from a card index? why would it matter? and there couldn’t be any abuse of the system, because the system would be built not to allow it. it’s the pathway we’re taking now, that we’ve been on for a while.”  machine learning pioneer, former president of google china, and leading chinese venture capitalist kai-fu lee loves reading science fiction in this vein — books that extrapolate ai futures — like hao jingfang’s hugo award-winning folding beijing. lee’s own book, ai superpowers, provides a thought-provoking overview of the burgeoning feedback loop between machine learning and geopolitics. as ai becomes more and more powerful, it becomes an instrument of power, and this book outlines what that means for the 21st century world stage: “many techno-optimists and historians would argue that productivity gains from new technology almost always produce benefits throughout the economy, creating more jobs and prosperity than before. but not all inventions are created equal. some changes replace one kind of labor (the calculator), and some disrupt a whole industry (the cotton gin). then there are technological changes on a grander scale. these don’t merely affect one task or one industry but drive changes across hundreds of them. in the past three centuries, we’ve only really seen three such inventions: the steam engine, electrification, and information technology.” so what’s different this time? lee points out that “ai is inherently monopolistic: a company with more data and better algorithms will gain ever more users and data. this self-reinforcing cycle will lead to winner-take-all markets, with one company making massive profits while its rivals languish.” this tendency toward centralization has profound implications for the restructuring of world order: “the ai revolution will be of the magnitude of the industrial revolution—but probably larger and definitely faster. where the steam engine only took over physical labor, ai can perform both intellectual and physical labor. and where the industrial revolution took centuries to spread beyond europe and the u.s., ai applications are already being adopted simultaneously all across the world.” cloud atlas, the inevitable, the overstory, gnomon, folding beijing, and ai superpowers might appear to predict the future, but in fact they do something far more interesting and useful: reframe the present. they invite us to look at the world from new angles and through fresh eyes. and cultivating “beginner’s mind” is the problem for anyone hoping to build or bet on the future."
"if you’re like me, you let out a heavy sigh every month or so when you reach out and unexpectedly find an empty bag of coffee. bottomless, one of the 200-plus startups in y combinator’s latest batch, has a solution for us caffeine addicts. for a $36 annual membership fee, a cost which co-founder michael mayer says isn’t set in stone, plus $11.29 per order depending on the blend, bottomless will automatically restock your coffee supply before you run out. how? the startup sends its members an internet-connected scale free of charge, which members place under their bag of coffee grounds. tracking the weight of the bag, bottomless’ scales determine when customers are low on grounds and ensure a new bag of previously selected freshly roasted coffee is on their doorstep before they run out. voilà, no more coffee-less mornings. founded by seattle-based husband and wife duo mayer and liana herrera in 2016, bottomless began as a passion project for mayer, a former developer at nike.com. herrera kept working as a systems implementations specialist until bottomless secured enough customers to justify the pair working on the project full-time. that was in 2018; months later, after their second attempt at applying, they were admitted into the y combinator accelerator program. bottomless’ smart scale bottomless today counts around 400 customers and has inked distribution deals with four barrel and philz coffee, among other roasters. including the $150,000 investment yc provides each of its startups, bottomless previously raised a pre-seed round from san francisco and seattle-area angel investors. before relocating to san francisco for yc, the bottomless founders were working feverishly out of their seattle home. “this whole time we’ve been 3d-printing prototypes out of our apartment and soldering them together out of our apartment,” mayer told techcrunch. “we kind of turned our place into this new manufacturing facility. there’s dust everywhere and it’s crazy. but we made 150 units ourselves by hand-soldering and lots of burned fingers.” the long-term goal is to automate the restocking process of several household items, like pet food, soap and shampoo. their challenge will be getting customers to keep multiple smart scales in their homes as opposed to just asking their digital assistant to order them some coffee or soap on amazon . amazon recently announced it was doing away with its stick-on dash buttons, iot devices capable of self-ordering on amazon. the devices launched in 2015 before google homes and amazon alexas hit the mainstream. so why keep a smart scale in your kitchen as opposed to just asking a digital assistant to replenish your supply? mayer says it’s coffee quality that keeps it competitive. “some of our most enthusiastic customers live out in like deep suburbs far away from city centers, but they really love fresh coffee,” mayer said. “and there’s no way to get fresh coffee if you live 20 or 30 minutes from a city center, right?” “or you might think in a city like san francisco or seattle, you can get freshly roasted coffee pretty easily because there are restaurants all over the place, right?” he added. “that’s certainly true, but it does take a little bit of extra thought to remember to grab it on the right day when you’re running low.” mayer and herrera don’t consider themselves coffee experts, despite now running what is essentially a direct-to-consumer coffee marketplace out of seattle, the coffee capital. “i’m originally from portland and portlanders know a lot about coffee,” mayer said. “i never really considered myself to be a coffee aficionado or a coffee snob in my head, but i guess compared to like the average american from anywhere in the country, i would be just a regular coffee drinker in portland. all i really knew about coffee going into this was that it’s better fresh. that’s it.” bottomless is currently accepting customers in beta. the team will pitch to investors at yc demo days next week."
"well, that didn’t take long. we’re less than 10 days into 2019 and already vietnam is aiming threats at facebook for violating its draconian cybersecurity law, which came into force on january 1. the u.s. social network stands accused of allowing users in vietnam to post “slanderous content, anti-government sentiment and libel and defamation of individuals, organisations and state agencies,” according to a report from state-controlled media vietnam news. the content is said to have been flagged to facebook which, reports say, has “delayed removing” it. that violates the law which — passed last june — broadly forbids internet users from organizing with, or training, others for anti-state purposes, spreading false information, and undermining the nation state’s achievements or solidarity, according to reports at the time. it also requires foreign internet companies to operate a local office and store user information on vietnamese soil. that’s something neither google nor facebook has complied with, despite the vietnamese government’s recent claim that the former is investigating a local office launch. in addition, the authority of broadcasting and electronic information (abei) claimed facebook had violated online advertising rules by allowing accounts to promote fraudulent products and scams, while it is considering penalties for failure to pay tax. the vietnamese report claimed some $235 million was spent on facebook ads in 2018, with $152.1 million going to google. facebook responded by clarifying its existing channels for reporting illegal content. “we have a clear process for governments to report illegal content to us, and we review all these requests against our terms of service and local law. we are transparent about the content restrictions we make in accordance with local law in our transparency report,” a facebook representative told techcrunch in a statement. techcrunch understands that the company is in contact with the vietnamese government and it intends to review content flagged as illegal before making a decision. vietnamese media reports claim that facebook has already told the government that the content in question doesn’t violate its community standards. it looks likely that the new law will see contact from vietnamese government censors spike, but facebook has acted on content before. the company’s latest transparency report covers the first half of 2018 and it shows that it received 12 requests for data in vietnam, granting just two. facebook confirmed it has previously taken action on content that has included the alleged illegal sale of regulated products, trade of wildlife and efforts to impersonate an individual. facebook did not respond to the tax liability claim. the company previously indicated its concern about the cybersecurity law via asia internet coalition (aic) — a group that represents the social media giant as well as google, twitter, linkedin, line and others — which cautioned that the regulations would negatively impact vietnam. “the provisions for data localization, controls on content that affect free speech, and local office requirements will undoubtedly hinder the nation’s fourth industrial revolution ambitions to achieve gdp and job growth,” aic wrote in a statement in june. “unfortunately, these provisions will result in severe limitations on vietnam’s digital economy, dampening the foreign investment climate and hurting opportunities for local businesses and smes to flourish inside and beyond vietnam,” it added. vietnam is increasingly gaining a reputation as a growing market for startups, but the cybersecurity act threatens to impact that. one key issue is that the broad terms appear to give the government significant scope to remove content that it deems offensive. “this decision has potentially devastating consequences for freedom of expression in vietnam. in the country’s deeply repressive climate, the online space was a relative refuge where people could go to share ideas and opinions with less fear of censure by the authorities,” said amnesty international. vietnam news reports that the authorities are continuing to collect evidence against facebook. “if facebook did not take positive steps, vietnamese regulators would apply necessary economic and technical measures to ensure a clean and healthy network environment,” the abei is reported to have said."
"google’s strategy around its consumer messaging services remains baffling, especially since it killed off allo (yet kept duo on life support). today, the company clarified the timeline of the transition from classic hangouts to chat and meet for its paying g suite customers. for them, the hangouts retirement party will start in october of this year. for consumers, the situation remains unclear, but google says there will be free versions of chat and meet that will become available “following the transition of g suite customers.” as of now, there is no timeline, so for all we know, hangouts will remain up and running into 2020. as for g suite users, google says it will start bringing more features from classic hangouts to chat between april and september. those include integration with gmail, the ability to talk to external users, improved video calling and making calls with google voice. google originally started migrating hangouts users to the meet video conferencing service last year. the story there was pretty straightforward, though, given that meet was a new service with new functionality. for hangouts, the story is far more complicated, and hangouts chat isn’t currently available to consumers. they do have the choice between dozens of other messaging apps, though, and all of this confusion is likely to cost google quite a few users. google is killing off allo, its latest messaging app flop"
"here’s a quick tidbit buried beneath today’s deluge of google assistant news (not to mention the bizarre waking nightmare that is the ces small world ride). the company announced today that the smart assistant will be accessible on more android phone lock screens. the feature was first announced back at google’s hardware event in october, though, at the time, it was limited to the company’s new pixel 3 handset. for security reasons, it’s available through opt-in, meaning you’ve got to tick the box in settings. certainly adding that kind of access to the lock screen can open your handset (and by extension you) to malicious parties. though once set up, it will only respond to your own voice (unless, of course, someone with access to your handset can do a really good impression of you). once enabled, you can get restaurant recommendations, turn off alarms and schedule reminders, among other features, all without having to unlock the handset. no word yet on when it will be arriving on specific models."
"i think most of us have had this experience, especially when you’re in a big city: you step off of public transit, take a peek at google maps to figure out which way you’re supposed to go… and then somehow proceed to walk two blocks in the wrong direction. maybe the little blue dot wasn’t actually in the right place yet. maybe your phone’s compass was bugging out and facing the wrong way because you’re surrounded by 30-story buildings full of metal and other things that compasses hate. google maps’ work-in-progress augmented reality mode wants to end that scenario, drawing arrows and signage onto your camera’s view of the real world to make extra, super sure you’re heading the right way. it compares that camera view with its massive collection of street view imagery to try to figure out exactly where you’re standing and which way you’re facing, even when your gps and/or compass might be a little off. it’s currently in alpha testing, and i spent some hands-on time with it this morning. a little glimpse of what it looks like in action: https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/narrow.mp4 google first announced ar walking directions about nine months ago at its i/o conference, but has been pretty quiet about it since. much of that time has been spent figuring out the subtleties of the user interface. if they drew a specific route on the ground, early users tried to stand directly on top of the line when walking, even if it wasn’t necessary or safe. when they tried to use particle effects floating in the air to represent paths and curves (pictured below in any early prototype) a google ux designer tells us one user asked why they were ‘following floating trash’. the maps team also learned that no one wants to hold their phone up very long. the whole experience has to be pretty quick, and is designed to be used in short bursts — in fact, if you hold up the camera for too long, the app will tell you to stop. firing up ar mode feels like starting up any other google maps trip. pop in your destination, hit the walking directions button… but instead of “start”, you tap the new “start ar” button. a view from your camera appears on screen, and the app asks you to point the camera at buildings across the street. as you do so, a bunch of dots will pop up as it recognizes building features and landmarks that might help it pinpoint your location. pretty quickly — a few seconds, in our handful of tests — the dots fade away, and a set of arrows and markers appear to guide your way. a small cut-out view at the bottom shows your current location on the map, which does a pretty good job of making the transition from camera mode to map mode a bit less jarring. when you drop the phone to a more natural position – closer to parallel with the ground, like you might hold it if you’re reading texts while you walk — google maps will shift back into the standard 2d map view. hold up the phone like you’re taking a portrait photo of what’s in front of you, and ar mode comes back in. in our short test (about 45 minutes in all), the feature worked as promised. it definitely works better in some scenarios than others; if you’re closer to the street and thus have a better view of the buildings across the way, it works out its location pretty quick and with ridiculous accuracy. if you’re in the middle of a plaza, it might take a few seconds longer. google’s decision to build this as something that you’re only meant to use for a few seconds is the right one. between making yourself an easy target for would-be phone thieves or walking into light poles, no one wants to wander a city primarily through the camera lens of their phone. i can see myself using it on the first step or two of a trek to make sure i’m getting off on the right foot, at which point an occasional glance at the standard map will hopefully suffice. it’s about helping you feel more certain, not about holding your hand the entire way. google did a deeper dive on how the tech works here, but in short: it’s taking the view from your camera and sending a compressed version up to the cloud, where it’s analyzed for unique visual features. google has a good idea of where you are from your phones’ gps signal, so it can compare the street view data it has for the surrounding area to look for things it thinks should be nearby — certain building features, statues, or permanent structures — and work backwards to your more precise location and direction. there’s also a bunch of machine learning voodoo going on here to ignore things that might be prominent but not necessarily permanent (like trees, large parked vehicles, and construction.) the feature is currently rolling out to “local guides” for feedback. local guides are an opt-in group of users who contribute reviews, photos, and places while helping google fact check location information in exchange for early access to features like this. alas, google told us repeatedly that it has no idea when it’ll roll out beyond that group."
"amazon is expanding to new markets in europe (france, italy and spain) its program that directly pays alexa developers in cash for building valuable, quality voice apps. originally launched in the u.s. in 2017 for those developers building game skills, the alexa developer rewards program has since expanded to include a broader selection of alexa skills categories, and later became available in top european markets germany and the u.k., as well as in japan and india. with the launch in france, italy and spain, the alexa developer rewards program will now offer payments to top skills in categories such as education & reference; food & drink; games, trivia & accessories; kids; health & fitness; lifestyle; music & audio; and productivity. the program itself is one part of amazon’s larger strategy around building out its ecosystem of voice applications, ahead of developers’ ability to generate sustainable income from their voice apps. though amazon now offers developers other monetization tools like in-skill purchases, one-time purchases and sales of physical goods, it could still be hard for some to make consistent income from voice apps without the additional direct support from amazon. and without revenues to fund development, some might abandon their alexa skills for other efforts. so far, amazon’s decision to invest directly in the developer ecosystem has been working. amazon’s alexa skill store today has the largest number of third-party voice apps, compared with rivals, having hit 80,000 skills as of last month following a holiday shopping season that saw a significant number of alexa-powered devices sold. its growth has come quickly, too, with the number of alexa skills in the u.s. more than doubling over the past year. many of the popular alexa skills so far have turned out to be voice-enabled counterparts to popular mobile apps — especially those that are audio-based, like music apps, spoken word, meditation apps, quizzes and games and workout apps, for example. but key to alexa’s continued growth is ensuring that these sorts of voice apps are available in localized versions in key non-u.s. markets where smart speakers are growing in popularity. that’s a place where google could have an advantage, thanks to google assistant’s advanced language capabilities, which include support for a dozen some languages besides english, plus its multilingual abilities, support for interpretations and more. amazon says it has paid out “millions” to developers based in more than 20 countries since the 2017 launch of the alexa developer rewards program. developers don’t have to sign up for rewards — if the app qualifies, amazon will email them."
"attentive, a techstars boulder alumnus, is closing a $1.2 million seed round co-led by lisbon-based indico capital partners and luxembourg-based mangrove capital partners. this also marks mangrove’s first-ever investment into a portugal-based startup. the southern-european country has surged as a european startup destination with the launch of new funds like indico, acting as host to the giant web summit and offering warmer climes than chilly northern europe. attentive has an “augmented sales assistant,” which allows teams to keep up with their sales pipeline and guides managers to allocate resources better. the new attentive app works with slack, so should fit relatively easily into teams that use that platform, allowing teams to update their crms without needing to open the attentive app itself. ex-googler daniel araújo, co-founder and ceo, says: “a very common problem in sales teams is that more than one-third of their time is ‘lost’ in administrative tasks… technology should aim towards more efficient time management, which is what attentive helps sales teams achieve.” stephan morais, partner at indico capital partners, commented: “enterprise sales and data are two crucial areas in today’s software world if you want to be competitive. attentive is the intelligent layer that merges these and they are doing it at the right time. moreover, the team has the resilience, technical ability and global network to take the company to the next level.” yannick oswald, principal at mangrove, adds: “by automating sales data input for teams across crms and industries, attentive’s ai collects millions of sales actions that go beyond mere transactional database records and can guide users towards behaviors that achieve much better sales outcomes.”"
"tia, the company that launched with an app providing health advice and period tracking for women, has launched its first clinic. from its first location in new york, the two founders of tia hope they can build a network of care facilities that integrate all of the information their app collects with the benefits of having in-person consultations with physicians that have a holistic view of their patients’ health. for founders carolyn witte and felicity yost, the hurdles women need to overcome to receive adequate treatment aren’t theoretical — they’ve faced them directly. witte and yost met a decade ago in college and remained friends ever since. it was when witte had to diagnose herself with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos), a condition that affects nearly one in 10 women, that she first realized how broken the healthcare system was for more than half of the u.s. population. “it’s one of those classic issues in healthcare that’s really difficult to diagnose… i spent three years seeing gynecologists, who were treating the symptom and failing to connect the dots,” witte recalls. “i found myself at age 25 at a fertility specialist in nyc after i diagnosed myself on the internet… and got this really unfortunate diagnosis.” as someone who worked at google and had access to what was supposed to be the best healthcare services in the world, witte realized there were significant gaps between the understanding of healthcare for men and women. “here i am feeling completely alone and confused… that was the moment for me when i said there has to be a better way.” witte moved back to san francisco and moved in with yost and began working on what would become the tia app. initially the app was focused on providing advice to women around sexual health and gynecological issues, eventually expanding to include a period tracker and other tools. now, with the expansion into the clinical space, tia’s founders see it as the culmination of their evolution as a company. “i wanted to build a brand company that makes women feel heard,” says witte. “we wanted to build a one-stop-shop solution that solves the lack of soul in healthcare.” with that mission accomplished, the next step is to grow. growth at the kind of scale that witte and yost envision requires capital, which the two women have received in the form of $6 million in capital commitments from a slew of some of venture capital’s best investors, including john doerr, homebrew, combine, compound, torch capital, canaan partners and define ventures (lynne chou o’keefe from kleiner perkins). “tia is a revolutionary company that is changing the way women view and access healthcare. now, with the launch of the first tia clinic, they’re introducing a new model of women’s care that will shift the landscape with convenience, compassion, and personalization,” said lynne chou o’keefe, in a statement. that sentiment is bound up in the branding of the business. although neither woman is latinx, they called their company tia after the spanish word for aunt — which, can be expanded to include any trusted relationship among women (whether or not they’re actually related), according to witte. the decision to expand from an application into physical clinics was bound up in the use cases the two women saw when they launched their service. “we found very quickly after launching the product that women were hacking tia and bringing their phones into their gynecologist’s office,” witte says. at the newly launched tia clinic, which opens today at its first location in new york near madison square park, the company is providing full-stack care delivery, including gynecological exams, primary care and wellness. the company charges a $150 membership fee, but its services are covered under insurance. tia currently accepts aetna, cigna, humana, oscar, united oxford/united healthcare and empire blue cross blue shield. treatment at the tia clinic is informed by the data that the company’s application collects on its users, both witte and yost say. women can come to the clinic for services ranging from holistic annual exams to iud insertions to treatment for chronic migraines, alongside more mundane services like flu shots and strep throat treatments. if tia users track their cycle and daily health and wellness through the app, that can be shared with their tia clinic physicians to inform care. the medical service at this point doesn’t integrate other period-tracking apps into its health data. at the center of tia’s clinical care is the notion that the menstrual cycle is broadly associated with physiological and emotional manifestations that can inform and effect treatment.  tia isn’t the only company that is trying to bring information and data specific to women’s health into a clinical setting. in oakland, nextgen jane is using tampons and a diagnostics kit to sample and diagnose severe health problems, like endometriosis. and investors are pouring money into period-tracking and fertility apps and services around the country and around the world. as we wrote earlier this month: femtech, a term coined by ida tin,  the founder of another period and ovulation-tracking app clue, is defined as any software, diagnostics, products and services that leverage technology to improve women’s health. femtech, and more specifically the businesses in the fertility and contraception lanes, hasn’t made headlines as often as ai or blockchain technology has, for example. probably because companies in the sector haven’t closed as many notable venture deals. that’s changing. the global fertility services market is expected to exceed $21 billion by 2020, according to technavio. meanwhile, private investment in the femtech space surpassed $400 million in 2018 after reaching a high of $354 million the previous year, per data collected from pitchbook and crunchbase. this year already several companies have inked venture deals, including men’s fertility business dadi and extend fertility, which helps women freeze their eggs. “in the last three to six months, it feels like investor interest has gone through the roof,” jake anderson-bialis, co-founder of fertilityiq and a former investor at sequoia capital, told techcrunch. “it’s three to four emails a day; people are coming out of the woodwork. it feels like somebody shook the snow globe here and it just hasn’t stopped for months now.” it’s a new era for fertility tech for tia, the benefits of understanding menstrual health extend far beyond fertility. “women’s health is cyclic and changes every single day of a woman’s cycle,” says yost. with that said, the company is only just now starting to do clinical research to test the validity of its thesis. “for us to be able to do any sort of clinical research on women is very, very challenging,” says yost. “all of these things can take a really long time because it takes so much information to diagnose.” for investors like homebrew’s hunter walk, companies like tia sit at the intersection of a few promising trends — but the investment was driven by the passion the founders expressed for the mission they were on. “women and specifically millennial women and younger are increasingly becoming targeted by venture-backed companies,” says walk. “for years and years and years that audience was unrecognized and underserved… [but with tia] what we saw was a checkbox on the founders and their abilities. they checked the box on the audience… and because they were going not just with generic women’s health but cycle-targeted women’s care, we thought that was the right and differentiated approach thinking about healthcare for women.”"
"apple is reportedly gearing up for a new streaming tv service to rival netflix, amazon and google this year, but in the meantime, it is also expanding interoperability with more third parties like smart tv makers to make what it already has available easier to use in the living room. in the latest development, smart tv maker vizio today announced at the ces consumer electronics show that it’s adding support for airplay 2 and homekit to its smartcast interactive tv platform. the integration will mean that vizio tv owners can link their other apple devices up to their tvs to browse and watch content from itunes, as well as any photos, videos or music on those devices. then, through homekit, they can also control that content and the rest of the tv using apple’s voice assistant siri. vizio said that the feature will be rolled out first to beta users of the smartcast 3.0 platform in the u.s. and canada in q1 2019. in q2, it will be rolled out to all smartcast tv users via a free, over-the-air update to the 3.0 version of the platform. “at our core, vizio is committed to delivering value. smartcast 3.0 is one of the ways we’re doing just that. by adding support for apple airplay 2 and homekit, users can play content from their iphone, ipad and mac directly to smartcast tvs, and enable tv controls through the home app and siri,” said bill baxter, chief technology officer, vizio, in a statement. he added that this also will make vizio the first smart tv brand to offer the ability for consumers to use any major voice assistant — siri, amazon’s alexa or google assistant (the latter two integrations were added previously) — to control their sets. “we’re excited to be the first in the marketplace to support such a wide range of ways for consumers to sit back and enjoy the entertainment they love.” the google assistant functionality is also expanding to control more services such as the launching of apps and switching inputs. the vizio / apple news comes just one day after vizio’s bigger rival samsung — which has a 33 percent share of the smart tv market in the us compared to vizio’s 24 percent — also debuted an apple airplay integration, along with a new tab directly linking to itunes in samsung’s interactive platform. the itunes app is an exclusive to samsung for the time being, but the vizio deal lays the groundwork for more collaboration between vizio and apple ahead. vizio, notably, is not a direct competitor to apple in other business areas in the way that samsung is. for vizio, this is a significant step ahead for the company at a time when it is playing some catchup against samsung, which once trailed vizio but gradually overtook it as the leading smart tv player. i’d argue that vizio is also still recuperating from its no-good, very bad 2017. its series of unfortunate events included a failed $2 billion acquisition of the company by chinese maker leeco after leeco itself fell apart; a lawsuit against leeco over that deal breaking down; another lawsuit, this time from the ftc (settled for $2.2 million) over snooping on its customers’ viewing habits; and a third suit brought by amd, this time over graphics patent infringement, which amd has since won. this is actually the first time that vizio has been at ces in years, which is also saying something. the company is also using the event to announce its newest range of 4k hdr smart tvs and audio equipment, including sound bars and subwoofers. on the side of apple, taken together, the two integrations with vizio and samsung underscore apple’s challenges and ambitions at the moment. the company last week warned the market that sales of its iphone smartphone — for years now the company’s undisputed growth engine — would be falling short of expectations for a number of reasons. (they included worse-than-expected sales in china, where price and feature competition is fierce; a global slowdown in phone sales as the market saturates; and weaker demand for its new, expensive models. apple, as you know, has over the years been building up a services model to complement its hardware business — with apps, music, video, cloud services and more — and many believe that the company will start to focus on that even more to offset slowdowns in its hardware sales, as well as to boost the sales of that hardware. (hence the rumors of a netflix-style ott video service.) it’s an opportunity for sure, but not a guaranteed win. apple tv — the company’s existing bridge to content on televisions — hasn’t managed to overtake the collective popularity of other smaller middleware like google’s chromecast and amazon’s fire tv and fire stick. and the ott market is very crowded already, with offerings from all of the above, pay-tv providers, smart tv makers and more. given all of the above, it will be worth watching to see who else might have apple-related news this week and if a kinder, more device-agnostic apple-as-services provider emerges as a theme at ces this week."
"if you think times are bad at apple, spare a thought for htc, the once king-of-the-hill phone maker that continues to struggle very badly. the taiwanese smartphone company, which offloaded a portion of its business to google for $1.1 billion and is pivoting to vr, laid off yet more staff in 2018 and had its worst year of sales ever. according to its own figures — and as noted by bloomberg’s tim culpan — the company brought in just 23.74 billion twd ($770 million) in revenue over the entire year. that’s the first time it has grossed less than $1 billion during a year as a public company. that figure represents a massive 62 percent drop on htc’s paltry revenue for 2017 — 62.12 billion twd, around $2 billion — which was its poorest year since 2005. we don’t yet know the total loss for 2018, but its three previous quarterly reports combined amount to a total operating loss of 11.13 billion twd, $361 million, with one more quarter to add.htc’s 2018 total was so bad that it actually made more money during just one single month a few years ago. its total revenue during may 2013, back when phones like the one m7, one mini and one max made it one of the best smartphone companies on the planet, came in at 29 billion twd. those days of booming sales are, of course, long gone as these charts painfully illustrate. the decision to sell a large chunk of the smartphone business to google one year ago was the icing on the cake served at htc’s smartphone wake. yes, the company did announce the u12+ — with a squeezable side — in may and it is working on a blockchain phone that we kind of got a look at during our shenzhen event last year, but these are peripheral plays that are tucked well away from where the mainstream players are dueling, a place where htc used to be.even vr, trumpeted as htc’s great area of hope, is a long-term play. the company doesn’t break down revenue — that’ll come later when it releases its next earnings report in february — so we don’t know how its vive and other virtual reality plays are working out in terms of numbers. but the immediate future isn’t great. lucas matney — techcrunch’s resident virtual reality cyberpunk — noted just this week that 2019 is shaping up to be a very testing year for the entire vr and ar industry, htc/vive very much included. “there are plenty of reasons to be long-term bullish on ar, but the time horizons some have espoused seems to be bogus and pitch decks organized around a near-term spike in phone-based or glasses-based users are going to have a tougher time being taken seriously in 2019,” matney wrote. if that proves true, htc’s sickly sales may well contract further still. htc is gone in many ways, it’s hard to not feel sorry for the company. pivots this brutal are usually carried out by private startups who can keep the contents of their books to themselves, rather than 22-year-old public companies that must file financial statements. unfortunately for htc, information like monthly sales, losses and other revealing data will continue to be public information, ensuring that this painful transition continues to play out with full public scrutiny. despite an incredible downturn in success, co-founder, president and ceo cher wang continues to run the business with no calls for a change in leadership. wang keeps a low profile and has said little of her plans to turn things around. maybe 2019 is a good year for being more forthcoming, especially if the losses continue to mount, as seems inevitable."

"china’s baidu, which is often compared to alphabet’s google, is showing no signs of slowing down its pace of betting on video content as its core advertising unit feels the squeeze from rivals. the company’s latest financial results show its video streaming business iqiyi posted a net loss of 9.1 billion yuan or $1.3 billion in 2018, compared to just 3.74 billion yuan in 2017. not long ago, iqiyi announced raising $500 million in convertible notes to fuel its spending spree. the video site, which filed for a $1.5 billion u.s. ipo last february, aspires to be the “disney of china” with a netflix-style production house and a plan to merchandise a library of intellectual property. baidu also felt the heat as content costs from 2018 jumped 75 percent to $3.42 billion, mainly on account of iqiyi expenses. the cash burn appears to be paying off. iqiyi added 36.6 million subscribers last year, bringing its total users to 87.4 million. and, 98.5 percent of them were paying, a promising ratio, given that chinese users were long used to getting free content in a country with rampant online piracy. by comparison, iqiyi’s most serious contender, tencent video, had 82 million users as of q3. baidu’s video business iqiyi to raise up to $1.5b in us ipo 2018 also turned out to be the first time baidu crossed the 100 billion yuan earnings mark as the firm pocketed 102.3 billion yuan ($14.88 billion) in total revenues, an increase of 28 percent from 2017. in q4 alone, baidu’s total revenues grew 22 percent to $3.96 billion at a slower rate compared to the previous quarter. online advertising from search results, news feed and video content still made up the majority of the company’s income despite the considerable resources the behemoth has poured into autonomous driving and other ai-focused efforts. meanwhile, baidu’s lucrative advertising business is facing heightened competition from bytedance, the fast-ascending new media company with a suite of news and video apps that are proving popular with marketers. the beijing-based firm that’s also unnerved tencent was expected to achieve $7.4 billion in revenues last year, bloomberg reported, citing sources. china’s obsession with short videos has its internet giants worried to fend off attackers, baidu has broadened its advertising inventory beyond the web to include the likes of elevators. in another move, baidu paid $133 million in cash prizes luring users to its namesake search app on the eve of chinese new year. but its search service has over the years been a repeated target for criticism on issues ranging from false medical ads to more recently the subpar quality of its search results. baidu has nonetheless held onto its commanding position in a market where google is absent and smaller players like bing and sogou remain the underdogs. on the ai front, baidu made a total of 13 investments in 2018 that made it the most prolific corporate venture capital focused on the realm, according to a report from cb insights. microsoft’s m12 venture and google ventures followed closely behind. though baidu’s ai business is far from achieving mass commercialization, the segment has scored some notable landmarks. more than 200 million devices now use dueros, the company’s answer to the alexa voice assistant. baidu’s autonomous-driving open platform apollo has accumulated 135 original equipment manufacturers (oems) including volvo, which is working with its chinese ally to deliver level-four self-driving passenger vehicles that can operate on pre-mapped roads with minimum human intervention."
"youtube music is coming to the next critical battlefield for streaming music services: india. the company announced this week it’s launching its ad-supported version of youtube music for free in the country, as well as youtube music premium, its subscription that offers background listening, offline downloads and an ad-free experience for ₹99 a month. in addition, youtube premium, which extends offline play, background listening and the removal of ads across youtube, is also launching in india. this will include access to youtube original programming like cobra kai, bts: burn the stage and others, and ships with the music premium subscription for ₹129 (rupees) per month. this is not google’s first entry into the streaming music market in india. the company already operates google play music — and now, those subscribers will gain access to youtube music as part of their subscription, the company says. india is a key market for streaming services because of its sizable population of 1.3 billion people, many of whom are still coming online for the first time. (only some 483 million are active internet users today). already, apple and amazon operate their music services in the region in addition to local players like gaana, saavn and others. spotify also made an india launch a strategic focus this year. however, spotify’s entry into india has been complicated by a licensing dispute with warner music (wmg’s warner/chappell publishing arm, specifically). that conflict led to spotify arriving in the market without some of today’s biggest artists, like cardi b. and ed sheeran. the case has been ugly: warner sued spotify asking for an emergency injunction; spotify then accused warner of “abusive behavior;” and warner called spotify a “liar.” despite its legal troubles, spotify hit 1 million users in india within a week of launching. that bodes well for its potential when it gets through the legal battles. unlike spotify, youtube music is fully licensed as it enters the region — a potential competitive advantage for the time being. it also has a deal with samsung where galaxy s10 owners can gain four months of youtube premium/youtube music premium for free. (but spotify has a deeper samsung partnership, involving preinstalls and bixby integrations.) for youtube, a win in india is needed, as its streaming music service hasn’t picked up traction to date. to some extent, that’s because youtube users know they can get to music videos for free, but it also has to do with google’s baffling strategy in operating two separate brands around music. apple doesn’t make this mistake. it leverages the power of its platform to promote its only music service, apple music. that may have gotten it into trouble, though — today, spotify filed a complaint with the european commission over the “apple tax” levied on its rivals and its restrictive rules. google has said it plans to merge its two music services at some point, but for now the split likely leads to confusion. “india is where the multi-lingual music scene thrives,” said lyor cohen, global head of music, youtube, in a statement. “it’s interesting to note how indian artists have consistently claimed top spots over the last few months in the global youtube top artists chart. with youtube music, we are hoping to bring the best in global and indian music to millions of fans across india, and give them an immersive music experience, with the magic of music on youtube,” he added."

"this weekend, i finished reading oliver morton’s the planet remade (thanks to reader eliot peper for recommending it). morton has a multitude of goals with the book, but there were two i think are deeply valuable. first, geoengineering is a plausible approach to solving our climate problems this century, and second, engineering the climate generates tough policy challenges, but also opportunities to make the planet more equitable. techcrunch is experimenting with new content forms. this is a rough draft of something new — provide your feedback directly to the author (danny at danny@techcrunch.com) if you like or hate something here. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. first and foremost: the book is mind-expanding in the best way possible. morton confronts an extremely contentious issue with judicious facts and supreme insight gleaned over many years of studying geoengineering. whether you are a dedicated acolyte of cloud seeding and veils or a committed opponent to any tampering of earth’s environment, he has developed a book that forces us to think about our actions and ultimately what the consequences of those choices are. frankly, those choices offer stark consequences. morton describes the challenge of climate this century: the world’s population is expected to grow from seven billion today to more or less ten billion by 2100. by that time the number of people enjoying rich-world energy privileges should also reach ten billion. so the challenge is to achieve for an extra eight billion people in the twenty-first century what was achieved for two billion in the twentieth century. meeting that challenge implies a lot more energy usage. morton is a staunch environmentalist and deeply concerned about environmental justice and the inequities of the planet. but he is also a “climate realist” — he understands that our current solutions to climate change are not really solutions at all, since they either lack the scale required to solve the problem, or will continue to exacerbate existing inequities between different people of this planet. for example, take emissions-free nuclear power, which is brought up as a panacea to our fossil fuel-driven economy. morton writes: if the world had the capacity to deliver one of the largest nuclear power plants ever built once a week, week in and week out, it would take 20 years to replace the current stock of coal-fired plants (at present, the world builds about three or four nuclear power plants a year, and retires old ones almost as quickly). sure, nuclear power plants are a literal solution, but most definitely not a pragmatic one since the scale required is just not there. he also spends significant time deconstructing recent climate negotiations, finding that the focus on carbon has been something of a red herring (many other emissions are far worse than carbon and less directly connected to the modern industrial economy). instead, they have been driven by the alignment of different environmentally-concerned parties: carbon dioxide suited scientists because it seemed like a straightforward measure of the problem. it suited greens because it was a pretty good proxy for the industrial society against which their movement was a reaction. the international negotiations that set up the unfccc showed that it suited developing countries because it was primarily a developed-country issue; at the time of rio, the vast majority of all the industrial emissions since the the eighteenth century had come from europe and america. carbon is of course a problem, but it has become a tagline, a brand, a cri de coeur of the international climate movement. yet the challenges facing the planet are so much deeper than just carbon. to avoid that narrow focus, morton argues for a complete reframing of the climate debate toward solutions that can actually repair the climate, and even improve it for diverse populations around the world. now, the term “geoengineering” brings with it a bag of hollywood-induced imagery of nuclear winters and globe-spanning hurricanes. morton addresses those risks across his chapters, noting that geoengineering can indeed go wrong. even so, he convincingly argues that there are geoengineering techniques designed around key climate processes that can be high leverage, reversible, testable, and that have the scale required to actually solve climate challenges in a sustainable way. these processes aren’t speculation — we (mostly) understand the science today, and have pathways toward the technology required to execute a strategy. the real challenge — as it always is — are humans and their governments. morton notes that climate change has a huge deleterious impact on nations such as maldives, but that it can also benefit certain regions by transitioning them from colder to more temperate climates. that means that any geoengineering solution is going to face the prospect of creating winners and losers. any international agreement is going to have to contend with those politics, and design mechanisms to ameliorate their effects. much as morton calls for a planet remade, he sees an opportunity for geoengineering to trigger reflection among governments on their own interests: much better, rather than treating geoengineering as a technocratic way of avoiding politics, to use it as a way of reinventing politics. exploring the potential of geoengineering could spur and shape the development of a new way of making planetary decisions. the aim should not be the development of a thermostat alone; it should be the development of a new hand to use it. environmentalists may balk at the idea of allowing humans to have their hands on any part of the earth system. but we are here, all seven billion of us, and we already have our brutal hands on the system. the question is whether we can start to use our hands in a far more productive way that can make the earth sustainable for centuries to come. as morton notes, “the planet has been remade, is being remade, will be remade.” geoengineering technologies offer solutions, if we can agree in how to use them. share your feedback on your startup’s attorney my colleague eric eldon and i are reaching out to startup founders and execs about their experiences with their attorneys. our goal is to identify the leading lights of the industry and help spark discussions around best practices. if you have an attorney you thought did a fantastic job for your startup, let us know using this short google forms survey and also spread the word. we will share the results and more in the coming weeks. stray thoughts (aka, what i am reading) short summaries and analysis of important news stories why gutenberg can still recognize the book craig mod wrote a compelling piece in wired on the future of the book, and why today’s books essentially look the same as when the printing press was first invented. despite the prognosticators expecting books to have moving pictures, interactivity, and dynamic narratives, almost nothing in that direction has actually occurred as readers continue to enjoy the traditional format. instead, where the real innovation has taken place is on the business side, where new models from crowdfunding to email subscriptions have transformed the economics of book publishing. automattic’s newspack to drive revenue for smaller publishers while content management systems have been around for decades, almost none of these systems are designed to create revenues for their users out of the box. wordpress doesn’t have any subscription features or advertising networks built-in, which means that sites that want to make money have to spend a lot of dollars just to get setup and started. so the announcement this morning that automattic, the owner of wordpress.com, is going to offer a new platform combining content management with revenue called newspack is both interesting and definitely needed. it’s a proper extension of their existing platform, and a reminder for product managers that the sustainability of their customers is critical for long-term success. huawei sales executive arrested in poland we have been following huawei’s travails in the west for some time. one major point of contention is whether the company spies on behalf of the chinese government. western governments have argued that it does, but as china has repeatedly noted, they have never provided any proof. on friday in poland, a huawei executive was arrested for alleged espionage, which could provide the first public evidence of collusion between huawei and beijing. the company subsequently fired the executive and claimed that his actions were unrelated to the company. poland has since called on nato countries to remove huawei equipment from their telecommunications infrastructure. huawei equipment is widely installed in europe and european governments have so far evaded calls by the u.s. to boycott the company. as the largest telecom equipment manufacturer in the world, huawei’s response could have vast repercussions for the deployment of 5g networks. pg&e – oh boy silicon valley’s (and much of california’s) gas and electric utility is going bankrupt following massive liability claims against the utility due to its equipment sparking wildfires over the past few years. california may lead the world in innovation, but it seems to always be on the precipice of disaster when it comes to infrastructure. what’s next & obsessions i am reading the color of law by richard rothstein arman and i are interested in societal resilience startups that are targeting areas like water security, housing, infrastructure, climate change, disaster response, etc. reach out if you have ideas or companies here. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates."
"youtube will demonetize channels that promote anti-vaccination views, after a report by buzzfeed news found ads, including from health companies, running before anti-vax videos. the platform will also place a new information panel that links to the wikipedia entry on “vaccine hesitancy” before anti-vax videos. information panels (part of youtube’s efforts to combat misinformation) about the measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine had already appeared in front of anti-vaccination videos that mentioned it. in a statement to buzzfeed news, a youtube spokesperson said “we have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies. we enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them, we immediately take action and remove ads.” this is the second issue this week that highlights the shortcomings of youtube’s advertising and recommendation algorithms. buzzfeed news’ initial report on feb. 20 came as several major advertisers, including nestle and epic games, said they were pausing ads after youtube creator matt watson revealed how the platform’s recommendation algorithm was being exploited by what he described as a “soft-core pedophilia ring.” buzzfeed news found that the top search results for queries about vaccine safety were usually from legitimate sources, like hospitals, but then youtube’s up next algorithm would often recommend anti-vaccination videos. ads, which are placed by youtube’s advertising algorithm, appeared in front of many of those videos. youtube told buzzfeed news it would implement changes to its up next algorithm to prevent the spread of anti-vax videos. outbreaks of measles throughout the united states and in other countries have prompted scrutiny into the role of social media and tech companies, including facebook and google, in spreading misinformation. advertisers contacted by buzzfeed news who said they will take action to prevent their ads from running in front of anti-vax videos include nomad health, retail me not, grammarly, brilliant earth, cwcbexpo, xtivia, and solarwinds. vitacost told buzzfeed news that it had already pulled ads after the child exploitation issues became known. anto-vax channels now demonetized include vaxxed tv, larrycook333, and ihealthtube."

content forms. this is a rough draft of something new — provide your feedback directly to the author (danny at danny@techcrunch.com) if you like or hate something here. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. venture capital’s leading advocate nvca pushes for narrower restrictions on foreign investment let’s start with the most exciting subject in the world: the federal rulemaking process. last year, congress approved sweeping reforms of cfius, the committee on foreign investment in the united states, providing it with new powers, including the ability to review deals made by foreign investors for minority investments (aka the kinds of equity rounds typically received by startups). that reform has put a crimp on softbank’s vision fund, which has been trying to get around the rules, and also has led to a massive decline in the amount of chinese venture capital flowing into the valley. as the implementation of that reform meanders its way through the federal rulemaking process, one huge challenge is defining what the term “emerging technologies” means. because the purview of cfius will extend to any technology defined under that term, its definition is critically important; but there is just one problem: no one knows what the hell that phrase even is. so yesterday, the national venture capital association, the leading advocacy org for the asset class, submitted its stance on the debate. in a filing with the bureau of industry and security, the nvca argues for a relatively narrow interpretation of emerging technologies. the organization is specifically concerned about controls on technologies like ai/ml and gene editing through crispr, because these “horizontal technologies” are very under-defined and thus restrictions on investment could lead to tough challenges for many startups. for instance, startups that fall under these categories could be prevented from taking foreign investment, or sharing information with other startups. in short, it could kill american leadership in these industries. it’s an important point, but it is also part of a wider challenge — for startups and the government — that no one knows what “ai” means any more than they know what “emerging technologies” mean. every startup might have (or claims to have!) ai, and that could mean that highly restrictive rules from the bureau could apply pretty much to everyone, undermining the original intent of reform legislation. this is a process not worth paying attention to, except that if it were to go stupidly wrong (and this is dc after all), we might suddenly find that the thousands of ai startups in the valley suddenly become “definitely not ai” startups post-haste. don’t expect to ride chinese subway cars in america anytime soon (except if you live in boston) america’s subway cars are widely dilapidated, as riders in systems in boston, new york, dc and sf can attest. replacing those subway cars is a challenge, particularly because no american company manufactures them. among the largest manufacturers is the china railway rolling stock corp., which has won deals to replace some of boston’s aging subway cars. now, there is a renewed nationwide push to demand tougher cybersecurity standards on railcars as a way to prevent chinese companies from receiving these contracts. as the washington post noted this week, dc’s metro officials have rewritten its contract specifications, adding terms to require that all hardware and software go through cybersecurity verification from third-parties. further, congress itself is getting involved in the matter. per the article: both the u.s. senate and house have sought to block further chinese penetration of the transit vehicle market. each chamber has inserted language in annual transportation appropriations bills to impose a one-year ban on new purchases of mass transit rail cars or buses from chinese-owned companies if the procurement uses federal funding. the ban is not yet law, as final action has been put off until this year. cybersecurity is of course a legitimate concern, but so is lowering the cost of subway car replacements. by removing chinese bidders from this market, congress is effectively raising the price of subway car replacements for every city in the nation (and do you think they will pay for that increase?). huawei export license not renewed huawei has had a bullseye on its back for much of the last two years, and now it faces another restriction. the company hosts a research and development center in silicon valley, quaintly called futurewei, where it designs next-generation telecommunications tech. as reported in the wall street journal, the unit has recently seen its export license for some of its technologies pulled by the commerce department. that move means that futurewei won’t legally be allowed to transfer its know-how back to huawei in china. what becomes of the lab, which the journal reports has a budget of $16 million, is anyone’s guess. these little policy actions are starting to add up though. while the administration at one point pulled the entire license for zte and nearly killed it, it seems to have now fallen into a pattern of just creating enough friction in the market to make operating a chinese company in the u.s. annoying and unprofitable. which, with some deep irony, is exactly how the chinese have blocked american companies for years. okay, so what? with the massive decline of chinese investment in silicon valley and further export restrictions, it is clear that the trump administration wants to sever any link between the two countries in the technology industry. while it is still early, it is clear that they have been pretty clearly successful, no doubt helped by the retrenchment of the chinese economy as growth has slowed on the mainland. for founders in the u.s., the complications and tough choices have actually declined substantially. a certain universe of lps and vcs have left the market, and the chinese market is pretty clearly marked off-limits and is probably best ignored for the time being. the toughest questions might be around partnership deals with the likes of tencent, but those have not been as heavily targeted by authorities so far. so the china story may well disappear in the coming months as the two countries head in their own directions. share your feedback on your startup’s attorney my colleague eric eldon and i are reaching out to startup founders and execs

"early last year, linkedin co-founder and prolific venture capital investor reid hoffman called chris urmson “the henry ford of autonomous vehicles (av).” the vote of confidence and big check from hoffman, coupled with a team of deeply knowledgable av entrepreneurs, has catapulted his company, aurora innovation, squarely into “unicorn” territory. aurora, the developer of a full-stack self-driving software system for automobile manufacturers, is raising at least $500 million in equity funding at more than a $2 billion valuation in a round expected to be led by new investor sequoia capital, according to a recode report. a $500 million financing would bring aurora’s total raised to date to $596 million and would provide a 4x increase to its most recent valuation. the company, founded in 2016, raised a $90 million series a last february from hoffman’s greylock partners and index ventures . hoffman and index general partner mike volpi joined aurora’s board as part of the deal. greylock and index are aurora’s only existing investors, per pitchbook data. the young business has a lean cap table often characteristic of startup’s led by experienced entrepreneurs able to secure financing deals briskly from top vcs. aurora’s c-suite is chock-full of veteran av workers. urmson, for his part, formerly headed up the self-driving vehicles program at google, now known as waymo. chief technology officer drew bagnell was head of perception and autonomy at uber and sterling anderson, aurora’s chief product officer, directed the autopilot program at tesla from 2015 to 2016. “between these three co-founders, they have been thinking and working collectively in robotics, automation automotive products for over 40 years,” hoffman wrote in a blog post announcing aurora’s series a funding. in addition to the high-caliber of the founding team, aurora’s collaborative approach to building self-driving cars has attracted investors, too. the company has partnered with a number of automotive retailers to integrate its technology into their vehicles and make self-driving cars a “practical reality.” currently, aurora counts volkswagen, hyundai and chinese manufacturer byton as partners.  2018 was a banner year for vc investment in u.s. autonomous vehicle startups. in total, investors poured $1.6 billion across 58 deals, nearly doubling 2017’s high of $893 million. around the world, av startups secured $3.41 billion, on par with the $3.48 billion invested in 2017, per pitchbook. though we are just days into 2019, lidar technology developer aeye has completed a previously announced $40 million series b. the pleasanton, calif.-headquartered company raised the funds from taiwania capital, kleiner perkins, intel capital, airbus ventures and tychee partners. and last week, sydney-based baraja, another lidar startup, brought in a $32 million series a from sequoia china, main sequence ventures’ csiro innovation fund and blackbird ventures. lidar startup aeye raises $40m series b led by the taiwanese government’s investment firm"
"the fido alliance and google today announced that android (from version 7.0 up) with the latest version of the google play services is now fido2 certified. at first glance, that sounds rather boring, but it will enable developers to write apps that use a phone’s fingerprint scanner or a fido security key to authenticate users without making them type in a password. as i’m not aware of too many people who like to type in complicated passwords that their it department makes them change every few months, that’s a big deal. developers will be able to enable password-less logins in their web and native apps. chrome, microsoft edge and firefox already fully support this feature, as does apple’s safari (but only in preview). in addition to the convenience, fido2 also promises to offer phishing-resistant security, given that this technology won’t let you authenticate on a malicious site. “google has long worked with the fido alliance and w3c to standardize fido2 protocols, which give any application the ability to move beyond password authentication while offering protection against phishing attacks,” google product manager christiaan brand. “today’s announcement of fido2 certification for android helps move this initiative forward, giving our partners and developers a standardized way to access secure keystores across devices, both in market already as well as forthcoming models, in order to build convenient biometric controls for users.” it’s worth noting that android already supported password-less authentication for native apps, but now it’ll also support these for browser logins. once you’ve set up this new authentication mechanism (and once web apps support it), your phone will store all of the cryptographic data on the device and none of the raw fingerprint data, for example, will be transferred to anybody else. the fido alliance says this new mechanism will soon enable a billion users on modern android devices to experience password-less logins. developers will have to implement support in their web and native applications, though, but that’s relatively easy. windows 10 will soon get passwordless logins with yubico’s security key"
"the growth of augmented and virtual reality applications and hardware is ushering in a new age of digital media and imaging technologies, and startups that are putting themselves at the center of that are attracting interest. techcrunch has learned and confirmed that matterport — which started out making cameras but has since diversified into a wider platform to capture, create, search and utilise 3d imagery of interior and enclosed spaces in immersive real estate, design, insurance and other b2c and b2b applications — has raised $48 million. sources tell us the money came at a pre-money valuation of around $325 million, although the company is not commenting on that. from what we understand, the funding is coming ahead of a larger growth round from existing and new investors, to tap into what they see as a big opportunity for building and providing (as a service) highly accurate 3d images of enclosed spaces. the company in december appointed a new ceo, rj pittman — who had been the chief product officer at ebay, and before that held executive roles at apple and google — to help fill out that bigger strategy. matterport had raised just under $63 million prior to this and had been valued at around $207 million, according to pitchbook estimates.this current round is coming from existing backers, which include lux capital, dcm, qualcomm ventures and more. matterport’s roots are in high-end cameras built to capture multiple images to create 3d interior imagery for a variety of applications, from interior design and real estate to gaming. changing tides in the worlds of industry and hardware have somewhat shifted its course. on the hardware side, we’ve seen a rise in the functionality of smartphone cameras, as well as a proliferation of specialised 3d cameras at lower price points. so while matterport still sells its own high-end cameras, it is also starting to work with less expensive devices with spherical lenses — such as the ricoh theta, which is nearly 10 times less expensive than matterport’s pro2 camera — and smartphones. using an ai engine — which it has been building for some time — packaged into a service it calls matterport cloud 3.0, it converts 2d panoramic and 360-degree images into 3d images. (matterport cloud 3.0 is currently in beta and will be launching fully on the 18th of march, initially supporting the ricoh theta v, the theta z1, the insta360 one x and the leica geosystems blk360 laser scanner.) matterport is further using this technology to grow its wider database of images. it already has racked up 1.6 million 3d images and millions of 2d images, and at its current growth rate, the aim is to expand its library to 100 million in the coming years, positioning it as a getty for 3d enclosed images. these, in turn, will be used in two ways: to feed matterport’s machine learning to train it to create better and faster 3d images; and to become part of a wider library, accessible to other businesses by way of a set of apis. and, from what i understand, the object will not just be to use images as they are: people would be able to manipulate the images to, for example, remove all the furniture in a room and re-stage it completely without needing to physically do that work ahead of listing a house for sale. another is adding immersive interior shots into mapping applications like google’s street view. “we are a data company,” pittman told me when i met him for coffee last month. the ability to convert 2d into 3d images using artificial intelligence to help automate the process is a potentially big area that matterport, and its investors, believe will be in increasing demand. that’s not just because people still think there will one day be a bigger market for virtual reality headsets, which will need more interesting content, but because we as consumers already have come to expect more realistic and immersive experiences today, even when viewing things on regular screens — and because b2b and enterprise services (for example design or insurance applications) have also grown in sophistication and now require these kinds of images. (that demand is driving the creation of other kinds of 3d imaging startups, too. threedy.ai launched last week with a seed round from a number of angels and vcs to perform a similar kind of 2d-to-3d mapping technique for objects rather than interior spaces. it is already working with a number of e-commerce sites to bypass some of the costs and inefficiencies of more established, manual methods of 3d rendering.) while matterport is doubling down on its cloud services strategy, it also has been making some hires to take the business to its next steps. in addition to pittman, they have added dave lippman, formerly design head at ebay, as its chief design officer; and engineering veteran lou marzano as its vp of hardware, r&d and manufacturing, with more hires to come."
"alison johnston didn’t plan to build a startup around death. an early employee at q&a app aardvark that was bought by google, she’d founded tutoring app instaedu and sold it to chegg. she made mass market consumer products. but then, “i had a family member who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and i thought about how she’d be remembered” she recalls. inventing the next big social app suddenly felt less consequential. “i started looking into the funeral industry and discovered that there were very few resources to support and guide families who had recently experienced a death. it was difficult to understand and compare options and prices (which were also much higher than i ever imagined), and there weren’t good tools to share information and memories with others” johnston tells me. bombarded by options and steep costs that average $9,000 per funeral in the us, families in crisis become overwhelmed. ever loved co-founder and ceo alison johnston johnston’s startup ever loved wants to provide peace of mind during the rest-in-peace process. it’s a comparison shopping and review site for funeral homes, cemeteries, caskets, urns, and headstones. it offers price guides and recommends top amazon funeral products and takes a 5 percent affiliate fee that finances ever loved’s free memorial site maker for sharing funeral details plus collecting memories and remembrances. and families can even set up fundraisers to cover their costs or support a charity. the startup took seed funding from social capital and a slew of angel investors about a year ago. now hundreds of thousands of users are visiting ever loved shopping and memorial sites each month. eventually ever loved wants to build its own marketplace of funeral services and products that takes a 10 percent cut of purchases, while also selling commerce software to funeral homes. “people don’t talk about death. it’s taboo in our society and most people don’t plan ahead at all” johnston tells me. rushing to arrange end-of-life logistics is enormously painful, and johnston believes ever loved can eliminate some of that stress. “i wanted to explore areas where fewer people in silicon valley had experience and that weren’t just for young urban professionals.” there’s a big opportunity to modernize this aging industry with a sustainable business model and empathy as an imperative. 86 percent of funeral homes are independent, johnston says, so few have the resources to build tech products. one of the few big companies in the space, the $7 billion market cap public service corporation international, has rolled up funeral homes and cemeteries but has done little to improve pricing transparency or the user experience for families in hardship. rates and reviews often aren’t available, so customers can end up overpaying for underwhelming selection. on the startup side, there’s direct competitors like funeralwise, which is focused on education and forums but lacks robust booking features or a memorial site maker. funeral360 is ever loved’s biggest rival, but ever loved’s memorial sites looked better and it had much deeper step-by-step pricing estimates and information on funeral homes. johnston wants to use revenue from end-of-life commerce to subsidize ever loved’s memorial and fundraiser features so they can stay free or cheap while generating leads and awareness for the marketplace side. but no one has hit scale and truly become wedding site the knot but for funerals. i’ve known johnston since college, and she’s always had impressive foresight for what was about to blow up. from an extremely early gig at box.com to q&a and on-demand answers with aardvark to the explosion of online education with instaedu, she’s managed to get out in front of the megatrends. and tech’s destiny to overhaul unsexy businesses is one of the biggest right now. amazon has made us expect to see prices and reviews up front, so ever loved has gathered rate estimates for about two-thirds of us funeral homes and is pulling in testimonials. you can search for 4-star+ funeral homes nearby and instantly get high-quality results. meanwhile, funeral homes can sign up to claim their page and add information. facebook popularized online event pages. but its heavy-handed prerogatives, generalist tone, and backlash can make it feel like a disrespectful place to host funeral service details. and with people leaving their hometowns, newspapers can’t spread the info properly. ever loved is purpose-built for these serious moments, makes managing invites easy, and also offers a place to collect obituaries, photos, and memories. rather than having to click through a link to a gofundme page that can be a chore, ever loved hosts fundraisers right on its memorial sites to maximize donations. that’s crucial since funerals cost more than most people have saved. ever loved only charges a processing fee and allows visitors to add an additional tip, so it’s no more expensive that popular fundraising sites. next, “the two big things are truly building out booking through our site and expanding into some of the other end of life logistics” johnstone tells me. since the funeral is just the start of the post-death process, ever loved is well positioned to move into estate planning. “there are literally dozens of things you have to do after someone passes away — contacting the social security office, closing out bank accounts and facebook profiles…” johnston reveals that 44 percent of families say they had arguments while divvying up assets — a process that takes an average of 560 hours aka 3 months of full-time work. as the baby boomer era ends over the next 30 years, $30 trillion in assets are expected to transfer through estates, she claims. earning a tiny cut of that by giving mourners tools outlining popular ways to divide estates could alleviate disagreements could make ever loved quite lucrative. “when i first started out, i was pretty awkward about telling people about this. we’re death averse, and that hinders us in a lot of ways” johnston concludes. my own family struggled with this, as an unwillingness to accept mortality kept my grandparents from planning for after they were gone. “but i quickly learned was this was a huge conversation starter rather than a turn off. this is a topic people want to talk about more and educate themselves more on. tech too often merely makes life and work easier for those who already have it good. tech that tempers tragedy is a welcome evolution for silicon valley.”"
"in an update to the chromium engine, which underpins google’s popular chrome browser, the search giant has quietly updated the lists of default search engines it offers per market — expanding the choice of search product users can pick from in markets around the world. most notably it has expanded search engine lists to include pro-privacy rivals in more than 60 markets globally. the changes, which appear to have been pushed out with the chromium 73 stable release yesterday, come at a time when google is facing rising privacy and antitrust scrutiny and accusations of market distorting behavior at home and abroad. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook many governments are now actively questioning how competition policy needs to be updated to rein in platform power and help smaller technology innovators get out from under the tech giant shadow. but in a note about the changes to chromium’s default search engine lists on an github instance, google software engineer orin jaworski merely writes that the list of search engine references per country is being “completely replaced based on new usage statistics” from “recently collected data.” the per country search engine choices appear to loosely line up with top-four market share. the greatest beneficiary of the update appears to be pro-privacy google rival, duckduckgo, which is now being offered as an option in more than 60 markets, per the github instance. previously ddg was not offered as an option at all. another pro-privacy search rivals, french search engine qwant, has also been added as a new option — though only in its home market, france. ddg has been added in argentina, austria, australia, belgium, brunei, bolivia, brazil, belize, canada, chile, colombia, costa rica, croatia, germany, denmark, dominican republic, ecuador, faroe islands, finland, greece, guatemala, honduras, hungary, indonesia, ireland, india, iceland, italy, jamaica, kuwait, lebanon, liechtenstein, luxembourg, monaco, moldova, macedonia, mexico, nicaragua, netherlands, norway, new zealand, panama, peru, philippines, poland, puerto rico, portugal, paraguay, romania, serbia, sweden, slovenia, slovakia, el salvador, trinidad and tobago, south africa, switzerland, u.k., uruguay, u.s. and venezuela. “we’re glad that google has recognized the importance of offering consumers a private search option,” duckduckgo founder gabe weinberg told us when approached for comment about the change. ddg has been growing steadily for years, and has also recently taken outside investment to scale its efforts to capitalize on growing international appetite for pro-privacy products. interestingly, the chromium github instance is dated december 2018 — which appears to be around the time when google (finally) passed the duck.com domain to duckduckgo, after holding onto the domain and pointing it to google.com for years. we asked google for comment on the timing of its changes to search engine options in chromium. at the time of writing the search giant had not responded. reached for comment on being added as an option in its home market, qwant co-founder eric leandri said “thank you” to google for adding the search engine as an option in france, claiming “certainly it’s because of the number of users of qwant” in its home market. but he added that qwant still recommends to its users that they use mozilla’s firefox browser or the pro-privacy brave browser. he also said it would have been nicer if google had also added qwant in germany and italy where he said the search engine also has a following. asked whether he believes expanded search engine options in chrome will be enough to stave off further regulatory intervention related to google’s market dominance, leandri said no — pointing out that android oems still have to pay google to install a non-google search engine by default, following the european commission’s android antitrust ruling last year, as we’ve reported previously. “it’s a joke,” he added. “but thank you again for chrome 73, i really and sincerely appreciate [it]. i still recommend firefox and brave.” this report was updated with comment from qwant"
"google has shared its cloud revenue exactly once over the last several years. silence tends to lead to speculation to fill the information vacuum. luckily there are some analyst firms who try to fill the void, and it looks like google’s cloud business is actually trending in the right direction, even if they aren’t willing to tell us an exact number. when google last reported its cloud revenue, last year about this time, they indicated they had earned $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, which included google cloud platform and g suite combined. diane greene, who was head of google cloud at the time, called it an “elite business.” but in reality it was pretty small potatoes compared to microsoft’s and amazon’s cloud numbers, which were pulling in $4-$5 billion a quarter between them at the time. google was looking at a $4 billion run rate for the entire year. google apparently didn’t like the reaction it got from that disclosure so it stopped talking about cloud revenue. yesterday when google’s parent company, alphabet, issued its quarterly earnings report, to nobody’s surprise, it failed to report cloud revenue yet again, at least not directly. google’s diane greene says billion-dollar cloud revenue already puts them in elite company google ceo sundar pichai gave some hints, but never revealed an exact number. instead he talked in vague terms calling google cloud “a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business.” the only time he came close to talking about actual revenue was when he said, “last year, we more than doubled both the number of google cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. we also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution, g suite.” ok, it’s not an actual dollar figure, but it’s a sense that the company is actually moving the needle in the cloud business. a bit later in the call, cfo ruth porat threw in this cloud revenue nugget. “we are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. at this point, not updating further.” she is not updating further. got it. former oracle exec thomas kurian to replace diane greene as head of google cloud that brings us to a company that guessed for us, canalys. while the firm didn’t share its methodology, it did come up with a figure of $2.2 billion for the quarter. given that the company is closing larger deals and was at a billion last year, this figure feels like it’s probably in the right ballpark, but of course it’s not from the horse’s mouth, so we can’t know for certain. it’s worth noting that canalys told techcrunch that this is for gcp revenue only, and does not include g suite, so that would suggest that it could be gaining some momentum. frankly, i’m a little baffled why alphabet’s shareholders actually let the company get away with this complete lack of transparency. it seems like people would want to know exactly what they are making on that crucial part of the business, wouldn’t you? as a cloud market watcher, i know i would, and if the company is truly beginning to pick up steam, as canalys data suggests, the lack of openness is even more surprising. maybe next quarter. google in the cloud"
"rackspace, the hosted private cloud vendor, let go around 200 workers or 3 percent of its worldwide workforce of 6,600 employees this week. the company says that it’s part of a recalibration where it is trying to find workers who are better suited to their current business approach. a rackspace spokesperson told techcrunch that it is “a stable and profitable company.” in fact, it hired 1,500 employees in 2018 and currently has 200 job openings. “we continue to invest in our business based on market opportunity and our customers’ needs – we take actions on an ongoing basis in some areas where we are over-invested and hire in areas where we are under invested,” a company spokesperson explained. the company, which went public in 2008 and private again for $4.3 billion in 2016, has struggled in a cloud market dominated by giants like amazon, microsoft and google, but according to synergy research, a firm that keeps close watch on the cloud market, it is one of the top three companies in the hosted private cloud category. it’s worth noting that the top company in this category is ibm, and rackspace could be a good target for big blue if it wanted to use its checkbook to get a boost in market share. ibm is in third or fourth place in the cloud infrastructure market, depending on whose numbers you look at, but it could move the needle a bit by buying a company like rackspace. neither company is suggesting this, however, and ibm bought red hat at the end of last year for $34 billion, making it less likely it will be in a spending mood this year. for now the layoffs appear to be a company tweaking its workforce to meet current market conditions, but whatever the reason, it’s never a happy day when people lose their jobs. rackspace to go private after $4.3b acquisition by private equity firm apollo"
"despite all of the vr over-hyping, for those observing from the inside, the capabilities are still uncharted. vr as a creative medium has probably been one of the more entrancing use cases since the first high-end headsets launched. products like google’s tilt brush isolated impossible use cases, where vr was the only way to experience that act of creating something mesmerizing from nothing. massless has been intrigued by the potential of vr as a way to achieve new precision and more seamlessly shove designers and engineers into their digital workshops. the product they’re working on, the massless pen, is a professional stylus that functions with much of the pizzazz you’d expect from a product like the apple pencil, featuring things like surface sensing and capacitive touch, in addition to upgrades like haptic feedback. indeed, you can use the massless pen much like you would any other designer’s stylus, but things get a bit bizarre when you pick it up off the surface and manipulate the space in front of you. that’s because the startup’s product is also a tracked 6dof vr controller, which users can utilize as a tool to manipulate, edit and further create. it utilizes its own tracking system, which can be mounted below hardware trackers used for vr headsets. “i think the most important thing about this product is that it works in three-dimensions, but you don’t have to use vr,” ceo jack cohen tells techcrunch. “you can just use it as a standard graphics tablet and you can use it to control 3d software on a monitor… this is a transitional period for everyone, so it’s good to have that bridge that goes between them.” while a lot of digital ink has been spilled on bringing vr to consumer markets, massless plans to aim this device firmly at business customers, hoping to attract further attention from customers working in design and visualization-heavy enterprises like commercial architecture and automotive design. the plights of a hardware startup are well-documented; that’s further true of a vr team. massless has closed a seed raise of $2 million led by founders fund pathfinder to get things started. entrepreneur first, vivi nevo, shrug capital and wendy tan-white also participated in the round. the company is using the new funding to grow its team and finish the massless pen and bring it to its first set of production enterprise partners."
"amazon will stop forbidding third-party merchants who list on its e-commerce platform in the united states from selling the same products on other sites for lower prices, reports axios. the company’s decision to end its price parity provision comes three months after sen. richard blumenthal urged the department of justice to open an antitrust investigation into amazon’s policies and a few days after democratic presidential candidate sen. elizabeth warren announced she would make breaking up amazon, google and facebook a big part of her campaign platform. also called “most favored nation” (mfn) requirements, amazon’s price parity provisions gave it a competitive edge, but because of its size, also led to concerns about its impact on competition and fair pricing for consumers. amazon stopped requiring price parity of its european union sellers in 2013 after it was the subject of investigations by the united kingdom’s office of fair trading and germany’s federal cartel office. in a statement, blumenthal said amazon’s “wise and welcome decision comes only after aggressive advocacy and attention that compelled amazon to abandon its abusive contract clause.” he added that “i remain deeply troubled that federal regulators responsible for cracking down on anti-competitive practices seem asleep at the wheel, at great cost to american innovation and consumers.” techcrunch has contacted amazon for comment."
"after strong results from facebook and snap this quarter, all eyes were on twitter to see if the other big, publicly listed social network could deliver a hat trick of growth. if we judged the company on financials alone, twitter did not disappoint. the company reported q4 revenues of $909 million (up 24 percent on a year ago) and diluted earnings per share of $0.33 with a net income of $244 million. on average, analysts had been expecting revenues of $859.5 million on an eps of $0.25. however, twitter’s achilles heel remains user growth. it has now slumped to 321 million monthly active users, falling short even of estimates that were expecting a decline. shares are equally slumping in pre-market trading, down more than seven percent so far. the overall picture may have also not been helped by weak guidance. the company said it expects q1 revenues to be between just $715 million and $775 million, with operating income between $5 million and $35 million. even with q1 seasonal declines, this is a big drop from q4, also a jump up on financials from a year ago. twitter estimated that capex for 2019 would be between $550 million and $600 million, which makes one wonder if it has some acquisitions in mind, too. twitter’s q4 maus are a decrease of 9 million year-over-year and a down 5 million on last quarter with declines both in the us as well as international markets. twitter said the decline was partly due to three areas: “product changes that reduced the number of email notifications sent, as well as decisions we have made to prioritize the health of the service and not move to paid sms carrier relationships in certain markets, and, to a lesser extent, changes we made to comply with the general data protection regulation (gdpr) in europe.” the company will stop giving mau numbers after the next quarter, which is one way of shifting the ongoing decline out of the forefront of the conversation. advertising revenues were $791 million, accounting for 87 percent of the company’s revenues (more on these below). “monetizeable daily active users” are now at 126 million up from 124 million in the previous quarter. to put user growth into some context, twitter has long-standing issues with user growth that even predate the company going public. in many quarters — such as last quarter, when it also beat estimates on revenues of $758 million and earnings per share of 21 cents; and a year ago, when it also crushed financials but fell on subscriber growth — user numbers, specifically monthly active users, have remained flat or even shrunk. (even analysts factor in declines in their own estimates. they had been expecting 324 million monthly active users in q4, according to a poll from bloomberg, down from 326 million in q3.) some of twitter’s challenges on the user-number front have included the fact that despite its almost addictive popularity with some people, a strong showing from very high profile figures “speaking to the people” on twitter, and the fact that it’s become a go-to for the media both to source news as well as broadcast — the real-time aspect of the feed lends itself well to all of these — it has been hard for it to find that groove with everyone. especially for many later adopting, newer users twitter has proven to be confusing or too much work to use. that’s led to the company regularly tweaking the service to try to make it more user-friendly, with the latest move being that the company is planning a “beta” app to run multiple experiments simultaneously on a live audience receptive to seeing those and giving feedback. as with snap’s snapchat, twitter has worked to mitigate those numbers another way, too: by focusing and asking others to focus on daily active over monthly active users. that will become an official policy soon: after q1 it will stop giving out mau numbers at all. so why do user numbers ultimately matter? the general thinking goes that, in a business based around advertising and user data, as twitter is, the larger audience you have the more revenue you can make off them as a product — a turn that google and facebook have made to great effect. so it’s interesting that despite twitter’s issues with user growth, the company has been coming up trumps (sorry) with its business model, specifically initiatives around advertising and marketing and figuring out more clever ways of targeting those who are on there. its ad revenues were up 23 percent, and twitter said that new formats around video media are in particular showing strong results. video accounted for more than half of twitter’s ad revenues in the quarter and for all of 2018. for any ad-based business — and any investor or analyst of those ad-based businesses — a focus not on volume but on the quality of the audience is an interesting trend and it will be interesting to continue watching how that develops longer term, even if it’s not a trend that’s particularly benefitting twitter’s own share price at the moment. less strong this quarter were the company’s various enterprise efforts. the company said that data licensing and other revenue totalled $117 million, an increase of 35 percent but still a small proportion of overall revenues.  facebook’s strong results this quarter came at the same time that the company has been weathering a ton of bad publicity around how its platform has been exploited (seemingly with little resistance from facebook) to manipulate democratic processes, and how facebook itself has been exploiting users to extract more data to help it build products. the fact that one (financials) do not seem to be impacted by the other (bad pr) raises a lot of questions: does the public really not care about all these things, or will the commercial ramifications come down the line as a delayed reaction? it’s not clear how it will play out, but regardless, facebook has been taking measures to try to set things aright, both in terms of hiring more people to “fix” some of these issues, and also to reorient its whole staff to prioritise cleaning up the platform both when planning for future products, and in their daily work. i mention all this because twitter dedicated some time in its earnings to highlighting how it has been battling abuse. this has been one of the company’s biggest points of criticism from users, both as observers and as first-hand recipients of harassment. twitter noted that there has been a 16 percent year-over-year decrease in abuse reports. and it highlighted how it has improved security, updated rules for hateful conduct, and ramped up monitoring “behavior-based signals” to better manage what tweets are viewed.  as with facebook, it’s really not clear yet how this effort, or the frustrating and dangerous presence of trolls, will longer-term have an impact on the company’s bottom line, but we at least have one proof point of the negative impact: it has apparently affected how twitter was viewed once as an acquisition target. more generally, unless you are a ruthless monster, there is an argument to be made to fix it regardless, because that is just the right thing to do. and that is what twitter is trying to do. it said that it will also focus on this in 2019, with a “more proactive approach to reducing abuse and its effects on twitter, with the goal of reducing the burden on victims of abuse and, where possible, taking action before abuse is reported.” specifically, it said it would focus on abuse that could cause severe or immediate harm; and a better sign-up process to screen for bad actors.” twitter noted that revenue for 2018 exceeded $3 billion, up 25 percent (24 percent on a constant currency basis). it noted that tellapart contributed $45 million of revenue in the first three quarters of 2017 but was “fully deprecated” in q4’17, total revenue grew 27%. it also noted that 2018 was the company’s first year of gaap profitability, with net income of $1.2 billion, representing a net margin of 40 percent."
"the founder of korea’s nexon, one of the biggest gaming companies on the planet, today appeared to acknowledge his intention to sell his controlling interest for around $9 billion. the divestment has been a hot rumor after a report from newspaper korea economic daily this week [via reuters] suggested that jung-ju kim, who founded nexon back in 1989, is moving to sell nearly all of his holdings in the firm, which is listed on the tokyo stock exchange. kim, the paper claimed, is tired of the ups and downs of the industry and, fresh from overturning a bribery charge last year, is ready to channel his energies into new areas. in a statement released today, kim said he is “contemplating various ways to back up nexon in becoming a more globally competitive firm” while also assessing “new challenges, without growing complacent.” more information will be announced soon, kim added. nexon provided techcrunch with a copy of the statement in korean — you can read it on google translate here — while the company also issued a relative “no comment” of its own. there have been several media reports in connection with a potential transaction by nexon co., ltd. (“nexon”)’s major shareholder, nxc corporation (“nxc”), or its shareholders. none of these reports are based on any releases made by nexon. while it may be true that nxc or its shareholders are considering various options about their asset management/transactions, nothing has been decided. if a decision is made by nxc or any other relevant parties, nexon will make a release or disclosure in a timely manner. nexon went public in tokyo in 2011, raising more than $1 billion in the year’s biggest listing. kim’s holdings, which he shares with his wife, are in nxc, which is the biggest backer of nexon. already, games giants tencent and ea have been linked with a bid for the shareholding. korean media reports suggest that deutsche bank and morgan stanley have been enlisted to manage the sale. nexon specializes in free-to-play games. initially, its focus was on the pc but it has extended its reach into mobile in recent years. some of its most popular titles include maplestory, vindictus and dungeon and fighter. in its most recent financial report in november, nexon made a net profit of 22.3 billion jpy ($206.5 million) on total revenue of 69.3 billion jpy ($641.7 million), that was up 14 percent and 15 percent year-on-year, respectively. korea is the company’s biggest market by revenue, followed by north america, japan and china. the company is also active in areas outside of gaming, including crypto, where its subsidiaries have made acquisitions, and it is an investor, too. its most recent deal was an uncharacteristic early investment in embark studios, an ambitious new gaming venture from former ea executive patrick söderlund."
"last july, at its cloud next conference, google announced the cloud services platform, its first real foray into bringing its own cloud services into the enterprise data center as a managed service. today, the cloud services platform (csp) is launching into beta. it’s important to note that the csp isn’t — at least for the time being — google’s way of bringing all of its cloud-based developer services to the on-premises data center. in other words, this is a very different project from something like microsoft’s azure stack. instead, the focus is on the google kubernetes engine, which allows enterprises to then run their applications in both their own data centers and on virtually any cloud platform that supports containers.as google cloud engineering director chen goldberg told me, the idea here it to help enterprises innovate and modernize. “clearly, everybody is very excited about cloud computing, on-demand compute and managed services, but customers have recognized that the move is not that easy,” she said and noted that the vast majority of enterprises are adopting a hybrid approach. and while containers are obviously still a very new technology, she feels good about this bet on the technology because most enterprises are already adopting containers and kubernetes — and they are doing so at exactly the same time as they are adopting cloud and especially hybrid clouds. it’s important to note that csp is a managed platform. google handles all of the heavy lifting like upgrades and security patches. and for enterprises that need an easy way to install some of the most popular applications, the platform also supports kubernetes applications from the gcp marketplace. as for the tech itself, goldberg stressed that this isn’t just about kubernetes. the service also uses istio, for example, the increasingly popular service mesh that makes it easier for enterprises to secure and control the flow of traffic and api calls between its applications. with today’s release, google is also launching its new csp config management tool to help users create multi-cluster policies and set up and enforce access controls, resource quotas and more. csp also integrates with google’s stackdriver monitoring service and continuous delivery platforms. “on-prem is not easy,” goldberg said, and given that this is the first time the company is really supporting software in a data center that is not its own, that’s probably an understatement. but google also decided that it didn’t want to force users into a specific set of hardware specifications like azure stack does, for example. instead, csp sits on top of vmware’s vsphere server virtualization platform, which most enterprises already use in their data centers anyway. that surely simplifies things, given that this is a very well-understood platform. google cloud goes all-in on hybrid with its new cloud services platform"
"beatrice fihn contributor share on twitter beatrice fihn is the executive director of the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and the winner of the 2017 nobel peace prize. “atomic bombs are primarily a means for the ruthless annihilation of cities.” those are the words of leo szilard, one of the scientists who pushed for the development of nuclear weapons. he wrote them as part of a petition signed by dozens of other scientists who had worked on the manhattan project pleading with president harry truman not to use the nuclear bomb on japan. mere months after its introduction in 1945, the architects of today’s nuclear world feared the implications of the technology they had created. nearly 75 years later it’s time again to ask technologists, innovators, entrepreneurs and academics: will you be party to the ‘ruthless annihilation of cities’? will you expend your talents in the service of nuclear weapons? will you use technology to create or to destroy? our moment of choice humanity is at another turning point. a new nuclear arms race has begun in earnest with the us and russia leading the way; tearing up the promise of lasting peace in favor of a new cold war. russia’s latest weapon is built to destroy entire coast lines with a radioactive tsunami. the us is building new nuclear weapons that are ‘more likely to be used’. meanwhile, north korea appears to again be building its nascent nuclear weapons program. and india and pakistan stand on the verge of open nuclear conflict, which climate modeling shows could lead to a global famine killing upwards of 2 billion people. an indian student wearing a mask poses with her hands painted with a slogans for peace during a rally to mark hiroshima day, in mumbai on august 6, 2018. (punit paranjpe/afp/getty images) how do we stop this march toward oblivion? the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons has created an opening — a chance to radically change course with the power of international law and shifting norms. the nuclear ban treaty will become international law once 50 nations have ratified it. we are already at 22. the financial world is also recognizing the risk, with some of the world’s biggest pension funds divesting from nuclear weapons. but there is something even more powerful than the almighty dollar; human capital. “it took innovation, technological disruption, and ingenuity to create the nuclear dawn. we will need those same forces in greater measure to bring about a nuclear dusk.” the nuclear weapons industrial complex relies on the most talented scientists, engineers, physicists and technologists to build this deadly arsenal. as more of that talent moves into the tech sector, defense contractors and the pentagon is seeking to work with major technology companies and disruptive startups, as well as continue their work with universities. without those talented technologists, there would be no new nuclear arms race. it’s time to divest human capital from nuclear weapons. a mistake to end humanity? just over one year ago hawaiians took cover and frantically googled, “what to do during a nuclear attack”. days later many japanese mobile phone users also received a false alert for an inbound nuclear missile. the combination of human error and technological flaws these incidents exposed makes accidental nuclear attacks an inevitability if we don’t move to end nuclear weapons before they end us. the development of new machine learning technologies, autonomous weapons systems, cyber threats and social media manipulation are already destabilizing the global political order and potentially increasing the risk of a nuclear cataclysm. that is why it’s vital that the technology community collectively commits to using their skills and knowledge to protect us from nuclear eradication by joining the effort for global nuclear abolition. a mock “killer robot” is pictured in central london on april 23, 2013 during the launching of the campaign to stop “killer robots,” which calls for the ban of lethal robot weapons that would be able to select and attack targets without any human intervention. the campaign to stop killer robots calls for a pre-emptive and comprehensive ban on the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons. (photo: carl court/afp/getty images) we need to stop this foolish nuclear escalation in its tracks. our commitment must be to a nuclear weapons-free world, by disrupting the trajectory we are currently heading on. business as usual will likely end in nuclear war. it took innovation, technological disruption, and ingenuity to create the nuclear dawn. we will need those same forces in greater measure to bring about a nuclear dusk — the complete disarmament of nuclear-armed states and safeguards against future proliferation. the belief that we can keep doing what we have done for seven decades for another seven decades is naive. it relies on a fanciful, misplaced faith in the illogical idea of deterrence. we are told simultaneously that nuclear weapons keep the world safe, by never being used. they bestow power, but only make certain states powerful. this fallacy has been exposed by this moment in time. thirty years after the end of the cold war, nuclear weapons have proliferated. key treaties have been torn up or are under threat. and even more states are threatening to develop nuclear weapons. so i am putting out a call to you: join us with this necessary disruption; declare that you will not have a hand in our demise; declare that you will use technology for good."
"it looks like facebook was not the only one abusing apple’s system for distributing employee-only apps to sidestep the app store and collect extensive data on users. google has been running an app called screenwise meter, which bears a strong resemblance to the app distributed by facebook research that has now been barred by apple, techcrunch has learned. in its app, google invites users aged 18 and up (or 13 if part of a family group) to download the app by way of a special code and registration process using an enterprise certificate. that’s the same type of policy violation that led apple to shut down facebook’s similar research vpn ios app, which had the knock-on effect of also disabling usage of facebook’s legitimate employee-only apps — which run on the same facebook enterprise certificate — and making facebook look very iffy in the process. google’s screenwise meter app for iphones (images: google) after we asked google whether its app violated apple policy, google announced it will remove screenwise meter from apple’s enterprise certificate program and disable it on ios devices. the company said in a statement to techcrunch: “the screenwise meter ios app should not have operated under apple’s developer enterprise program — this was a mistake, and we apologize. we have disabled this app on ios devices. this app is completely voluntary and always has been. we’ve been upfront with users about the way we use their data in this app, we have no access to encrypted data in apps and on devices, and users can opt out of the program at any time.” screen(un)wise first launched in 2012, screenwise lets users earn gift cards for sideloading an enterprise certificate-based vpn app that allows google to monitor and analyze their traffic and data. google has rebranded the program as part of the cross media panel and google opinion rewards programs that reward users for installing tracking systems on their mobile phone, pc web browser, router and tv. in fact, google actually sends participants a special router that it can monitor. originally, screenwise was open to users as young as 13, just like facebook’s research app that’s now been shut down on ios but remains on android. now, according to the site’s panelist eligibility rules, google requires the primary users of its opinion rewards to be 18 or older, but still allows secondary panelists as young as 13 in the same household to join the program and have their devices tracked, as demonstrated in this video below (which was created in august of last year, underscoring that the program is still active). unlike facebook, google is much more upfront about how its research data collection programs work, what’s collected and that it’s directly involved. it also gives users the option of “guest mode” for when they don’t want traffic monitored, or someone younger than 13 is using the device. putting the not-insignificant issues of privacy aside — in short, many people lured by financial rewards may not fully take in what it means to have a company fully monitoring all your screen-based activity — and the implications of what extent tech businesses are willing to go to to amass more data about users to get an edge on competitors, google screenwise meter for ios appears to violate apple’s policy. this states, in essence, that the enterprise certificate program for distributing apps without the app store or apple’s oversight is only for internal employee-only apps. google walks users through how to install the enterprise certificate and vpn on their phone. developers seeking to do external testing on ios are supposed to use the testflight system that sees apps reviewed and limits their distribution to 10,000 people. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data we’ve yet to hear back from apple, but google moving quickly to cancel its ios screenwise meter might save it from further punishment. we’ll see if apple still invalidates the certifications for all of google’s legitimate employee-only apps that run using the same certificate the way it did to facebook. that would throw a wrench into google’s product development and daily work flow that could be more damaging than just removing one way it gathers competitive intelligence. but rather than taking seven hours to respond as backlash swelled like facebook, google managed to get things sorted in a little under three. we’ve updated this post throughout in response to google’s statement that it will shut down the ios version of screenwise meter. facebook’s vpn app puts spotlight on kids’ consent"
"the story we’re used to hearing is that women get paid less than men. in google’s case, according to its own internal pay audit, it turned out male-identified level 4 software engineers received less money than women in that same role. that led to google paying $9.7 million to adjust pay for 10,677 employees. it’s not clear how many of the employees who received pay adjustments were men (techcrunch reached out to google about this, but the company declined to share any additional data), but google does cite the underpaying of men as a reason why the company paid more in adjustments for 2018 than in 2017. but the new york times reports men received a disproportionately higher percentage of the money. for 2017, google paid just $270,000 to close any wage gaps for 228 employees across six job groups. google also cited its new-hire analysis as a reason why the company had to make more adjustments. the analysis, which entailed looking for discrepancies in offers to new hires, accounted for 49 of the total amount spent on adjustments.  “our pay equity analysis ensures that compensation is fair for employees in the same job, at the same level, location and performance,” google lead analyst for pay equity and people analytics lauren barbato wrote in a blog post. “but we know that’s only part of the story. because leveling, performance ratings, and promotion impact pay, this year, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of these processes to make sure the outcomes are fair and equitable for all employees.” meanwhile, google is still battling a class-action pay discrimination lawsuit and is the subject of a labor department investigation pertaining to compensation data."
"today, ipo-bound lyft is announcing monica poindexter, formerly facebook’s global head of diversity business partners, has joined the company to lead the transportation company’s inclusion and diversity efforts. the company has employed a head of diversity and inclusion before, but this time, the person in this role has a more holistic mission. “i’m in a unique role and have an opportunity to help the organization look at diversity more holistically and look at it through the lens of talent, workforce and marketplace,” poindexter told techcrunch. “i’m taking the time to understand the processes internally and identify areas where we can intentionally embed inclusion and diversity into our processes.” while poindexter will report to lyft vp of talent and inclusion nilka thomas, what ultimately led poindexter to take the job at lyft was her sense of commitment from lyft’s co-founders, john zimmer and logan green. “i interviewed with john and logan and was also interviewing them about commitment from the leadership team,” poindexter said. “that was a key deciding factor. i think that this work is difficult enough and you do want to be sure that you have the top-down support from leadership and are open and willing to learn but also to evolve.” lyft brought on tariq meyers to serve as its first-ever head of inclusion and diversity back in september 2016. within his first year on the job, lyft released its first diversity report, which showed numbers comparable to the likes of uber, facebook and google. meyers left lyft in april 2018 to serve as coinbase’s global head of belonging, inclusion and employee experience. last september, lyft unveiled its second annual diversity report, which showed little change from the year prior. at the time, 40 percent of lyft’s workforce identified as female while 52 percent of its employees were white."
"welcome back to transportation weekly; i’m your host kirsten korosec, senior transportation reporter at techcrunch . this is the fifth edition of our newsletter and we love the reader feedback. keep it coming. never heard of techcrunch’s transportation weekly? catch up here, here and here. as i’ve written before, consider this a soft launch. follow me on twitter @kirstenkorosec to ensure you see it each week. (an email subscription is coming.)  this week, we explore the world of light detection and ranging sensors known as lidar, young drivers, trouble in barcelona, autonomous trucks in california, and china among other things. onm … there are oems in the automotive world. and here, (wait for it) there are onms — original news manufacturers. (cymbal clash!) this is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation lives. this week, we’re going to put on our analysis hats as we explore the world of lidar, a sensor that measures distance using laser light to generate highly accurate 3d maps of the world around the car. lidar is considered by most in the self-driving car industry (tesla ceo elon musk being one exception) a key piece of technology required to safely deploy robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. there are a lot of companies working on lidar. some counts track upwards of 70. for years now, velodyne has been the primary supplier of lidar sensors to companies developing autonomous vehicles. waymo, back when it was just the google self-driving project, even used velodyne lidar sensors until 2012. dozens of startups have sprung up with velodyne in its sights. but now waymo has changed the storyline. to catch you up: waymo announced this week that it will start selling its custom lidar sensors — the technology that was at the heart of a trade secrets lawsuit last year against uber. waymo’s entry into the market doesn’t necessarily upend other companies’ plans. waymo is going to sell its short-range lidar, called laser bear honeycomb, to companies outside of self-driving cars. it will initially target robotics, security and agricultural technology. it does put pressure on startups, particularly those with less capital or those targeting the same customer base. pitchbook ran the numbers for us to determine where the lidar industry sits at the moment. there are two stories here: there are a handful of well-capitalized startups, and we may have reached “peak” lidar. last year, there were 28 vc deals in lidar technology valued at $650 million. the number of deals was slightly lower than in 2017, but the values jumped by nearly 34 percent. the top global vc-backed lidar technology companies (by post valuation) are quanergy, velodyne (although mostly corporate backed), aurora (not self-driving company aurora innovation), ouster, and dronedeploy. the graphic below, also courtesy of pitchbook, shows the latest figures as of january 31, 2019. dig in researchers discovered that two popular car alarm systems were vulnerable to a manipulated server-side api that could be abused to take control of an alarm system’s user account and their vehicle. the companies — russian alarm maker pandora and california-based viper (or clifford in the u.k.) — have fixed the  security vulnerabilities that allowed researchers to remotely track, hijack and take control of vehicles with the alarms installed. what does this all mean? our in-house security expert and reporter zack whittaker digs in and gives us a reality check. follow him @zackwhittaker. since the first widely publicized car hack in 2015 proved hijacking and controlling a car was possible, it’s opened the door to understanding the wider threat to modern vehicles. most modern cars have internet connectivity, making their baseline surface area of attack far greater than a car that doesn’t. but the effort that goes into remotely controlling a vehicle is difficult and convoluted, and the attack — often done by chaining together a set of different vulnerabilities — can take weeks or even longer to develop. key fob or replay attacks are far more likely than, say, remote attacks over the internet or cell network. a key fob sends an “unlock” signal, a device captures that signal and replays it. by replaying it you can unlock the car. this latest car hack, featuring flawed third-party car alarms, was far easier to exploit, because the alarm systems added a weakness to the vehicles that weren’t there to begin with. carmakers, with vast financial and research resources, do a far greater job at securing their vehicles than the small companies that focus on functionality over security. for now, the bigger risk comes from third parties in the automobile space, but the carmakers can’t afford to drop their game, either. a little bird … we hear a lot. but we’re not selfish. let’s share. the california department motor vehicles is the government body that regulates autonomous vehicle testing on public roads. the job of enforcement falls to the california highway patrol. in an effort to gauge the need for more robust testing guidelines, the california highway patrol decided to hold an event at its headquarters in sacramento. eight companies working on autonomous trucking technology were invited. it was supposed to be a large event with local and state politicians in attendance. and it was supposed to validate autonomous trucking as an emerging industry. there’s just one problem: only one av trucking company is willing and able to complete this course. we hear that this av startup actually already went ahead and completed the test course. the california highway patrol has postponed event, for now, presumably until more companies can join. got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation?

(the figures ey provided was through november 2018.) ride-hailing companies raised $7.1 billion in 2018, a 73 percent decline from the previous year when $26.7 billion poured into this sector. investors, it seems, are shifting their focus to other business models, notably first- and last-mile connectivity. ey estimates $7 billion was invested in two-wheeler mobility companies such as bike-sharing and electric scooters in 2018. the u.s. and china together have contributed to more than 80 percent of overall two-wheeler mobility investments this year alone, according to ey research shared with techcrunch. other deals: flixbus, the german uber-like bus service, is buying rival eurolines from transdev. vayavision, an autonomous vehicle technology startup that developed perception software received a 2.45 million euro grant ($2.75 million) from the european commission’s european innovation council. the company is backed by backed by lg corp and mitsubishi ufj capital. remix picks up $15 million to help cities make better decisions around transit. hammerhead raises $4.2 million to build a better operating system for bikes. brodmann17 — named after the primary visual cortex in the human brain — raised $11 million in a series a round of funding led by ourcrowd, with participation also from maniv mobility, ai alliance, ul ventures, samsung next, and the sony innovation fund. snapshot let’s talk about generation z, that group of young people born 1996 to the present, and one startup that is focused on turning that demographic into car owners. there’s lots of talk and hand-wringing about young people choosing not to get a driver’s license, or not buying a vehicle. in the uk, for instance, about 42 percent of young drivers aged 17 to 24 hold a driver’s license. that’s about 2.7 million people, according to the national travel survey 2018 (nts) of the uk government’s department of transport. an additional 2.2 million have a provisional or learner license. combined, that amounts to about 13 percent of the car driving population of the uk. in the uk, evidence suggests that a rise in motoring costs have discouraged young people from learning. and therein lies one opportunity that a new startup called driver1 is targeting. driver 1 is a car subscription service designed exclusively for first car drivers aged 17 to 24. the company has been in stealth mode for about a year and is just now launching. “the young driver market is being underserved by the car industry,” driver1 founder tim hammond told techcrunch. “and primarily it’s the financing that’s not available for that age group. it’s also something that’s not really affordable for any of the car subscription models like fair.com, and it’s not suitable for the oem subscription services, either financially or from an age perspective for young drivers.” the company’s own research has found this group wants a newer car for 12 to 15 months. “the car is the extension of their device,” hammond said, noting these drivers don’t want the old junkers. “they want their iphones and they want the car that goes with it.” the company is working directly with leasing companies — not dealerships — to provide young drivers with 3- to 5-year-old cars that have lost 60 percent or so of their value. driver1 is targeting under $120 a month for the customer and has a partnership with remarketing company manheim, which is owned by cox automotive. the startup is focused on the uk for now and has about 600 members who have reserved their cars for purchase. driver1 is aiming to capture about 10 percent of the 1 million or so young people in the uk who pass their learners permit each year. the company plans to expand to france and other european countries in the fall. tiny but mighty micromobility ca-caw, ca-caw! that’s the sound of bird gearing up to launch bird platform in new zealand, canada and latin america in the coming weeks. the platform is part of bird’s mission to bring its scooters across the world “and empower local entrepreneurs in regions where we weren’t planning to launch to run their own electric-scooter sharing program with bird’s tech and vehicles,” bird ceo travis vanderzanden told techcrunch. mrd’s two cents: bird platform seems like a way for bird to make extra cash without having to do any of the work i.e. charging the vehicles, maintaining them and working with city officials to get permits. smart! meanwhile, the dolla dolla bills keep pouring into micromobility. european electric scooter startup voi technology raised an additional $30 million in capital. that was on top of a $50 million series a round just three months ago. oh, and because micromobility isn’t just for startups, volkswagen decided to launch a kind of weird-looking electric scooter in geneva. because, why not? — megan rose dickey one more thing … lyft is trimming staff to prepare for its ipo. techcrunch’s ingrid lunden learned that the company has laid off about 50 staff in its bike and scooter division. it appears most of these folks are people who joined the lyft through its acquisition of  electric bike sharing startup motivate, a deal that closed about three months ago. notable reads it’s probably not smart to suggest another newsletter, but if you haven’t checked out michael dunne’s  the chinese are coming newsletter, you should. dunne has a unique perspective on what’s happening in china, particularly as it relates to automotive and newer forms of mobility, such as ride-hailing. one interesting nugget from his latest edition: there are more than 20 other new electric vehicle makers in china. “most will fall away within the next 3 to 4 years as cash runs out,” dunne predicts. other quotable notables: here’s a fun read for the week. techcrunch’s lucas matney wrote about a yc combinator startup jetpack aviation.the startup has launched pre-orders this week for the moonshot of moonshots, the speeder, a personal vertical take-off and landing vehicle with a svelte concept design that looks straight out of star wars or halo. testing and deployments spanish ride-hailing firm cabify is back operating in barcelona, spain despite issuing dire warnings that new regulations issued by local government would crush its business and force it to fire thousands of drivers and leave forever. turns out forever is one month. the catalan generalitat issued a decree last month imposing a wait time of at least 15 minutes between a booking being made and a passenger being picked up. the policy was made to ensure taxis and ride-hailing firms are not competing for the same passengers, following a series of taxi strikes, which included scenes of violence. our boots on the ground reporter natasha lomas has the whole story. sure, barcelona is just one city. but what happened in barcelona isn’t an isolated incident. the early struggles between conventional taxis and ride-hailing operations might be over, but that doesn’t mean the matter has been settled altogether. and it’s not likely to go away. once robotaxis actually hit the road en masse — and yes, that’ll be awhile — these same struggles will pop up again. other deployments, or, er, retreats …. bike share pioneer mobike retreats to china on the autonomous vehicle front: china post, the official postal service of china, and delivery and logistics companies deppon express, will begin autonomous package delivery services in april. the delivery trucks will operate on autonomous driving technologies developed by fabu technology, an ai company focused on intelligent driving systems. on our radar there is a lot of transportation-related activity this month. come find me. sxsw in austin: techcrunch will be at sxsw. and there is a lot of mobility action here. aurora ceo and co-founder chris urmson was on stage saturday morning with malcolm gladwell. mayors from a number of u.s. cities as well as companies like ford and mercedes are on the scene. here’s where i’ll be.  2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. (local time) march 9 at the empire garage for the smart mobility summit, an annual event put on by wards intelligence and c3 group. the autonocast, the podcast i co-host with alex roy and ed niedermeyer, will also be on hand. 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. (local time) march 12 at the jw marriott. the autonocast and founding general partner of trucks vc, reilly brennan, will hold a sxsw podcast panel on automated vehicle terminology and other stuff. 3:30 p.m (local time) over at the hilton austin downtown, i’ll be moderating a panel re-inventing the wheel: own, rent, share, subscribe. sherrill kaplan with zipcar, amber quist, with silvercar and russell lemmer with dealerware will join me on stage. techcrunch is also hosting a sxsw party from 1 pm to 4 pm sunday, march 10, 615 red river st., that will feature musical guest elderbrook. rsvp here.  nvidia gtc techcrunch (including yours truly) will also be at nvidia’s annual gpu technology conference from march 18 to 21 in san jose. self racing cars the annual self racing car event will be held march 23 and march 24 at thunderhill raceway near willows, california. there is still room for participants to test or demo their autonomous vehicles, drive train innovation, simulation, software, teleoperation, and sensors. hobbyists are welcome. sign up to participate or drop them a line at contact@selfracingcars.com. thanks for reading. there might be content you like or something you hate. feel free to reach out to me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share those thoughts, opinions or tips.  nos vemos la próxima vez."
"many things are better said than read, but the best voice tech out there seems to be reserved for virtual assistants, not screen readers or automatically generated audiobooks. wellsaid wants to enable any creator to use quality synthetic speech instead of a human voice — perhaps even a synthetic version of themselves. there’s been a series of major advances in voice synthesis over the last couple of years as neural network technology improves on the old highly manual approach. but google, apple and amazon seem unwilling to make their great voice tech available for anything but chirps from your phone or home hub. as soon as i heard about wavenet, and later tacotron, i tried to contact the team at google to ask when they’d get to work producing natural-sounding audiobooks for everything on google books, or as a part of amp, or make it an accessibility service, and so on. never heard back. i considered this a lost opportunity, as there are many out there who need such a service. so i was pleased to hear that wellsaid is taking on this market, after a fashion, anyway. the company is the first to launch from the allen institute for ai (ai2) incubator program announced back in 2017. they do take their time! allen-backed ai2 incubator aims to connect ai startups with world-class talent talk the talk i talked with the co-founders ceo matt hocking and cto michael petrochuk, who explained why they went about creating a whole new system for voice synthesis. the basic problem, they said, is that existing systems not only rely on a lot of human annotation to sound right, but they “sound right” the exact same way every time. you can’t just feed it a few hours of audio and hope it figures out how to inflect questions or pause between list items — much of this stuff has to be spelled out for them. the end result, however, is highly efficient. “their goal is to make a small model for cheap [i.e. computationally] that pronounces things the same way every time. it’s this one perfect voice,” said petrochuk. “we took research like tacotron and pushed it even further — but we’re not trying to control speech and enforce this arbitrary structure on it.” “when you think about the human voice, what makes it natural, kind of, is the inconsistencies,” said hocking. and where better to find inconsistencies than in humans? the team worked with a handful of voice actors to record dozens of hours of audio to feed to the system. there’s no need to annotate the text with “speech markup language” to designate parts of sentences and so on, petrochuk said: “we discovered how to train off of raw audiobook data, without having to do anything on top of that.” so wellsaid’s model will often pronounce the same word differently, not because a carefully manicured manual model of language suggested it do so, but because the person whose vocal fingerprint it is imitating did so. and how does that work, exactly? that question seems to dip into wellsaid’s secret sauce. their model, like any deep learning system, is taking innumerable inputs into account and producing an output, but it is larger and more far-reaching than other voice synthesis systems. things like cadence and pronunciation aren’t specified by its overseers but extracted from the audio and modeled in real time. sounds a bit like magic, but that’s often the case when it comes to bleeding-edge ai research. it runs on a cpu in real time, not on a gpu cluster somewhere, so it can be done offline as well. this is a feat in itself, as many voice synthesis algorithms are quite resource-heavy. what matters is that the voice produced can speak any text in a very natural-sounding way. here’s the first bit of an article — alas, not one of mine, which would have employed more mellifluous circumlocutions — read by google’s wavenet, then by two of wellsaid’s voices. the latter two are definitely more natural sounding than the first. on some phrases the voices may be nearly indistinguishable from their originals, but in most cases i feel sure i could pick out the synthetic voice in a few words. that it’s even close, however, is an accomplishment. and i can certainly say that if i was going to have an article read to my by one of these voices, it would be wellsaid’s. naturally it can also be tweaked and iterated, or effects applied to further manipulate the sound, as with any voice performance. you didn’t think those interviews you hear on npr are unedited, did you? the goal at first is to find the creatives whose work would be improved or eased by adding this tool to their toolbox. “there are a lot of people who have this need,” explained hocking. “a video producer who doesn’t have the budget to hire a voice actor; someone with a large volume of content that has to be iterated on rapidly; if english is a second language, this opens up a lot of doors; and some people just don’t have a voice for radio.” it would be nice to be able to add voice with a click rather than just have block text and royalty-free music over a social ad (think the admen): i asked about the reception among voice actors, who of course are essentially being asked to train their own replacements. they said that the actors were actually positive about it, thinking of it as something like stock photography for voice; get a premade product for cheap, and if you like it, pay the creator for the real thing. although they didn’t want to prematurely lock themselves into future business models, they did acknowledge that revenue share with voice actors was a possibility. payment for virtual representations is something of a new and evolving field. a closed beta launches today, which you can sign up for at the company’s site. they’re going to be launching with five voices to start, with more voices and options to come as wellsaid’s place in the market becomes clear. part of that process will almost certainly be inclusion in tools used by the blind or otherwise disabled, as i have been hoping for years. sounds familiar and what comes after that? making synthetic versions of users’ voices, of course. no brainer! but the two founders cautioned that’s a ways off for several reasons, even though it’s very much a possibility. “right now we’re using about 20 hours of data per person, but we see a future where we can get it down to one or two hours while maintaining a premium lifelike quality to the voice,” said petrochuk. “and we can build off existing data sets, like where someone has a back catalog of content,” added hocking. the trouble is that the content may not be exactly right for training the deep learning model, which advanced as it is can no doubt be finicky. there are dials and knobs to tweak, of course, but they said that fine-tuning a voice is more a matter of adding corrective speech, perhaps having the voice actor reading a specific script that props up the sounds or cadences that need a boost. they compared it with directing such an actor rather than adjusting code. you don’t, after all, tell an actor to increase the pauses after commas by 8 percent or 15 milliseconds, whichever is longer. it’s more efficient to demonstrate for them: “say it like this.” even so, getting the quality just right with limited and imperfect training data is a challenge that will take some serious work if and when the team decides to take it on. but as some of you may have noticed, there are also some parallels to the unsavory world of “deepfakes.” download a dozen podcasts or speeches and you’ve got enough material to make a passable replica of someone’s voice, perhaps a public figure. this of course has a worrying synergy with the existing ability to fake video and other imagery. this is not news to hocking and petrochuk. if you work in ai, this kind of thing is sort of inevitable. “this is a super important question and we’ve considered it a lot,” said petrochuk. “we come from ai2, where the motto is ‘ai for the common good.’ that’s something we really subscribe to, and that differentiates us from our competitors who made barack obama voices before they even had an mvp [minimum viable product]. we’re going to watch closely to make sure this isn’t being used negatively, and we’re not launching with the ability to make a custom voice, because that would let anyone create a voice from anyone.” active monitoring is just about all anyone with a potentially troubling ai technology can be expected to do — though they are looking at mitigation techniques that could help identify synthetic voices. with the ongoing emphasis on multimedia presentation of content and advertising rather than written, wellsaid seems poised to make an early play in a growing market. as the product evolves and improves, it’s easy to picture it moving into new, more constrained spaces, like time-shifting apps (instant podcast with five voices to choose from!) and even taking over territory currently claimed by voice assistants. sounds good to me."
"it was a tough week. journalists around the u.s. were hit hard by layoffs, from huffpost to buzzfeed news to verizon media group, which owns this very site. the government entered day 35 of the shutdown before president donald trump agreed to a short-term deal to reopen it for three weeks. and in the startup world, a once high-flying, venture-subsidized food delivery startup crashed and burned, leaving a cluster of small businesses in its wreckage. some good things happened too — we’ll get to those. munchery fails to pay its debts in an email to customers on monday, munchery

"deep learning involves a highly iterative process where data scientists build models and test them on gpu-powered systems until they get something they can work with. it can be expensive and time-consuming, often taking weeks to fashion the right model. new startup determined ai wants to change that by making the process faster, cheaper and more efficient. it emerged from stealth today with $11 million in series a funding. the round was led by gv (formerly google ventures) with help from amplify partners, haystack and sv angel. the company also announced an earlier $2.6 million seed round from 2017, for a total $13.6 million raised to date. evan sparks, co-founder and ceo at determined ai, says that up until now, only the largest companies like facebook, google, apple and microsoft could set up the infrastructure and systems to produce sophisticated ai like self-driving cars and voice recognition technologies. “our view is that a big reason why [these big companies] can do that is that they all have internal software infrastructure that enables their teams of machine learning engineers and data scientists to be effective and produce applications quickly,” sparks told techcrunch. determined’s idea is to create software to handle everything from managing cluster compute resources to automating workflows, thereby putting some of that big-company technology within reach of any organization. “what we exist to do is to build that software for everyone else,” he said. the target market is fortune 500 and global 2000 companies. the company’s solution is based on research conducted over the last several years at amplab at the university of california, berkeley (which is probably best known for developing apache spark). it used the knowledge generated in the lab to build sophisticated solutions that help make better use of a customer’s gpu resources. “we are offering kind of a base layer that is scheduling and resource sharing for these highly expensive resources, and then on top of that we’ve layered some services around workflow automation.” sparks said the team has generated state of the art results that are somewhere between five and 50 times faster than the results from tools that are available to most companies today. for now, the startup is trying to help customers move away from generic kinds of solutions currently available to more customized approaches, using determined ai tools to help speed up the ai production process. the money from today’s round should help fuel growth, add engineers and continue building the solution."
"botify, a search engine optimization company that works with customers like expedia and nike, announced today that it has raised $20 million in series b funding. co-founder and ceo adrien menard said that the opportunity in seo is “even bigger now than in the past,” and that the problem is a much broader problem than many realize. “most people think about seo in terms of keyword optimization, but more than 50 percent of the pages in large websites are not being indexed,” he said. so botify can identify which pages aren’t being crawled by google and make recommendations on how to better organize content. over time, botify has also launched a keyword product, as well as tools like a javascript crawler and mobile versus desktop analysis. menard said the company now offers a platform designed for “optimization of every stage of the search process.” botify is an seo crawler that helps your website optimize for googlebot the new funding was led by france’s idinvest partners, with participation from ventech. botify has now raised a total of $27 million. the company was founded in france, launching in the united states after taking the stage at techcrunch’s disrupt ny conference in 2016. next, it’s opening what it calls a “second u.s. headquarters” in seattle (the first is in new york city), which menard said will mostly provide sales and support for west coast customers. in addition to announcing the funding and the new office, botify has also grown its leadership team, with the hiring of christophe frenet as senior vice president of product and rachel meranus as chief marketing officer, as well as the addition of neolane co-founder stephane dehoche and former buzzfeed president greg coleman to its board of directors."
"google today announced that you can now register .dev domain names. google acquired the .dev top-level domain when icann opened up the web to new generic top-level domains (gtld) a few years ago. at the time, google acquired gtld’s like .app, .page and .dev (for some reason, google also owns .soy). right now, the .dev domains are still in an early access program, though. that means you’ll have to pay an additional fee that decreases every day until february 28 — and that early access fee is pretty steep. registering a new domain on godaddy, which is one of the many resellers that offer the new domain names, will set you back over $12,500 in extra fees today. tomorrow, that price drops to just over $3,100. come february 28, you can register any available domain and it’ll just cost you about $20 per year. the idea here, of course, is to manage demand (and to extract a few extra dollars from the companies that really need to have a given domain name). some of the companies and organizations that are already using the new gtld are google itself, as well as the likes of github. women who code, jetbrains, codecademy and salesforce. and because this is 2019, there’s also kubernetes.dev. like its .app domains, .dev domains will require https connections to protect users from ad malware, tracking injections and wi-fi snooping. “we hope .dev will be a new home for you to build your communities, learn the latest tech and showcase your projects—all with a perfect domain name,” google explains in today’s announcement. i never got the sense that there was all that much demand for non-.com or country-level domain names (does the world really need .ninja domains?), but if you always wanted a .dev domain, now would be a good time to get out your credit card. google is launching .app domains, the first tlds secured with built-in https"

"sales and marketing are steeped in data to explain just how well they are doing, but engineering, the department charged with creating the products these departments sell has lacked the tools to measure engineering effectiveness. pinpoint wants to change that by making engineering a more data-driven endeavor. today it announced a $13.5 million series a round. the round was led by bessemer venture partners with participation from seed investors storm ventures, boldstart ventures, bloomberg beta, slack fund, social capital and cherubic ventures. that’s quite a lineup of investors for an early-stage startup. perhaps that’s because the company was founded by a couple of industry veterans, jeff haynie and nolan wright, who co-founded appcelerator. that company was acquired by axway in 2016. one of the issues the two founders observed running a company was the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of their engineering group, and that there were a dearth of tools to help. sure if you were facebook, google, apple or similarly large organization, maybe you could create such a product in-house, but the founders saw that engineering groups at most companies lacked a centralized, data-driven approach to understand how well the group’s efforts aligned with the broader goals of the organization. so they did what all good entrepreneurs do, they started a company to do just that. taking advantage of machine learning, the company built an application that taps into engineering tools like jira and github to manage, understand and even predict engineering outcomes. the approach doesn’t actually require engineers to do anything differently. they simply use their regular systems of organization and connect pinpoint to them to gather data. team performance graph. screenshot: pinpoint it wasn’t an easy tool to build because they needed actual data to train the machine learning models. the company used its own engineering efforts and those of several design partners to help launch the product. the founders also recognized that companies may be reluctant to move their engineering data to the cloud, so they came up with a solution, using an open source agent that sits on the customer’s systems, and only moves metadata to the cloud. pinpoint was founded in 2016. it’s based in austin and currently has 25 employees. that is likely to increase fairly dramatically as they put today’s investment to use."
"after days of demos and announcements and miles of walking, i’m confident in declaring holoride the best thing at this year’s ces. the designation of “the best thing at ces 2019” is my badging. this isn’t an official award handed out by a governing body. this is just me saying holoride is the best thing i’ve seen at the show. this year’s ces is fine, i guess. the main theme is connecting services around the smart home. there’s a huge range of devices that now support services from amazon, google and apple. ces 2019 also featured the launch of new silicon chipsets and self-driving platforms. but the thing that impressed me the most is from holoride, a startup from audi that wants to put vr in cars to entertain and reduce motion sickness. iron man needs help, rocket told me. and like that i was thrust into a space battle against thanos’ bad guys. there was an oculus on my head and my body was dipping and diving, shooting through space, while i was waving my hands around, blasting the enemy. it was straight out of disney world (partly because disney helped with the content). except i was in vegas, in the back of an audi suv hitting speeds of 90 mph on a track. after two laps around the track, i walked away fine. i didn’t feel sick at all, even though i’m the sort of person who can’t look at their phone in a car. matching the vr content to the vehicle’s movements is key to the holoride experience. in short, when the car moves, the content moves in the same way. this reduces motion sickness, and, from my demo, i can confirm it works — at least on me. the technology comes from a small startup recently spun out of audi in a play to put vr in every car. the founders have been working on the technology behind the in-car vr system for several years. the automaker holds a minority interest through subsidiary audi electronics venture, which helped develop the technology. audi will license the technology to holoride and the startup will use an open platform to allow any automaker as well as content developers to create whatever reality formats they desire. i’ve experienced countless vr experiences, and this was one of the best demos i’ve had. the use case is compelling too. not only does it provide entertainment, but it also solves motion sickness. it’s easy to imagine this in an ad-supported format in the back of an uber or while on a long-distance bus. it could work in planes too. it could improve long car rides with the kids. holoride is a longshot and there are countless questions around the content, consumer outreach and compatibility. in order for it to take off, the company needs to build an ecosystem complete with developers, auto makers and consumers. building amazing experiences is one thing; selling amazing experiences is even harder. i used vr in a car going 90 mph and didn’t get sick audi spins out holoride to put vr in every car"
"google, as well as many other companies, has long relied on wikipedia for its content. now, google and google.org are giving back. google.org president jacquelline fuller today announced a $2 million contribution to the wikimedia endowment. an additional $1.1 million donation went to the wikimedia foundation, courtesy of a campaign where google employees decided where to direct google’s donation dollars. the wikimedia foundation is the nonprofit organization behind wikipedia, while the endowment is the fund. “google and wikimedia each play a unique role in an internet that works for and reflects the diversity of its users,” the wikimedia foundation wrote in a blog post. “we look forward to continuing our work with google in close collaboration with our communities around the world.” in addition to the donation, google and wikipedia are expanding project tiger, an initiative to expand the content on wikipedia into additional languages. the pilot program has already increased the amount of locally relevant content in 12 indic languages. with the expansion, the goal is to include 10 more languages. “while efforts to empower editors will help them continue to add more information and knowledge to the web, we also aim to support the long-term health of the wikimedia projects so they are available for generations to come,” fuller wrote in a blog post. in march, google’s youtube decided to try to combat conspiracy videos with information sourced from wikipedia. at the time, wikimedia executive director katherine maher noted it’d be nice if the corporations that use wikipedia would give back. “we want people all over the world to use, share, add to, and remix wikipedia,” maher said at the time. “at the same time, we encourage companies who use wikimedia’s content to give back in the spirit of sustainability.” google has made contributions to wikimedia before — to the sum of more than $7.5 million in total. in 2010, for example, google gave a $2 million grant to the wikimedia foundation. but this is the first time google has donated to the wikimedia endowment, which supports wikimedia’s long-term success. it’s worth noting that google is not the only corporation that has given back to the wikimedia foundation. late last year, amazon, acknowledging how its alexa voice assistants rely heavily on information from wikipedia, donated $1 million to the wikimedia endowment."
"as soon as mark zuckerberg said in a lengthy 3,225-word blog post to not build data centers in countries with poor human rights, he had already broken his promise. he chose to ignore singapore, which the facebook founder had only months earlier posted about, declaring the micro-state home to the company’s first data center in asia to “serve everyone.” zuckerberg was clear: “as we build our infrastructure around the world, we’ve chosen not to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.” if there are two things singapore is known for, it’s that there’s no privacy nor freedom of expression. for all its glitz and economic power, singapore’s human rights record falls far below internationally recognized norms. the state, with a population of five million, consistently falls close to the bottom in worldwide rankings by rights groups for its oppressive laws against freedom of speech, expression and assembly and limited rights to privacy under its expanding surveillance system. worse, the country is known for its horrendous treatment of those in the lgbtq+ community, whose actions are heavily restricted and any public act or depiction is deemed criminal. and even the media are under close watch and often threatened with rebuke and defamation lawsuits by the government. reporters without borders said singapore has an “intolerant government,” and human rights watch called some of the country’s more restrictive laws “draconian.” we brought these points up to facebook, but the company doesn’t see zuckerberg’s remarks as contradictory or hypocritical. “deciding where to locate a new data center is a multi-year process that considers dozens of different factors, including access to renewable energy, connectivity, and a strong local talent pool,” said facebook spokesperson jennifer hakes. “an essential factor, however, is ensuring that we can protect any user data stored in the facility.” “this was the key point that mark zuckerberg emphasized in his post last week,” said hakes. “we looked at all these factors carefully in singapore and determined that it was the right location for our first data center in asia.” it’s ironic that facebook’s own platform has been a target for singapore’s government to crack down on vocal opponents of the state. jolovan wham, an activist, was jailed after organizing a public assembly from a facebook page. the assembly’s permit was denied, so he switched the venue to a skype call. when asked, facebook declined to comment on what it considers unacceptable human rights by a country, only referring back to zuckerberg’s post. singapore remains be an important hub for the tech industry and business — particularly for western companies, which have thrown human rights to the wind even as they tout their commitment to privacy and free speech at home. amazon, microsoft, google, digitalocean, linode and ovh all have data centers in the micro-state. but only one to date has made public commitments to not store data in countries with poor records on human rights. why has facebook made an exception for singapore? it’s a mystery to everyone but mark zuckerberg. mark zuckerberg is ‘proud’ of how facebook handled its scandals this year"
"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here: 1. facebook is the new crapware  well facebook, you did it again. fresh off its latest privacy scandal, the troubled social media giant has inked a deal with android to pre-install its app on an undisclosed number of phones and make the software permanent. this means you won’t be able to delete facebook from those phones. thanks, facebook. 2. the world’s first foldable phone is real  chinese company royole has beaten samsung to the market and has been showing off a foldable phone/tablet this week at ces. while it’s not the most fluid experience, the device definitely works at adapting to your needs. 3. ces revokes award from female-founded sex tech company outcries of a double-standard are pouring out of ces after the consumer tech association revoked an award from a company geared toward women’s sexual health. 4. everything google announced at ces 2019  google went all in on the assistant this year at ces. the company boasted that the voice-enabled ai will make its way onto a billion devices by the end of the month — up from 400 million last year. but what’s most exciting is the expanded capabilities of google’s assistant. soon you’ll be able to check into flights and translate conversations on the fly with a simple “hey google.” 5. rebranding wework won’t work  the company formerly known as wework has rebranded to the we company, but its new strategy has the potential to plunge the company further into debt. 6. despite promises to stop, us cell carriers are still selling your real-time phone location data last year a little-known company called locationsmart came under fire after leaking location data from at&t, verizon, t-mobile and sprint users to shady customers. locationsmart quickly buckled under public scrutiny and promised to stop selling user data, but few focused on another big player in the location tracking business: zumigo. 7. the best and worst of ces 2019  from monster displays to vr in cars, we’re breaking down the good, the bad and the ugly from ces 2019."
"compared to startups born into the frothy london fintech space as it exists today, 2011-founded gocardless could well be considered a slow burner. however, in more recent years, the nearly 300-person company — headed by co-founder and ceo hiroki takeuchi — has undoubtedly stepped on the gas in a bid to become the one-stop shop globally for businesses that want to let customers pay via recurring bank payments. a little over a year ago, gocardless announced that it had raised $22.5 million in further funding, off the back of record annual growth in the u.k. and strong early traction in new markets. and today the fintech is disclosing another fresh injection of capital: $75 million in series e funding, in part to fund new offices across emea, apac and north america. in addition to its london hq, the company already has sites in france, australia and germany, from which it says it processes transactions for 40,000 businesses worldwide. leading the round are new investors adams street partners, google ventures and salesforce ventures. previous backers accel partners, balderton capital, notion capital and passion capital also followed on. in a call with takeuchi late last week, he picked up on a familiar theme, describing the collection of recurring payments for many business as “broken.” accessing the various bank to bank payments schemes has traditionally been difficult from a commercial, compliance and technical point of view. instead, businesses have typically relied on payment methods, such as card payments or cheques, which aren’t up to the job of recurring payments. that’s because these payment options are designed for one-off transactions (cards, for example, expire, breaking the payment flow). meanwhile, there’s been a rise in subscription business models and an expanding b2b market in which contractors and partners need to make regular variable payments. according to takeuchi, this means an international recurring payments network like the one gocardless is building is needed more than ever. “a global network for bank debit is an absolute necessity in allowing businesses to easily collect recurring payments anywhere, in any currency,” he says. “thanks to the support of our investors we can now open up our global network and payments platform to more businesses across the world, delivering on our mission to take the pain out of getting paid, so that businesses can focus on what they do best.” takeuchi also tells me gocardless is investing heavily in its product, with a product team of around 100 members. he declined to go into much detail with regards to gocardless’ immediate or more long-term roadmap, although currency conversion is one area the company is developing new products for. it’s not clear if that will be via an fx partner, such as london neighbour transferwise, or a more homegrown solution, although the former seems more likely. takeuchi wouldn’t be drawn on any specifics. other areas of development include products to help businesses boost cash flow via “instant settlement,” and smarter payment features to increase transaction success rates. the latter could include using open banking to check if funds are available before trying to process a bank debit, or to automatically set the most appropriate payment date."
"responding to elizabeth warren’s call to regulate and break up some of the nation’s largest technology companies, the venture capitalists that invest in technology companies are advising the presidential hopeful to move slowly and not break anything. warren’s plan called for regulators to be appointed to oversee the unwinding of several acquisitions that were critical to the development of the core technology that make alphabet’s google and the social media giant facebook so profitable… and zappos. warren also wanted regulation in place that would block companies making over $25 billion that operate as social media or search platforms or marketplaces from owning companies that also sell services on those marketplaces. as a whole, venture capitalists viewing the policy were underwhelmed. “as they say on broadway, ‘you gotta have a gimmick’ and this is clearly warren’s,” says ben narasin, an investor at one of the nation’s largest investment firms,” new enterprise associates, which has $18 billion in assets under management and has invested in consumer companies like jet, an online and mobile retailer that competed with amazon and was sold to walmart for $3.3 billion. “decades ago, at the peak of japanese growth as a technology competitor on the global stage, the u.s. government sought to break up ibm . this is not a new model, and it makes no sense,” says narasin. “we slow down our country, our economy and our ability to innovate when the government becomes excessively aggressive in efforts to break up technology companies, because they see them through a prior-decades lens, when they are operating in a future decade reality. this too shall pass.” balaji sirinivasan, the chief technology officer of coinbase, took to twitter to offer his thoughts on the warren plan. “if big companies like google, facebook and amazon are prevented from acquiring startups, that actually reduces competition,” sirinivasan writes. if big companies like google, facebook, and amazon are prevented from acquiring startups, that actually reduces competition. the reason is that if there is less m&a due to legal uncertainty, there is a reduced incentive for angels & vcs to fund those startups in the first place. — balaji s. srinivasan (@balajis) march 8, 2019 a regulation that purports to reduce the power of a large company frequently ends up increasing it, by erecting barriers to entry for startups. often that barrier is licensing. in this case the barrier would be reduced access to capital. — balaji s. srinivasan (@balajis) march 8, 2019 “there are two separate issues here that are being conflated. one issue is do we need regulation on the full platform companies. and the answer is absolutely,” says venky ganesan, the managing director of menlo ventures. “these platforms have a huge impact on society at large and they have huge influence.” but while the platforms need to be regulated, ganesan says, senator warren’s approach is an exercise in overreach. “that plan is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. it’s overwhelming and it’s not commensurate with the issues,” ganesan says. “i don’t think at the end of the day venture capital is worrying about competition from these big platform companies. [and] as the proposal is composed it would create more obstacles rather than less.” using warren’s own example of the antitrust cases that were brought against companies like at&t and microsoft is a good model for how to proceed, ganesan says. “we want to have the technocrats at the ftc figure out the right way to bring balance.” kara nortman, a partner with the los angeles-based firm upfront ventures, is also concerned about the potential unforeseen consequences of warren’s proposals. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook “the specifics of the policy as presented strike me as having potentially negative consequences for innovation. these companies are funding massive innovation initiatives in our country. they’re creating jobs and taking risks in areas of technology development where we could potentially fall behind other countries and wind up reducing our quality of life,” nortman says. “we’re not seeing that innovation or initiative come from the government — or that support for encouraging immigration and by extension embracing the talented foreign entrepreneurs that could develop new technologies and businesses.” nortman sees the warren announcement as an attempt to start a dialog between government regulators and big technology companies. “my hope is that this is the beginning of a dialogue that is constructive,” nortman says. “and since elizabeth warren is a thoughtful policymaker, this is likely the first salvo toward an engagement with the technology community to work collaboratively on issues that we all want to see solved and that some of us are dedicating our career in venture to help solving.”"
"massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate elizabeth warren made waves yesterday when she outlined her plan for breaking up big tech companies like amazon, google and facebook. now, the verge reports warren also wants to break up apple. this, of course, makes sense given that apple falls into the bucket of a platform utility with more than $25 billion in global annual revenues. specifically, warren believes apple should not be able to both run the apple app store and distribute apps in it. “it’s got to be one or the other,” warren told the verge. “either they run the platform or they play in the store. they don’t get to do both at the same time.” warren’s proposal includes passing legislation to designate companies that offer marketplaces, exchanges or platforms for connecting third-parties with annual global revenues of more than $25 billion as “platform utilities.” “these companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,” warren wrote on medium yesterday. “platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.” that would mean amazon, for example, would not be able to sell its amazon basics line of products on its marketplace. same goes for apple, under warren’s proposal. “if you run a platform where others come to sell, then you don’t get to sell your own items on the platform because you have two comparative advantages,” warren said. “one, you’ve sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you’ve made a decision about what you’re going to sell. and second, you have the capacity — because you run the platform — to prefer your product over anyone else’s product. it gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.” in a comment to techcrunch, a spokesperson for warren confirmed that apple is indeed covered by her policy. “they are above $25 billion in revenue and so they would have to structurally separate – choosing between, for example, running the app store or offering their own apps,” the spokesperson said. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook"
"henrique dubugras contributor share on twitter henrique dubugras is the founder brex, the billion-dollar corporate credit provider for startups. more posts by this contributor why silicon valley needs more visas when i hear protesters shout, “immigrants are welcome here!” at the san francisco immigration office near my startup’s headquarters, i think about how simple a phrase that is for a topic that is so nuanced, especially for me as an immigrant entrepreneur. growing up in brazil, i am less familiar with the nuances of the american debate on immigration legislation, but i know that immigrants here add a lot of jobs and stimulate the local economy. as an immigrant entrepreneur, i’ve tried to check all of those boxes, and really prove my value to this country. my tech startup brex has achieved a lot in a short period of time, a feat which is underscored by receiving a $1 billion dollar valuation in just one year. but we didn’t achieve that high level of growth in spite of being founded by immigrants, but because of it. the key to our growth and to working toward building a global brand is our international talent pool; without it, we could never have gotten to where we are today. so beyond brex, what do the most successful silicon valley startups have in common? they’re also run by immigrants. in fact, not only are 57 percent of the bay area’s stem tech workers immigrants, they also make up 25 percent of business founders in the u.s. you can trace the immigrant entrepreneurial streak in silicon valley from the founders of sun microsystems and google to the valley’s most notorious twitter user, tesla’s elon musk. immigrants not only built the first microchips in silicon valley, but they built these companies into the tech titans they are known as today. after all, more than 50 percent of billion-dollar startups are founded by immigrants, and many of those startups were founded by immigrants on h-1b visas. photo courtesy of flickr/jvoves while it might sound counterintuitive, immigrants create more jobs and make our economy stronger. research from the national foundation of american policy (nfap) has shown that immigrant-founded billion-dollar companies doubled their number of employees over the past two years. according to the research, “wework went from 1,200 to 6,000 employees between 2016 and 2018, houzz increased from 800 to 1,800 employees the last two years, while cloudflare went from 225 to 715 employees.” we’ve seen the same growth at brex. in just one year we hired 70 employees and invested more than $6 million dollars in creating local jobs. our startup is not alone, as inc. recently reported, “50 immigrant-founded unicorn startups have a combined value of $248 billion, according to the report [by nfap], and have created an average of 1,200 jobs each.” one of the fundamental drivers of our success is our international workforce. many of our key hires are from all over latin america, spanning from uruguay to mexico. in fact, 42 percent of our workforce is made up of immigrants and another 6 percent is made up of children of immigrants. plenty of research shows that diverse teams are more productive and work together better, but that’s only part of the reason why you should bet on an international workforce. when you’re working with the best and brightest from every country, it inspires you to bring forth your most creative ideas, collaborate and push yourself beyond your comfort zone. it motivates you to be your best. with all of the positive contributions immigrants bring to this country, you’d think we’d have less restrictive immigration policies. however, that’s not the case. one of the biggest challenges that i face is hiring experienced, qualified engineers and designers to continue innovating in a fast-paced, competitive market. this is a universal challenge in the tech industry. for the past 10 years, software engineers have been the no. 1 most difficult job to fill in the united states. business owners are willing to pay 10-20 percent above the market rate for top talent and engineers. yet, we’re still projected to have a shortage of two million engineering jobs in the u.s. by 2022. how can you lead the charge of innovation if you don’t have the talent to do it? what makes matters worse is that there are so few opportunities and types of visas for qualified immigrants. this is limiting job growth, knowledge-sharing and technological breakthroughs in this country. and we risk losing top talent to other nations if we don’t loosen our restrictive visa laws. h-1b visa applications fell this year, and at the same time, these visas have become harder to obtain and it has become more expensive to acquire international talent. this isn’t the time to abandon the international talent pool, but to invest in highly specialized workers that can give your startup a competitive advantage. already, there’s been a dramatic spike in engineering talent moving to canada, with a 40 percent uptick in 2017. toronto, berlin and singapore are fast becoming burgeoning tech hubs, and many fear (rightfully) that they will soon outpace the u.s. in growth, talent and developing the latest technologies. u.s.-based tech companies generated $351 billion of revenue in 2018. the u.s. can’t afford to miss out on this huge revenue source. and, according to william r. kerr, harvard business school professor and the author of the gift of global talent: how migration shapes business, economy & society, “today’s knowledge economy dictates that your ability to attract, develop, and integrate smart minds governs how prosperous you will be.” immigrants have made silicon valley the powerhouse that it is today, and severely limiting highly skilled immigration benefits no one. immigrants have helped the u.s. build one of the best tech hubs in the world — now is the time for startups to invest in international talent so that our technology, economy and local communities can continue to thrive."
"microsoft today announced a new initiative that combines under a single umbrella all of the company’s gaming-related products for developers like xbox live, azure playfab, direct x, mixer, virtual studio, simplygon and azure . that umbrella, microsoft game stack, is meant to give game developers, no matter whether they are at a aaa studio or working solo, all the tools they need to develop and then operate their games across devices and platforms. “game stack brings together our game development platforms, tools and services like direct x and visual studio, azure and playfab into a robust ecosystem that any game developer can use,” said kareem choudhry, the corporate vice president for the microsoft gaming cloud. “we view this as a journey that we are just beginning.” it’s worth noting that developers can pick and choose which of the services they want to use. while azure is part of game stack, for example, the overall stack is cloud and device agnostic. undoubtedly, though, microsoft hopes that developers will adopt azure as their preferred cloud. these days, after all, most games feature some online component, even if they aren’t multiplayer games, and developers need a place to store player credentials, telemetry data and other info. one of the core components of game stack is playfab, a backend service for building cloud-connected games, which now falls under the azure family. microsoft acquired the service early last year and it’s worth noting that it supports all major gaming platforms, ranging from the xbox, playstation and nintendo switch to ios, android, pc and web. with today’s announcement, microsoft is launching a number of new playfab services, too. these include playfab matchmaking, a matchmaking service the company adapted from xbox live matchmaking, but that’s now available to all developers and on all devices. this service is now in public preview. in private preview are playfab party, a voice and chat service (also modeled after xbox party chat), playfab game insights for real-time game telemetry, playfab pub sub for pushing content updates, notifications and more to the game client, and playfab user generated content for allowing players to safely share content with each other. so while game stack may feel more like a branding exercise, it’s clear that playfab is where microsoft is really putting its money as it’s competing with amazon and google, both of which have recently put a lot of emphasis on game developers, too. in addition to these announcements, microsoft also today said that it is bringing an sdk for xbox live to ios and android devices so developers can integrate that service’s identity and community services into their games on those platforms, too."
"few countries have more entrepreneurial potential than india. it’s home not just to the wave of it offshoring firms of the 1990s and early 2000s, but also to some of the most interesting unicorn tech startups in the world, including freshworks, paytm, oyo and of course flipkart, which sold to walmart last year for $16 billion. india though is also at something of an economic crossroads. unlike china, which as we discussed yesterday faces a conflict between open entrepreneurship and strict party control in its next stage of development, india must build up its indigenous startups while also opening up to the global economy. that economic balancing act will be tough. as james crabtree, a long-time writer of the financial times based in mumbai, argues in his book the billionaire raj, india faces a triple threat of “inequality and the new super-rich, crony capitalism, and the travails of the industrial economy” as it seeks to move the country into middle-income status. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. crabtree, who built up access among india’s traditional business elite over many years, sees a nation that is starving for more government capacity. india has transitioned in a few short decades from a moribund economy languishing under a sclerotic and byzantine bureaucratic model (sometimes referred to as the “license raj”) into an increasingly open and competitive market for goods and services. yet, success outside of a scant few industries — namely it services — has been undergirded by political access and the trading of favors. crabtree chronicles a whole crop of entrepreneurs from across the country in industries as far afield as mining to liquor to aircraft to show the constant intermixing of indian business and indian politics. that crony capitalism is at the heart of what he dubs today’s “billionaire raj” — a government that isn’t for the ultra-rich so much as it lacks any capacity whatsoever to stand up to its worst excesses and corruption. the book is one part travelogue, one part analysis, and one part biographical bookshelf that together paint a complicated portrait of india’s growth ambitions and challenges to scale. given where india’s fortunes have been made the past few decades, the book mostly ignores the tech industry, save for fleeting mentions scattered about. but i asked crabtree in an interview last week where he saw the country headed, and how technology might underpin that. “people thought that india was going to become the next hot market for silicon valley tech money after china, but it doesn’t look like that will be the case,” he explained. unlike china, which created friction in market entry for foreign tech companies, india has been reasonably open. “the biggest search engine in india is google, the biggest social network is facebook,” he noted. “they don’t make much money in india, but they have spectacular user growth.” “when i lived in mumbai, there was a big tech investment wave in the after wave of the alibaba ipo,” he explained. “there were these great hopes that india would follow the sort of hockey stick growth” seen in china. yet, the country’s demographics don’t back that up. “india has a tiny middle class — 10-20 million” using a reasonable definition of the term “middle class.” that group is simply not large enough to support the valuation dreams underpinning some of india’s most-discussed unicorns. “growing users is really easy, but growing revenues is just much more challenging,” he said. the challenge ahead for india is that a form of economic nationalism is increasingly popular in delhi. we have covered a bit of this change around data localization / sovereignty, but it is certainly much wider than those policies. “i think there is a slow but steady trend toward closure that is partly to do with india’s domestic politics” and partly due to international climate, crabtree explained. the thinking is that, “china has produced alibaba, tencent, and baidu [… but] india hasn’t produced any major global stars yet.” fueling that rift is a sense that foreign tech giants “don’t pay much in the way of tax, they are not indian companies” and that they “haven’t behaved particularly well.” crabtree was referring specifically to facebook’s free basics program, which became deeply controversial in the country, although those feelings are not limited to just facebook. india has a massive election coming up in just a few weeks, which will decide whether current indian prime minister narendra modi stays in power. beyond just policy, crabtree sees a major challenge for all foreign tech companies, but particularly those operating social networks. “the stakes are very high for how social media manages the stresses and strains of a competitive and potentially nasty indian political campaign,” he said. “if they are blamed for something that went wrong… this would be immensely damaging.” india has the potential to be the single largest democratic free market economy in the world. but it needs to simultaneously cut down on its corruption, create jobs for millions of new entrants to the labor economy every year, stand up a new generation of digital-first behemoths, all the while balancing the needs of an incredibly diverse and cacophonous democracy buffeted by global markets and tastes. that’s ultimately a tall order, but if india wants to migrate from a “billionaire raj” to an “entrepreneur raj,” it will have to do all of that — at once. talking about borders: talent-friendly immigration driving tech north of the border roberto machado noa/lightrocket via getty images written by arman tabatabai yesterday, we talked about the growing difficulty of the h-1b visa application and approval process in the us, and how it threatens america’s long-term entrepreneurial edge. in a prime example of the connection between immigration policy and technology leadership — the ft put out a deep-dive analysis on the rapidly growing toronto tech and startup scene, with much of the expansion attributable to canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies. canada applies the “give grads a visa with their diploma” approach many have preached for in the us, providing multi-year work visas to foreign students upon graduation. and while the us continues to make the individual application process more difficult, canada has streamlined its process. applications for highly-skilled workers, as well as their families, are processed within just a couple weeks. while there are clearly several intertwined factors behind the growth of toronto as a tech hub, talent is certainly one of them, with the city having added nearly 100,000 jobs in a five-year period. toronto offers a case-in-point precedent of how cities can use immigration to gain a technological edge, and why the united states’ misdirected crackdown is undermining its own. intel cancels agreement with china chipmaker in fight for next generation chip dominance photo via intel corporation written by arman tabatabai intel continues to shift its strategy as it tries to improve its position for next-generation chip leadership. at the mwc conference in barcelona, intel announced that it was terminating a multi-year partnership with one of china’s premier state-backed mobile chipmakers, unisoc. as part of the original agreement announced roughly a year ago‚ intel would share its new 5g modem chips with unisoc to help intel increase its lagging market share in china, while providing unisoc technological know-how needed for it to compete with more-advanced competitor offerings. like many breakups, the two sides are saying the decision was mutual and not a result of the political tension between the us and chinese governments. however, the nikkei asian review reports that insiders say the us’ recent harsh tone with chinese tech and semiconductor companies definitely played a role in the decision. as we discussed yesterday, intel has a lot of catching up to do after years of complacency and will now have to find a different avenue to make up ground in the chinese market. unisoc is also certainly feeling the pain of the lost knowledge transfer, as market share can disappear quickly in a highly competitive industry where ip is often the secret sauce. the cancellation of what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal reinforces the fact that the fight for next-generation semiconductor dominance is just as much political as it is financial, if not more so. other news from around the world facebook’s censors are struggling at work casey newton at the verge offered us a deep-dive into the horrific working conditions and post-traumatic stress of

"a independent report commissioned by the uk government to examine how competition policy needs to adapt itself for the digital age has concluded that tech giants don’t face adequate competition and the law needs updating to address what it dubs the “novel” challenges of ‘winner takes all’ platforms. the panel also recommends more policy interventions to actively support startups, including a code of conduct for “the most significant digital platforms”; and measures to foster data portability, open standards and interoperability to help generate competitive momentum for rival innovations. uk chancellor philip hammond announced the competition market review last summer, saying the government was committed to asking “the big questions about how we ensure these new digital markets work for everyone”. the culmination of the review — a 150-page report, published today, entitled unlocking digital competition — is the work of the government’s digital competition expert panel which is chaired by former u.s. president barack obama’s chief economic advisor, professor jason furman. “the digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation. some say this is inevitable or even desirable. i think the uk can do better,” furman said today in a statement. in the report the panel writes that it believes competition policy should be “given the tools to tackle new challenges, not radically shifted away from its established basis”. “in particular, policy should remain based on careful weighing of economic evidence and models,” they suggest, arguing also that “consumer welfare” remains the “appropriate perspective to motivate competition policy” — and rejecting the idea that a completely new approach is needed. but, crucially, their view of consumer welfare is a broad church, not a narrow price trench — with the report asserting that a consumer welfare basis to competition law is able to also take account of other things, including (but also not limited to) “choice, quality and innovation”.  furman said the panel, which was established in september 2018, has outlined “a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies”. “these recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by uk tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection,” he argues. commenting on the report’s publication, hammond said: “competition is fundamental to ensuring the market works in the interest of consumers, but we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market,” adding that: “the work of jason furman and the expert panel is invaluable in ensuring we’re at the forefront of delivering a competitive digital marketplace.” the chancellor said that the government will “carefully examine” the proposals and respond later this year — with a plan for implementing changes he said are necessary “to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve”. pro-startup regulation required the panel rejects the view — mostly loudly propounded by tech giants and their lobbying vehicles — that competition is thriving online, ergo no competition policy changes are needed. it also rejects the argument that digital platforms are “natural monopolies” and competition is impossible — dismissing the idea of imposing utility-like regulation, such as in the energy sector. instead, the panel writes that it sees “greater competition among digital platforms as not only necessary but also possible — provided the right policies are in place”. the biggest “missing set of policies” are ones that would “actively help foster competition”, it argues in the report’s introduction. “instead of just relying on traditional competition tools, the uk should take a forward-looking approach that creates and enforces a clear set of rules to limit anti-competitive actions by the most significant digital platforms while also reducing structural barriers that currently hinder effective competition,” the panel goes on to say, calling for new rules to tackle ‘winner take all’ tech platforms that are based on “generally agreed principles and developed into more specific codes of conduct with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders”.  coupled with active policy efforts to support startups and scale-ups — by making it easier for consumers to move their data across digital services; pushing for systems to be built around open standards; and for data held by tech giants to be made available for competitors — the suggested reforms would support a system that’s “more flexible, predictable and timely” than the current regime, they assert. among the panel’s specific recommendations are a call to set up a new competition unit with expertise in technology, economics and behavioural science, plus the legal powers to back it up. the panel envisages this unit focusing on giving users more control over their data — to foster platform switching — as well as developing a code of competitive conduct that would apply to the largest platforms. “this would be applied only to particularly powerful companies, those deemed to have ‘strategic market status’, in order to avoid creating new burdens or barriers for smaller firms,” they write. another recommendation is to beef up regulators’ existing powers for tackling illegal anti-competitive practices — to make it quicker and simpler to prosecute breaches, with the report highlighting bullying tactics by market leaders as a current problem. “there is nothing inherently wrong about being a large company or a monopoly and, in fact, in many cases this may reflect efficiencies and benefits for consumers or businesses. but dominant companies have a particular responsibility not to abuse their position by unfairly protecting, extending or exploiting it,” they write. “existing antitrust enforcement, however, can often be slow, cumbersome, and unpredictable. this can be especially problematic in the fast-moving digital sector. “that is why we are recommending changes that would enable more use of interim measures to prevent damage to competition while a case is ongoing, and adjusting appeal standards to balance protecting parties’ interests with the need for the competition authority to have usable tools and an appropriate margin of judgement. the goal is to place less reliance on large fines and drawn-out procedures, instead enabling faster action that more directly targets and remedies the problematic behavior.” the expert panel also says changes to merger rules are required to enable the uk’s competition and markets authority (cma) to intervene to stop digital mergers that are likely to damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice — saying current decisions are too focused on short-term impacts. “over the last 10 years the 5 largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. none has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval, in the uk or elsewhere, or even been scrutinised by competition authorities,” they note. more priority should be given to reviewing the potential implications of digital mergers, in their view. decisions on whether to approve mergers, by the cma and other authorities, have often focused on short-term impacts. in dynamic digital markets, long-run effects are key to whether a merger will harm competition and consumers. could the company that is being bought grow into a competitor to the platform? is the source of its value an innovation that, under alternative ownership, could make the market less concentrated? is it being bought for access to consumer data that will make the platform harder to challenge? in principle, all of these questions can inform merger decisions within the current, mainstream framework for competition, centred on consumer welfare. there is no need to shift away from this, or implement a blanket presumption against digital mergers, many of which may benefit consumers. instead, these issues need to be considered more consistently and effectively in practice. in part the cma can achieve this through giving a higher priority to merger decisions in digital markets. these cases can be complex, but they affect markets that are critically important to consumers, providing services that shape the digital economy. in another recommendation which targets the google -facebook adtech duopoly, the report also calls for the cma to launch a formal market study into the digital advertising market — which it notes suffers from a lack of transparency. the panel also notes similar concerns raised by other recent reviews. digital advertising is increasingly driven by the use of consumers’ personal data for targeting. this in turn drives the competitive advantage for platforms able to learn more about more users’ identity, location and preferences. the market operates through a complex chain of advertising technology layers, where subsidiaries of the major platforms compete on opaque terms with third party businesses. this report joins the cairncross review and digital, culture, media and sport committee in calling for the cma to use its investigatory capabilities and powers to examine whether actors in these markets are operating appropriately to deliver effective competition and consumer benefit. the report also calls for new powers to force the largest tech companies to open up to smaller firms by providing access to key data sets, albeit without infringing on individual privacy — citing open banking as a “notable” data mobility model that’s up and running. “open banking provides an instructive example of how policy intervention can overcome technical and co-ordination challenges and misaligned incentives by creating an adequately funded body with the teeth to drive development and implementation by the nine largest financial institutions,” it suggests. the panel urges the uk to engage internationally on the issue of digital regulation, writing that: “many countries are considering policy changes in this area. the united kingdom has the opportunity to lead by example, by helping to stimulate a global discussion that is based on the shared premise that competition is beneficial, competition is possible, but that we need to update our policies to protect and expand this competition for the sake of consumers and vibrant, dynamic economies.” and in just one current example of the considerable chatter now going on around tech + competition, a house of lords committee this week also recommended public interest tests for proposed tech mergers, and suggested an overarching digital regulator is needed to help plug legislative gaps and work through regulatory overlap. discussing the pros and cons of concentration in digital markets, the expert competition panel notes the efficiency and convenience that this dynamic can offer consumers and businesses, as well as potential gains via product innovation. however the panel also points to what it says can be “substantial downsides” from digital market concentration, including erosion of consumer privacy; barriers to entry and scale for startups; and blocks to wider innovation, which it asserts can “outweigh any static benefits” — writing: it can raise effective prices for consumers, reduce choice, or impact quality. even when consumers do not have to pay anything for the service, it might have been that with more competition consumers would have given up less in terms of privacy or might even have been paid for their data. it can be harder for new companies to enter or scale up. most concerning, it could impede innovation as larger companies have less to fear from new entrants and new entrants have a harder time bringing their products to market — creating a trade-off where the potential dynamic costs of concentration outweigh any static benefits. the panel takes a clear view that “competition for the market cannot be counted on, by itself, to solve the problems associated with market tipping and ‘winner-takes-most’” — arguing that past regulatory interventions have helped shift market conditions, i.e. by facilitating the technology changes that created new markets and companies which led to dominant tech giants of old being unseated. so, in other words, the panel believes government action can unlock market disruption — hence the report’s title — and that it’s too simplistic a narrative to claim technological change alone will reset markets. for example, ibm’s dominance of hardware in the 1960s and early 1970s was rendered less important by the emergence of the pc and software. microsoft’s dominance of operating systems and browsers gave way to a shift to the internet and an expansion of choice. but these changes were facilitated, in part, by government policy — in particular antitrust cases against these companies, without which the changes may never have happened. the panel also argues there’s an acceleration of market dominance in the modern digital economy that makes it even more necessary for governments to respond, writing that “network effects and returns to scale of data appear to be even more entrenched and the market seems to have stabilised quickly compared to the much larger degree of churn in the early days of the world wide web”. they also point to the risk of ai and machine learning technology leading to further market concentration, warning that “the companies most able to take advantage of [the next technological revolution] may well be the existing large companies because of the importance of data for the successful use of these tools”. and while they suggest ai startups might offer a route to a competitive reset, via a substantial technology shift, there’s still currently no relief to be had from entrepreneurial efforts because of “the degree that entrants are acquired by the largest companies – with little or no scrutiny”. discussing other difficulties related to regulating big tech, the panel warns of the risk of regulators being “captured by the companies they are regulating”; as well as point out they are generally at a disadvantage vs the high tech innovators they are seeking to rule. in a concluding chapter considering the possible impacts of their policy recommendations, the panel argues that successful execution of their approach could help foster startup innovation across a range of sectors and services. “across digital markets, implementing the recommendations will enable more new companies to turn innovative ideas into great new services and profitable businesses,” they suggest. “some will continue to be acquired by large platforms, where that is the best route to bring new technology to a large group of users. others will grow and operate alongside the large platforms. digital services will be more diverse, more dynamic, with more specialisation and choice available for consumers wanting it. this could drive a flourishing of investment in these uk businesses.” citing some “potential examples” of services that could evolve in this more supportively competitive environment they suggest social content aggregators might arise that “bring together the best material from people’s friends across different platforms and sites”; “privacy services could give consumers a single simple place to manage the information they share across different platforms”; and also envisage independent ad tech businesses and changed market dynamics that can “rebalance the share of advertising revenue back towards publishers”. the main envisaged benefits for consumers boil down to greater service and feature choice; enhanced privacy and transparency; and genuine control over the services they use and how they want to use them. while for startups and scale-ups the panel sees open standards and access to data — and indeed effective enforcement, by the new digital markets unit — creating “a wide range of opportunities to develop and serve new markets adjacent to or interconnected with existing digital platforms”. the combined impact should be to strengthen and deepen the competitive digital ecosystem, they believe. another envisaged benefit for startups is “trust in the framework and recognition that promising, innovative digital businesses will be protected from foreclosure or exclusion” — which they argue “should catalyse investment in uk digital businesses, driving the sector’s growth”. “the changes to competition law… mean that where a business can grow into a successful competitor, that route to further growth is protected and companies will not in the future see being subsumed into a dominant platform as the only realistic business model,” they add."
"the influential massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful elizabeth warren has been a longtime critic of the consolidation of economic power by amazon, google and facebook. now she’s making their break-up a key component of her presidential platform. warren has just released her plan for breaking up big tech, in what seems like a watershed moment for a democratic nominee. since al gore famously (infamously?) “invented the internet,” democratic candidates have turned away from serious regulation of technology companies, preferring instead to receive their campaign contributions. eric schmidt and google donors were hugely important to the obama campaign, and big tech companies were among his biggest supporters. now, warren has said (on medium no less) that the massive market power that google, facebook and amazon wield is a threat and will be treated accordingly. “twenty-five years ago, facebook, google, and amazon didn’t exist,” writes warren. “now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. it’s a great story — but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.” the parallel she uses to make her case is the breakup of microsoft, which she weirdly calls “the tech giant of its time” (microsoft is still a tech giant), and holds as perhaps the last example when government went toe to toe with the technology industry. “the government’s antitrust case against microsoft helped clear a path for internet companies like google and facebook to emerge,” warren writes. but now the companies that flourished in the wake of the microsoft case have, themselves, become too powerful, she argues. “they’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. and in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,” writes warren. the key components of the warren plan include passing legislation that would designate companies with annual global revenue above $25 billion that provide marketplace, exchange or third-party connectivity as “platform utilities” and prohibit those companies from owning participants on their platforms. it’s a dragnet that now encompasses alphabet and amazon (but i don’t think it touches facebook?). the new law would also be required to meet a standard of fair and non-discriminatory use with their users, and platforms would be restricted from sharing user data with third parties. for companies with revenues below $25 billion, they’d be required to adhere to the fair use standard. warren would give state attorneys general and private parties the right to sue a platform for conduct that violates those requirements and the government could fine a company 5 percent of their annual revenue for violating the terms of the new legislation. as warren notes, “amazon marketplace, google’s ad exchange, and google search would be platform utilities under this law. therefore, amazon marketplace and basics, and google’s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. google search would have to be spun off as well.” the second (and more aggressive) part of warren’s plan would be the appointment of regulators to roll back acquisitions that warren deems anti-competitive. in amazon’s case that means whole foods and zappos would have to be spun back out. alphabet would have to unwind google’s acquisitions of waze, nest and doubleclick (but not youtube?), and facebook would have to part with whatsapp and instagram. “unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market — which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,” warren writes. her call for regulation is a big moment for the tech industry; it should also serve as a wake-up call for these companies to do more than just pay lip service to the problems their dominance is causing in the marketplace. as warren writes: we must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold — and do it in a way that doesn’t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data. we must help america’s content creators — from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians — keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like google and facebook. and we must ensure that russia — or any other foreign power — can’t use facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections. those are each tough problems, but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too. more competition means more options for consumers and content creators, and more pressure on companies like facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses."
"there is a deep dilemma facing startup founders that i think just isn’t brought to light often enough. on one hand, almost all (and i do mean almost all) founders are reasonably ethical people. they can be over-optimistic, they can over-promise, they can be inexperienced around management, but at their core, they want to improve the world, build something new, and yes, make (a lot) of money while doing it. yet, if you really want to grow fast — so fast that you can go from piddling startup to $1.7 billion-valued banking unicorn in less than four years — then there are only so many ways to do that ethically. or even legally, given that the laws around industries like banking aren’t designed for high growth, but rather sedentary expansion. here’s a lesson that i think founders internalize very, very early: growth solves all problems. and it is absolutely, 100 percent true. growth absolutely solves all problems. want to make your next fundraise a cinch? if you grow 5x or 7x year-over-year, watch as dozens of venture firms squabble to get access to that cap table. want to hire faster and attract better talent? growing at top speed is an easy way to lock in those people.

giddy excitement of a vc who is seeing their yacht / napa vineyard / atherton estate being financed before their very eyes. boards don’t ask tough questions in periods of high growth, they double down: “do everything to keep this rocket ship shooting for the stratosphere.” in these situations, it is nearly impossible to balance growth and ethics. you can’t just say, “turn on the money laundering thing again and we will accept 5x instead of 7x” or whatever. the whole organism of the startup has been geared for growth. hell, even the people not working for the company (but want to) are geared for growth. every salary bump, equity distribution, performance evaluation, feedback, kpi and firing is predicated on growth. sometimes you get away with it, and sometimes you don’t. uber got away with it, zenefits did not. so where does revolut sit, which i’ve been foreshadowing here? by now, you might have come across the three-part story arc of revolut, a digital banking service based in london. in part one, revolut is a fintech darling founded in july 2015 that has since raised $336 million in venture capital within four years at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to crunchbase. insane growth, huge market, real product. it’s the best first act for a startup one can possibly hope for. then the bad news started hitting hard this week. in act two, we get this wired exposé by emiliano mellino that discusses the atrocious working conditions of the company along with deeply questionable employee interview tactics: she did a 30-minute job interview over google hangouts with the london-based head of business development, andrius biceika, and was immediately told she had passed to the next round, which would involve a small test. “the surprise came when i received the task and it asked me to get the company as many clients as possible, with each one depositing €10 into the app,” says laura. and using fear to goad performance: last spring, ceo nikolay storonsky sent an announcement to all staff through the company’s slack messaging service, saying that any members of staff “with performance rating [sic] ‘significantly below expectations’ will be fired without any negotiation after the review”. … around this time, ceo nikolay storonsky gave an interview to business insider where he said revolut’s philosophy was to “get shit done”, a slogan that is emblazoned on the company’s london office walls in bright neon lights. in an echo to what was going on in these calls, storonsky would go on to say in the interview that the company attracted people that want to grow and “growing is always through pain”. well, there is more growth to come, because act three is going to bring a very painful episode for the company. my colleague jon russell noted that revolut’s cfo has resigned in the wake of a daily telegraph investigation showing that revolut had switched off the anti-money-laundering safeguards at the company, because, well, it got in the way of growth. let’s be clear: we all love a rapidly growing startup. we all want to invest in or join a winner. but what are we willing to forego to get it? are we willing to push ethical boundaries? are we willing to use dark patterns to force those numbers higher? are we willing to break the law and potentially go to prison? our love of growth often knows no bounds. in context, i’m sure revolut’s decision came easily, but of course, for disinterested observers, the idea that you would switch off the aml system at a banking startup just looks like complete stupidity. yet, i am not sure i am ready to blame the employees of revolut (or its leaders, frankly) before i place the blame on a culture that demands extreme growth and dislikes it when the consequences come to bear. you can’t get extreme growth without something breaking. we need to decide which value is more important for us. extra crunch ethics series not sure we are going to be able to answer all the questions posed by revolut, but extra crunch will be hosting a series of dialogues around tech ethics in the coming weeks that will try to parse some of the tough challenges that come from technology and startups these days. stay tuned. why fundamental self-interest causes u.s. infrastructure to fall flat on its face simon mcgill via getty images written by arman tabatabai yesterday, dj gribbin, a fellow at brookings and a senior u.s. government infrastructure official, published an op-ed in which he attributes the u.s.’ infrastructure struggles largely to 1) a misunderstanding of federal fund availability, 2) the fragmentation and variability of local infrastructure needs and 3) misaligned incentives for local politicians and contractors. local politicians push heavily for the federal government to cover a portion of their bill, advertising the money as free to their constituents. in reality, investing federal funds is a zero-sum game that requires either more taxation, higher debt or pulling money from elsewhere. what results are the competitive bid and bureaucratic review processes we discussed earlier this week that ultimately lead to gamesmanship and misinformation. the federal-local coordination has grown more difficult as projects have become more localized with region-specific needs and benefits, compared to national projects of old like the highway system. now, executing local developments depends on coordination between federal, state and local governments, leading to the political pissing contests we all know and love. in gribbin’s mind, the biggest flaw in the u.s.’ approach to infrastructure — also raised in our conversation with infrastructure expert phil plotch — is the misaligned incentive system that encourages bad behavior from all parties. the complexity of approval and funding processes causes local politicians to either delay projects as they lobby for federal funding or to “overpromise and underdeliver” on costs and benefits to push a project through. similarly, competitive rfp bidding used to reduce cost estimates encourages contractors to similarly overpromise, leading to plan revisions, construction issues and delays that seem to be inevitable for every major project. clearly more needs to be done to align the incentives of each of these players. software and infrastructure jaylazarin via getty images written by arman tabatabai new york city rail operators grew frustrated this week with the contractors hired to install a new safety system. fumbled management and failed execution on what was thought to be a simple tech integration have caused multi-year delays, potentially pushing completion past the deadline set by the federal railroad administration for railroads across the country to upgrade their safety systems. only about one-tenth of the mandated rails had successfully upgraded their system as of last year as local agencies continue to struggle with designing software and hardware platforms compatible with other trains that may use their lines. that pattern is also found in new york. from the wall street journal article: the projects have suffered a series of setbacks because of understaffing by the contractors as well as software and hardware failures. those failures include the recall of antennas that were installed on more than 1,000 rail cars and that were later found to be defective. “it was a novice error and we did not believe we had hired novices,” mta board member susan metzger said. the new york project mimics issues plaguing projects throughout the u.s., where contractors use the “overpromise, underdeliver” strategy to win competitive bids. add in software incompetence and you get the mess that new york is facing now. dc commutes suck more than in nyc and sf, even before amazon materializes richard sharrocks via getty images written by arman tabatabai according to a new data set from bloomberg, the cost of commuting into washington, d.c. is higher than any other metro in the u.s. though density is clearly a factor here, workers in the greater d.c. area face the longest commute time in the country at nearly 80 minutes on average. bloomberg then derived a “score” for the opportunity cost of commutes based on average annual incomes and average total annual commuting hours per worker, weighted based for other externalities such as how early or late average departures were. d.c. is in the midst of seriously expanding its metrorail system but, unsurprisingly, the project has gone far from smoothly. bloomberg’s findings stress the need for an improved transit system in the region, but based on precedent and progress to date it’s unclear if and when the full expansion will be complete and at what ungodly cost. we’re planning on diving deeper into d.c.’s metrorail expansion project as we read the great society subway by zachary schrag, which just arrived at extra crunch hq this week. obsessions we have a bit of a theme around

"youtube will shut off comments on videos featuring “younger minors and videos with older minors at risk of attracting predatory behavior,” according to a statement from the company. it’s an effort to stamp out predatory behavior from viewers that included salacious notes in the comments section of videos featuring underage kids. last week, techcrunch confirmed reports which first arose on reddit about the existence of a soft-core pedophile ring that was communicating via youtube’s comments section and disseminating videos of minors by gaming the company’s search algorithms. youtube creator matt watson flagged the problem in a subreddit, noting that he found scores of videos of kids where youtube users are trading inappropriate comments and identifying timestamps to focus on below the fold. watson denounced the company for failing to prevent what he describes as a “soft-core pedophilia ring” from operating in plain sight on its platform. youtube under fire for recommending videos of kids with inappropriate comments the reports brought condemnation from several businesses that advertise on youtube (the company’s primary source of revenue). disney, fortnite maker epic games, mcdonald’s and nestlé foods reportedly all pulled advertising from the site in the wake of the scandal. “over the past week, we’ve been taking a number of steps to better protect children and families, including suspending comments on tens of millions of videos,” a google spokesperson said in a statement emailed to techcrunch. “now, we will begin suspending comments on most videos that feature minors, with the exception of a small number of channels that actively moderate their comments and take additional steps to protect children. we understand that comments are an important way creators build and connect with their audiences; we also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the youtube community.” the rollout of the new moderating tools will take several months, according to youtube. and while the company acknowledged the severity of the changes and the impact it may have on youtubers, it said it was taking action to prevent the exploitation of minors on the platform. a small number of known channels will be able to keep their comments sections up, but will be required to actively monitor them beyond simply using youtube’s own moderation tools, the company said. youtube also is speeding up the launch of a new classification tool that can detect and remove twice as many individual comments as in the past — accelerating the automation of content moderation (which could, itself, have unintended consequences). in a related move designed to protect children from abhorrent content, youtube has terminated the channel filthyfrankclips and several other channels that were reportedly instructing children on how to slash their wrists. first reported in the washington post, the clips from the channel contained children’s videos spliced with content on self-harm, according to an initial report on the blog, pedimom. youtube kids scare as we noted in our earlier reporting, this isn’t the first time that youtube has been identified as a haven for pedophiles hiding in plain sight: back in november 2017, several major advertisers froze spending on youtube’s platform after an investigation by the bbc and the times discovered similarly obscene comments on videos of children. earlier the same month youtube was also criticized over low-quality content targeting kids as viewers on its platform. the company went on to announce a number of policy changes related to kid-focused video, including saying it would aggressively police comments on videos of kids and that videos found to have inappropriate comments about the kids in them would have comments turned off altogether. some of the videos of young girls that youtube recommended we watch had already had comments disabled — which suggests its ai had previously identified a large number of inappropriate comments being shared (on account of its policy of switching off comments on clips containing kids when comments are deemed “inappropriate”) — yet the videos themselves were still being suggested for viewing in a test search that originated with the phrase “bikini haul.” youtube addressed its creators earlier today in a blog post telling them about the steps it was taking."
"asus just announced the first — but surely not the last — combination router/alexa smart speaker of the show. the lyra voice is a pretty decent looking thing — covered in the sort of fabric design that’s become all rage with smart speakers like the google home and the latest iteration of the echo. in fact, the product looks a lot more like a speaker than router, with cones one opposite ends of the oblong device. there’s a pair of eight-watt speakers, which can be used to play music via bluetooth or for your standard alexa commands. the device features the company’s proprietary aimesh technology, meaning you can pair it with other asus lyra devices to take care of dead spots in your home. of course, at $220, it’s a bit more than other systems mesh systems — though this one’s doing double duty. it’s an interesting emerging category. asus certainly isn’t the first company to bring a combo router/smart speaker to the market — netgear beat the company to it by a couple of months with the orbi. but it’s a hybrid product that makes sense for those who want an alexa product in every room of the home. the lyra voice hits retail later this month."
"very rarely does an early technology garner such an air of inevitability like ar has in the past few years. 2018 was supposed to be a year where the foundational tech for augmented reality was built out a bit and the industry took a couple big leaps. things started off well-enough, but momentum really doesn’t seem be on the side of some of the industry’s heaviest hitters heading into 2019, suggesting that life for earlier-stage startups may not be much easier. there are plenty of reasons to be long-term bullish on ar, but the time horizons some have espoused seems to be bogus and pitch decks organized around a near-term spike in phone-based or glasses-based users are going to have a tougher time being taken seriously in 2019. the ghost with the most for all of the ar advances made this year, the company most emblematic of ar’s numerous challenges was clearly magic leap . the company spent the past few years trashing industry standards and lauding their own approaches with braggadocio, but ended up releasing a product that largely iterated on its competitors. with the release of their “developer kit” this year, a product that clearly seems to have stopped being a first-gen product only when the reality of the climate availed itself, the startup seems to be finding that optics and infra progress is going to come more slowly than foretold. i’ve talked to more than a few people who think magic leap hindered progress in the ar industry by siphoning investor attention and discouraging other hardware startups from joining the fray in the face of a billions-backed unknown. but in 2019, there are fewer available plays for the funding juggernaut. they spent years trying to distinguish themselves from the corporate mission of microsoft and their hololens headset; now it seems they’ve begun to see that the only hope of justifying their sitting valuation in the next few years is enlisting support from the big customers that msft is chasing, as opposed to single-handedly birthing a consumer market. magic leap recently lost a bid to microsoft for a $480 million military contract to outfit troops with ar headsets, and as microsoft prepares to release a second-generation hololens with the enterprise in full concentration, it seems like magic leap is going to reshuffle its deck. dead-on-arrival content plays magic leap’s struggles are well-documented, but what plagues the overall ar industry seems less discussed. the consumer appetite for phone-based ar content is obviously lacking. even apple’s reality distortion field isn’t enough to convince people that its arkit releases have led to anything other than some weird experimentation for ios users. few android oems are boasting about compatibility with google’s arcore platform anymore, suggesting that approachable hardware standards for device makers wasn’t all that was missing from the failed tango brand. the most apparent mobile ar opportunities are probably in user-generated content, but there seems to be a disconnect between platforms and users in terms of how complex these ar experiences can and should become. at this point, selfie masks still seem to be at the edge of users’ comfort levels, leaving a lot of solved tech problems stuck in limbo waiting for a problem that makes them worthwhile. niantic is probably one of the most revenue-heavy startups dabbling in phone ar, even if it is a bit of a false idol for the industry. nobody seems to think of niantic as a capital-a augmented reality startup, but it’s clear that the team behind pokémon go sees the technology as a not-fully-tapped reservoir of potential for future gaming experiences that feel more social and more immersive than any mobile rpg that’s sucking up the majority of your playtime today. the company’s new harry potter title still doesn’t have a release date, we haven’t seen any gameplay, but we do know that ar plays a part in the title in some capacity. we’ll see if they figure out things the rest of the industry hasn’t. platform tech opportunities part of this broader content pain is the fact that some known platform fundamentals are still getting tackled. in 2018, the startups in ar that were raising the most buzz were so-called “ar cloud” startups, teams that were largely focused on solving more fundamental back-end problems around localization and mapping. it turns out “simple” problems like getting a bunch of users in a single session or keeping track of objects you’ve moved around between sessions are actually incredibly complex. 6d.ai is building ar tech that crowdsources a 3d mesh of the world a big issue is that ar fundamentally relies on a level of spatial understanding that goes far beyond grasping geometry. for all the ground that has been traversed by computer vision researchers this year, issues like segmenting environments by objects and accurately identifying them are still in the earliest stages. when you think of ar tech as a subset of vision problems, you realize that products today are being approached in a kind of bizarre manner. google has been making worthwhile movements in proliferating their lens computer vision engine across new apps and devices. in a very roundabout way, the company seems to have come to the worthwhile perspective that mapping an environment spatially doesn’t really help that much if you can’t parse the contextual nuances of what the camera is actually looking at, as well. a lot of the ar startups in this space have raised some cash on the backs of the smartphone ar trend and the hundreds of millions of potential users, but it still seems pretty dubious whether this market has legs. fortunately, most of these solutions have wide applicability across future industries like robotics and autonomous vehicles, helping computers interface with the real world through visual and geographic cues, but their utility might not be as ripe as they’d hope. this is an area where magic leap could be poised to find some relatively near-term success. the startup’s top brass spent a hefty amount of time at their developer conference talking about the “magicverse,” basically their vision for bringing localized ar layers onto geographic spaces where users with magic leap glasses could observe the content. without having taken a peek at the tech they’re working with, their biggest advantage seems to rely on their partnership with at&t, which is poised to start working more seriously with 5g in 2019. the back end still remains a much more exciting market than hardware in 2019, but there may still be some interesting movement with devices this year. i don’t trust most of the predictive data that exists surrounding headset sales, so i’m not even going to reference it; suffice to say that ar headset sales aren’t going to explode anytime soon. north focals more conservative ar hardware one trend that i am curious to see shake out is the more simplistic version of ar where the glasses basically just offer users a heads-up display for notifications and lightweight apps. companies like north and vuzix have been talking a lot about their work here. apple’s rumored ar glasses have been talked about for ages at this point, with 2020/2021 seeming to be the rumor mill sweet spot for a release time frame. if that’s the case, i’d bet it falls more into this design ethos than a hololens type device. the hardware just isn’t small enough yet, but it is getting close, and there could be some interesting early ground that the industry could gain by moving in more heavily on traditional wearable use cases — though high component costs will be an early limiter as well. ar glasses startup north picks up intel’s vaunt patents this is probably a hardware space snap has their eyes on; spectacles jogged a lot of the current thinking on glasses-type wearables, but at this point, the company needs something that has wide appeal and can feed users back into its own app. the company isn’t in a position to hock something with razor-thin or non-existent margins, and it doesn’t gain that much from a product that sells a few thousand units in terms of building its platform. bottom line for the facebooks and apples of the world, immediate market conditions and user interest obviously hold a different weight. u.s. investment firms with good track records spent a lot of time this year rejiggering their expectations for their first waves of investments. for the more ambitious privately held ar startups of the world, there’s probably going to be an issue with raising capital this year, as a lot of the top hardware companies have been seeking more free-flowing late-stage cash from chinese firms, which have been growing harder to pin down as the trade climate worsens. this is going to be a problem for hardware companies especially. after $130m+ in funding, ar startup blippar collapses for the most part, the bs is going to continue to get easier to parse this year. platform plays are going to have to dial in their target audience a bit more than “everyone with an ar-enabled phone”; more realistic expectations are something the industry should benefit from. arkit and arcore are going to level-up and game engine-makers are going to get better solutions for ar content creators. back-end vision challenges are going to get solved and enable things like more seamless multi-player, but there are plenty of reasons why these tech problem solutions won’t lead to big changes in user behavior. users failing to take off in the second year of some of these big platforms probably won’t dissuade apple, but it definitely will dissuade some investors from continuing to bet big on the near-term future of mobile ar."
"when the government seized classified-ads site backpage, forcing it to shut down in april, it became a lot harder to find and locate potential victims of sex trafficking. while it was symbolically good that the site, whose ceo later pleaded guilty to charges of sex trafficking, shut down, it created a significant technical challenge for law enforcement and the organizations trying to help prevent sex-trafficking, google senior software engineer sam ainsley told techcrunch. “once backpage was gone, you were looking at an ecosystem in which all of those previously more centralized advertisements [for those being sex trafficked] are being redistributed on much more websites,” ainsley said. ainsley got involved with this work through google.org’s new fellowship program, which embeds google engineers inside nonprofit organizations on a full-time basis for six months. she did this work at thorn, a nonprofit organization founded by ashton kutcher that seeks to protect children from sexual abuse and trafficking. thorn was the first nonprofit to host google fellows. when backpage was up-and-running, thorn had been indexing the advertisements and then providing them to law enforcement in order to facilitate the recovery of victims. that task became harder once backpage shut down. while working at thorn, ainsley and four other google engineers set out to help make this information more easily available to law enforcement. washington, dc – february 15: ashton kutcher, actor and co-founder of thorn: digital defenders of children, speaks at a senate foreign relations committee hearing on ending modern slavery: building on success at dirksen senate office building on february 15, 2017 in washington, dc. (photo by paul morigi/wireimage) “the goal of this project was to create actual profiles of victims so that this information could be as accessible as possible,” ainsley said. “that you could actually understand that victim’s history and where they might be at any given period of time; what are the cities they’ve been in over time; what are the various phone numbers they’ve used over time? how that has their appearance changed? this is all incredibly important because, in this space, that is the strategy. it’s to change things as quickly as possible to evade being found. so it’s really about taking a holistic approach and a personal approach.” google machine learning engineers were able to take the massive number of ads and try to understand which advertisements belonged to one individual, and then formulate that one person’s history, ainsley said. as a data visualization expert, ainsley’s part was to visualize all of that information in a way that is accessible to law enforcement. “at this point in time we have built a prototype that we’re really excited about,” ainsley said. “so we’re really optimistic about where this can go.” although her fellowship is over, ainsley said she’s going to stay on working with the thorn team one day a week because she wants to see the work taken all the way into the field. “that’s the dream and i want to be available as much as i possibly can to assist in that effort,” ainsley said. (l) doug grundman, google.org fellow and software engineer, google; (r) julie cordua, ceo, thorn. photo via google thorn ceo julie cordua told techcrunch it was a successful product, noting it “was an exploration we’ve been wanting to do for quite a while.” in addition to working with law enforcement around sex trafficking, thorn tackles child pornography, live-stream abuse and grooming. the organization also works to activate companies in the private sector to identify and remove child porn. thorn recently launched safer, a tool for small to medium-sized businesses to identify child pornography on their platforms. currently, imgur, roblox and flickr are participating in the beta program. “larger companies have good systems in place but when you don’t have the capacity to build out risks teams, then this type of bad content starts to flourish,” cordua said. “that’s what we’re trying to solve for.” (l) samantha ainsley, google.org fellow and software engineer, google; (r) doug grundman, google.org fellow and software engineer, google. photo via google. thorn was the first partner for the google.org fellowship, but there are two active fellowships at the family independence initiative and goodwill, which started in november. before selecting an organization to work with, google.org examines the potential for impact and ability of the organization to continue the work once the google engineer leaves. “and we want to look for an area where there’s a really complex challenge where technology is the solution, or at least is a solution that can really help move the needle,” google.org product manager and head of technical team jen carter told techcrunch. and for google, it’s a good retention strategy. ainsley, for example, said the opportunity came at the right time because she had actually been considering leaving the company. “i had been at this crossroads in my career as an engineer, where i was feeling pretty siloed in terms of the impact that my work was having,” ainsley said. “i loved the work i was doing from a technical aspect — i always have — but i was considering potentially even exploring different career options because it was unclear to me how, through programming, i could have a direct impact on people’s lives. and that was something that i really wanted. and when this program was posted, it was right around that time.” cordua agrees, noting that it could be a good retention strategy for companies. it’s also a model that she thinks should be replicated by other tech companies. “our goal is to get more companies to think about this for their engineering teams,” cordua said. “it’s an opportunity to build engineering teams that have empathy and understanding of tech’s social impact on both negative and positive things. tech can do amazing things. let’s channel it toward these social issues.”"
"a report by the lead data watchdog for a large number of tech giants operating in europe shows a significant increase in privacy complaints and data breach notifications since the region’s updated privacy framework came into force last may. the irish data protection commission (dpc)’s annual report, published today, covers the period may 25, aka the day the eu’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) came into force, to december 31 2018 and shows the dpc received more than double the amount of complaints post-gdpr vs the first portion of 2018 prior to the new regime coming in: with 2,864 and 1,249 complaints received respectively. that makes a total of 4,113 complaints for full year 2018 (vs just 2,642 for 2017). which is a year on year increase of 36 per cent. but the increase pre- and post-gdpr is even greater — 56 per cent — suggesting the regulation is working as intended by building momentum and support for individuals to exercise their fundamental rights. “the phenomenon that is the [gdpr] has demonstrated one thing above all else: people’s interest in and appetite for understanding and controlling use of their personal data is anything but a reflection of apathy and fatalism,” writes helen dixon, ireland’s commissioner for data protection. she adds that the rise in the number of complaints and queries to dpas across the eu since may 25 demonstrates “a new level of mobilisation to action on the part of individuals to tackle what they see as misuse or failure to adequately explain what is being done with their data”. while europe has had online privacy rules since 1995 a weak regime of enforcement essentially allowed them to be ignored for decades — and internet companies to grab and exploit web users’ data without full regard and respect for european’s privacy rights. but regulators hit the reset button last year. and ireland’s data watchdog is an especially interesting agency to watch if you’re interested in assessing how gdpr is working, given how many tech giants have chosen to place their international data flows under the irish dpc’s supervision. more cross-border complaints “the role places an important duty on the dpc to safeguard the data protection rights of hundreds of millions of individuals across the eu, a duty that the gdpr requires the dpc to fulfil in cooperation with other supervisory authorities,” the dpc writes in the report, discussing its role of supervisory authority for multiple tech multinationals and acknowledging both a “greatly expanded role under the gdpr” and a “significantly increased workload”. a breakdown of gdpr vs data protection act 1998 complaint types over the report period suggests complaints targeted at multinational entities have leapt up under the new dp regime. for some complaint types the old rules resulted in just 2 per cent of complaints being targeted at multinationals vs close to a quarter (22 per cent) in the same categories under gdpr. it’s the most marked difference between the old rules and the new — underlining the dpc’s expanded workload in acting as a hub (and often lead supervisory agency) for cross-border complaints under gdpr’s one-stop shop mechanism. the category with the largest proportions of complaints under gdpr over the report period was access rights (30%) — with the dpc receiving a full 582 complaints related to people feeling they’re not getting their due data. access rights was also most complained about under the prior data rules over this period. other prominent complaint types continue to be unfair processing of data (285 gdpr complaints vs 178 under the dpa); disclosure (217 vs 138); and electronic direct marketing (111 vs 36). eu policymakers’ intent with gdpr is to redress the imbalance of weakly enforced rights — including by creating new opportunities for enforcement via a regime of supersized fines. (gdpr allows for penalties as high as up to 4 per cent of annual turnover, and in january the french data watchdog slapped google with a $57m gdpr penalty related to transparency and consent — albeit still far off that theoretical maximum.) importantly, the regulation also introduced a collective redress option which has been adopted by some eu member states. this allows for third party organizations such as consumer rights groups to lodge data protection complaints on individuals’ behalf. the provision has led to a number of strategic complaints being filed by organized experts since last may (including in the case of the aforementioned google fine) — spinning up momentum for collective consumer action to counter rights erosion. again that’s important in a complex area that remains difficult for consumers to navigate without expert help. for upheld complaints the gdpr ‘nuclear option’ is not fines though; it’s the ability for data protection agencies to order data controllers to stop processing data. that remains the most significant tool in the regulatory toolbox. and depending on the outcome of various ongoing strategic gdpr complaints it could prove hugely significant in reshaping what data experts believe are systematic privacy incursions by adtech platform giants. and while well-resourced tech giants may be able to factor in even very meaty financial penalties, as just a cost of doing a very lucrative business, data-focused business models could be far more precarious if processors can suddenly be slapped with an order to limit or even cease processing data. (as indeed facebook’s business just has in germany, where antitrust regulators have been liaising with privacy watchdogs.) data breach notifications also up gdpr also shines a major spotlight on security — requiring privacy by design and default and introducing a universal requirement for swiftly reporting data breaches across the bloc, again with very stiff penalties for non-compliance. on the data breach front, the irish dpc says it received a total of 3,687 data breach notifications between may 25 and december 31 last year — finding just four per cent (145 cases) did not meet the definition of a personal-data breach set out in gdpr. that means it recorded a total of 3,542 valid data protection breaches over the report period — which it says represents an increase of 27 per cent on 2017 breach report figures. “as in other years, the highest category of data breaches notified under the gdpr were classified as unauthorised disclosures and accounted for just under 85% of the total data-breach notifications received between 25 may and 31 december 2018,” it notes, adding: “the majority occurred in the private sector (2,070).” more than 4,000 data breach notifications were recorded by the watchdog for full year 2018, the report also states. for the earlier 2018 period, from january 1 to may 24 2018, a dpc spokesman told us it recorded 1198 valid data security breaches — making the full year total 4740. the dpc further reveals that it was notified of 38 personal data breaches involving 11 multinational technology companies during the post-gdpr period of 2018. which means breaches involving tech giants. “a substantial number of these notifications involved the unauthorised disclosure of, and unauthorised access to, personal data as a result of bugs in software supplied by data processors engaged by the organisations,” it writes, saying it opened several investigations as a result (such as following the facebook token breach in september 2018). open probes of tech giants as of 31 december 2018, the dpc says it had 15 investigations open in relation to multinational tech companies’ compliance with gdpr. below is the full list of the dpc’s currently open investigations of multinationals — including the tech giant under scrutiny; the origin of the inquiry; and the issues being examined: facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “right of access and data portability. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the right of access to personal data in the facebook ‘hive’ database and portability of “observed” personal data” facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to facebook’s terms of service and data policy. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the facebook platform.” facebook ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining whether facebook ireland has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining facebook’s compliance with the gdpr’s breach notification obligations.” facebook inc. — own-volition inquiry: “facebook september 2018 token breach. examining whether facebook inc. has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organizational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” facebook ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “commenced in response to large number of breaches notified to the dpc during the period since 25 may 2018 (separate to the token breach). examining whether facebook has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” instagram (facebook ireland limited) — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to instagram’s terms of use and data policy. examining whether instagram has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the instagram platform.” whatsapp ireland limited — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing in relation to whatsapp’s terms of service and privacy policy. examining whether whatsapp has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data of individuals using the whatsapp platform.” whatsapp ireland limited — own-volition inquiry: “transparency. examining whether whatsapp has discharged its gdpr transparency obligations with regard to the provision of information and the transparency of that information to both users and non-users of whatsapp’s services, including information provided to data subjects about the processing of information between whatsapp and other facebook companies.” twitter international company — complaint-based inquiry: “right of access. examining whether twitter has discharged its obligations in respect of the right of access to links accessed on twitter.” twitter international company — own-volition inquiry: “commenced in response to the large number of breaches notified to the dpc during the period since 25 may 2018. examining whether twitter has discharged its gdpr obligations to implement organisational and technical measures to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users.” linkedin ireland unlimited company — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether linkedin has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” apple distribution international — complaint-based inquiry: “lawful basis for processing. examining whether apple has discharged its gdpr obligations in respect of the lawful basis on which it relies to process personal data in the context of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on its platform.” apple distribution international — complaint-based inquiry: “transparency. examining whether apple has discharged its gdpr transparency obligations in respect of the information contained in its privacy policy and online documents regarding the processing of personal data of users of its services.” “the dpc’s role in supervising the data-processing operations of the numerous large data-rich multinational companies — including technology internet and social media companies — with eu headquarters located in ireland changed immeasurably on 25 may 2018,” the watchdog acknowledges. “for many, including apple, facebook, microsoft, twitter, dropbox, airbnb, linkedin, oath [disclosure: techcrunch is owned by verizon media group; aka oath/aol], whatsapp, mtch technology and yelp, the dpc acts as lead supervisory authority under the gdpr oss [one-stop shop] facility.” the dpc notes in the report that between may 25 and december 31 2018 it received 136 cross-border processing complaints through the regulation’s oss mechanism (i.e. which had been lodged by individuals with other eu data protection authorities). a breakdown of these (likely) tech giant focused gdpr complaints shows a strong focus on consent, right of erasure, right of access and the lawfulness of data processing: breakdown of cross-border complaint types received by the dpc under gdpr’s oss mechanism while the irish dpc acts as the lead supervisor for many high profile gdpr complaints which relate to how tech giants are handling people’s data, it’s worth emphasizing that the oss mechanism does not mean ireland is sitting in sole judgement on silicon valley’s giants’ rights incursions in europe. the mechanism allows for other dpas to be involved in these cross-border complaints. and the european data protection board, the body that works with all the eu member states’ dpas to help ensure consistent application of the regulation, can trigger a dispute resolution process if a lead agency considers it cannot implement a concerned agency objection. the aim is to work against forum shopping. in a section on “eu cooperation”, the dpc further writes: our fellow eu regulators, alongside whom we sit on the european data protection board (edpb), follow the activities and results of the irish dpc closely, given that a significant number of people in every eu member state are potentially impacted by processing activities of the internet companies located in ireland. edpb activity is intense, with monthly plenary meetings and a new system of online data sharing in relation to cross-border processing cases rolled out between the authorities. the dpc has led on the development of edpb guidance on arrangements for codes of conduct under the gdpr and these should be approved and published by the edpb in q1 of 2019. the dpc looks forward to industry embracing codes of conduct and raising the bar in individual sectors in terms of standards of data protection and transparency. codes of conduct are important because they will more comprehensively reflect the context and reality of data-processing activities in a given sector and provide clarity to those who sign up to the standards that need to be attained in addition to external monitoring by an independent body. it is clarity of standards that will drive real results. over the reported period the watchdog also reveals that it issued 23 formal requests seeking detailed information on compliance with various aspects of the gdpr from tech giants, noting too that since may 25 it has engaged with platforms on “a broad range of issues” — citing the following examples to give a flavor of these concerns: google on the processing of location data facebook on issues such as the transfer of personal data from third-party apps to facebook and facebook’s collaboration with external researchers microsoft on the processing of telemetry data collected by its office product whatsapp on matters relating to the sharing of personal data with other facebook companies “supervision engagement with these companies on the matters outlined is ongoing,” the dpc adds of these issues. adtech sector “must comply” with gdpr  talking of ongoing action, a gdpr complaint related to the security of personal data that’s systematically processed to power behavioral advertising is another open complaint on the dpc’s desk. the strategic complaint was filed by a number of individuals in multiple eu countries (including ireland) last fall. since then the individuals behind the complaints have continued to submit and publish evidence they argue bolsters their case against the behavioral ad targeting industry (principally google and the iab which set the spec involved in the real-time bidding (rtb) system). the irish dpc makes reference to this rtb complaint in the annual report, giving the adtech industry what amounts to a written warning that while the advertising ecosystem is “complex”, with multiple parties involved in “high-speed, voluminous transactions” related to bidding for ad space and serving ad content “the protection of personal data is a prerequisite to the processing of any personal data within this ecosystem and ultimately the sector must comply with the standards set down by the gdpr”. the watchdog also reports that it has engaged with “several stakeholders, including publishers and data brokers on one side, and privacy advocates and affected individuals on the other”, vis-a-vis the rtb complaint, and says it will continue prioritizing its scrutiny of the sector in 2019 — “in cooperation with its counterparts at eu level so as to ensure a consistent approach across all eu member states”. it goes on to say that some of its 15 open investigations into tech giants will both conclude this year and “contribute to answering some of the questions relating to this complex area”. so, tl;dr, watch this space. responding to the dpc’s comments on the rtb complaint, dr johnny ryan, chief policy and industrial relations officer of private browser brave — and also one of the complainants — told us they expect the dpc to act “urgently”. “we have brought our complaint before the dpc and other european regulators because there is a dire need to fix adtech so that it’s works safely,” he told techcrunch. “the dpc itself recognizes that online advertising is a priority. the iab and google online ‘ad auction’ system enables companies to broadcast what every single person online reads, watches, and listens to online to countless parties. there is no control over what happens to these data. the evidence that we have submitted to the dpc shows that this occurs hundreds of billions of times a day.” “in view of the upcoming european elections, it is particularly troubling that the iab and google’s systems permit voters to be profiled in this way,” he added. “clearly, this infringes the security and integrity principles of the gdpr, and we expect the dpc to act urgently.” the iab has previously rejected the complaints as “false”, arguing any security risk is “theoretical”; while google has said it has policies in place to prohibit advertisers from targeting sensitive categories of data. but the rtb complaint itself pivots on gdpr’s security requirements which demand that personal data be processed in a manner that “ensures appropriate security”, including “protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss”. so the security of the rtb system is the core issue which the irish dpc, along with agencies in the uk and poland, will have to grapple with as a priority this year. the complainants have also said they intend to file additional complaints in more markets across europe, so more dpas are likely to join the scrutiny of rtb, as concerned supervisory agencies, which could increase pressure on the irish dpc to act. schrems ii vs facebook  the watchdog’s report also includes an update on long-running litigation filed by european privacy campaigner max schrems concerning a data transfer mechanism known as standard contractual clauses (sccs) — and originally only targeted at facebook’s use of the mechanism. the dpc decided to refer schrems’ original challenge to the irish courts — which have since widened the action by referring a series of legal questions up to the eu’s top court with (now) potential implications for the legality of the eu’s ‘flagship’ privacy shield data transfer mechanism. that was negotiated following the demise of its predecessor safe harbor, in 2015, also via a schrems legal challenge, going on to launch in august 2016 — despite ongoing concerns from data experts. privacy shield is now used by close to 4,500 companies to authorize transfers of eu users’ personal data to the us. so while schrems’ complaint about sccs (sometimes also called “model contract clauses”) was targeted at facebook’s use of them the litigation could end up having major implications for very many more companies if privacy shield itself comes unstuck. more recently facebook has sought to block the irish judges’ referral of legal questions to the court of justice of the eu (cjeu) — winning leave to appeal last summer (though judges did not stay the referral in the meanwhile). in its report the dpc notes that the substantive hearing of facebook’s appeal took place over january 21, 22 and 23 before a five judge supreme court panel. “oral arguments were made on behalf of facebook, the dpc, the u.s. government and mr schrems,” it writes. “some of the central questions arising from the appeal include the following: can the supreme court revisit the facts found by the high court relating to us law? (this arises from allegations by facebook and the us government that the high court judgment, which underpins the reference made to the cjeu, contains various factual errors concerning us law). “if the supreme court considers that it may do so, further questions will then arise for the court as to whether there are in fact errors in the judgment and if so, whether and how these should be addressed.” “at the time of going to print there is no indication as to when the supreme court judgment will be delivered,” it adds. “in the meantime, the high court’s reference to the cjeu remains valid and is pending before the cjeu.”"
"linkedin’s china site looks and functions just like linkedin everywhere else, except now it asks users in the country to verify their identities through phone numbers. the american company is requiring both new and existing users with a chinese ip address to link mobile phone numbers to their accounts, techcrunch noticed this week. linkedin had for months told its china-based users to provide mobile number details before sending them to the main page, but it had mercifully kept a little “skip” button that let users avoid the fuss — until at least last week. “the real-name verification process for our linkedin china members is a legal requirement, which will also help improve the authenticity and credibility of online accounts,” a linkedin china spokesperson wrote back to techcrunch in an email without addressing whether the process is new. the spokesperson also links the policy to china’s burgeoning mobile industry: “considering the growing popularity of mobile devices and mobile internet, chinese internet users are adapted to registration with mobile phone numbers instead of email addresses. almost all apps in the chinese market are applying this trend to follow users’ habits.” linkedin users with a chinese ip address are greeted with an identity check tied to phone numbers. screenshot: techcrunch in a note visible to china-based users only, linkedin explains that its identity check is a response to local regulations: in some countries, local laws require that we confirm your identity before letting you engage with our services. you must provide a mobile number and confirm receipt of our text. this phone number will be associated with your account and is accessible from your settings. if you choose to change or delete your confirmed mobile number your ability to access our services in certain countries (e.g. china) will be blocked until you once again confirm your identity. the california-based social network for professionals is a rare existence in china, where most mainstream global tech services like facebook and google have long remained blocked. exceptions happen when foreign players bend to local rules. microsoft’s bing is accessible in china by censoring search results. google also reportedly mulled a censored search service to re-enter china, an attempt that outraged its staff, politicians and speech advocates. linkedin, which launched in china back in 2014, also hires so-called “information auditors” to keep close tabs on what users say and share in its china realm, according to a job post the firm listed on a local recruiting site. like google, linkedin caught flack for censoring content. real identity digital anonymity came to an end in china — at least in theory — when the sweeping cyberspace law took effect in 2017. the rules, which are meant to police information on the web, ordered websites to verify users’ real identities before letting them comment or use other tools, though users can still post with their screen names. large platforms like messenger wechat and twitter -like weibo reacted swiftly by running real-name checks on users. the staple practice is to collect mobile phone numbers, which became a form of id after china introduced a policy in 2010 requiring all buyers, foreign or chinese, to show a piece of identification when they obtain their 11-digit identifiers. google’s rumored search engine for china also asked for users’ phone numbers, according to the intercept, which would make it easier for the government to monitor people’s queries. linkedin’s china office in beijing. photo: linkedin china via weibo linkedin had been able to avoid the inevitable process for months. perhaps the government had gone after the biggies first. after all, linkedin is only a fraction the size of its main rival in china. as of november, linkedin had 13 million monthly installs, while its local peer maimai had 95 monthly installs, data from iresearch shows. both are dwarfed by wechat’s more than 1 billion monthly active users. as with other fledgling industries, laws often lag behind technological development, not to mention the enforcement thereof when the odds are against enterprises. take ride-hailing for example. unlicensed drivers and vehicles were still running on the roads two years after china legalized the sector. when the government steps up oversight, the market is hit by a shortage of drivers. clamping down techcrunch has come to understand that linkedin’s identity enforcement is linked to the latest wave of government crackdowns. “slowly, the chinese communist party has been pushing their collective thumbs down on, not only foreign internet companies but all internet companies. it just so happens that the recent political atmosphere is causing more scrutiny,” a source with insights into the matter told techcrunch, asking not to be named. other websites are also indeed tightening controls over users. many apps that previously allowed third-party logins from platforms like wechat and weibo also recently started collecting users’ phone numbers, several people who experienced the changes told techcrunch. users can still get around linkedin’s real-name verification by switching on their virtual private network, known as vpn, that lets people surf the net from an overseas ip address and circumvent the great firewall, china’s internet censoring machinery. but the practice is becoming more challenging and the stakes are growing. by law, only government-approved providers can set up vpns. in response to regulatory oversight, apple pulled hundreds of vpn apps from its china app store in 2017. more recently, china’s telecoms regulator slapped a 1,000 yuan (around $146) fine on a man for accessing the “international net” through “illegal channels.” the case is one of the few known instances where individuals are punished for using vpns, sending worrying signs to those jumping the wall to surf the unfiltered world wide web."
"accurx, the u.k. startup and entrepreneur first alumni that has developed a messaging service for doctor surgeries, has raised £8.8 million in series a funding, techcrunch has learned. according to multiple sources, london venture capital firm atomico has led the round, with participation from localglobe and ef. we first heard a term sheet had been put on the table as far back as mid-january, while it is thought the investment only closed last week. i also understand the round was highly contested, potentially pushing up accurx’s valuation. one source tells me that accel was in the running but didn’t end up investing. both atomico and accurx declined to comment. co-founded by jacob haddad and laurence bargery, who met and subsequently founded the company at entrepreneur first in 2016, accurx initially set out to develop a data-set and tools to help tackle the problem of inappropriate use of antibiotics, which is a major contributor to the diminishing effectiveness of antibiotics. since then the startup has pivoted to focus on creating a broader communication platform to bring medical teams and patients closer together. (given haddad and bargery’s backgrounds, i dare say that the use of data and machine learning to help improve healthcare delivery is still very much front of mind for the company). as it exists today, accurx’s main product is chain sms, a messaging app for use by doctor surgeries to communicate with patients. it has been designed to support nurses, administration staff and practice managers etc., as well as gps. typical use-cases for chain sms includes sending advice to patients, notifying a patient of normal results, and reminding them to book appointments. all communication is saved back to a patient’s medical record to ensure a more joined up approach than might otherwise happen using arcane communication methods such as telephone calls and sending letters in the post. (somewhat related: this weekend, british health secretary matt hancock has called for the use of pagers for communications within the nhs to be phased out by 2021. the outdated technology costs the u.k. taxpayer-funded health service £6.6m per year, apparently). to that end — and no doubt not gone unnoticed by investors — i gather that chain sms is already in use by 20 percent of gp practices in england, from close to zero when it launched in february 2018. the conventional wisdom is that startups find it difficult to penetrate the nhs, when in practice this is starting to change, whilst gp surgeries, although funded through the nhs, are actually run as independent businesses so arguably easier to sell into. a fun fact: a quick spelunking of companies house records reveals that prominent conservative party politician and former army officer tom tugendhat — who is also the current chairman of the foreign affairs committee and tipped by some to be a possible future pm — is an early investor in accurx. separately, i’m told that wendy tan white, the former ef general partner who recently joined alphabet’s x (formerly google x) as vice president, has also invested as part of this latest round. meanwhile, i understand that recently recruited principal irina haivas led on behalf of atomico. haivas is a former surgeon and former surgical fellow at harvard medical school (yes, you read that correctly!) and has previously worked at healthcare investor gho capital partners."
"in its latest monitoring report of a voluntary code of conduct on illegal hate speech, which platforms including facebook, twitter and youtube signed up to in europe back in 2016, the european commission has said progress is being made on speeding up takedowns but tech firms are still lagging when it comes to providing feedback and transparency around their decisions. tech companies are now assessing 89% of flagged content within 24 hours, with 72% of content deemed to be illegal hate speech being removed, according to the commission — compared to just 40% and 28% respectively when the code was first launched more than two years ago. however it said today that platforms still aren’t giving users enough feedback vis-a-vis reports, and has urged more transparency from platforms — pressing for progress “in the coming months”, warning it could still legislate for a pan-eu regulation if it believes it’s necessary. giving her assessment of how the (still) voluntary code on hate speech takedowns is operating at a press briefing today, commissioner vera jourova said: “the only real gap that remains is transparency and the feedback to users who sent notifications [of hate speech]. “on average about a third of the notifications do not receive a feedback detailing the decision taken. only facebook has a very high standard, sending feedback systematically to all users. so we would like to see progress on this in the coming months. likewise the companies should be more transparent towards the general public about what is happening in their platforms. we would like to see them make more data available about the notices and removals.” “the fight against illegal hate speech online is not over. and we have no signs that such content has decreased on social media platforms,” she added. “let me be very clear: the good results of this monitoring exercise don’t mean the companies are off the hook. we will continue to monitor this very closely and we can always consider additional measures if efforts slow down.” jourova flagged additional steps taken by the commission to support the overarching goal of clearing what she dubbed a “sewage of words” off of online platforms, such as facilitating data-sharing between tech companies and police forces to help investigations and prosecutions of hate speech purveyors move forward. she also noted it continues to provide member states’ justice ministers with briefings on how the voluntary code is operating, warning again: “we always discuss that we will continue but if it slows down or it stops delivering the results we will consider some kind of regulation.” germany passed its own social media hate speech takedown law back in 2016, with the so-called ‘netzdg’ law coming into force in early 2017. the law provides for fines as high as €50m for companies that fail to remove illegal hate speech within 24 hours and has led to social media platforms like facebook to plough greater resource into locally sited moderation teams. while, in the uk, the government announced a plan to legislate around safety and social media last year. although it has yet to publish a white paper setting out the detail of its policy plan. last week a uk parliamentary committee which has been investigating the impacts of social media and screen use among children recommended the government legislate to place a legal ‘duty of care’ on platforms to protect minors. the committee also called for platforms to be more transparent, urging them to provide bona fide researchers with access to high quality anonymized data to allow for robust interrogation of social media’s effects on children and other vulnerable users. debate about the risks and impacts of social media platforms for children has intensified in the uk in recent weeks, following reports of the suicide of a 14 year old schoolgirl — whose father blamed instagram for exposing her to posts encouraging self harm, saying he had no doubt content she’d been exposed to on the platform had helped kill her. during today’s press conference, jourova was asked whether the commission intends to extend the code of conduct on illegal hate speech to other types of content that’s attracting concern, such as bullying and suicide. but she said the executive body is not intending to expand into such areas. she said the commission’s focus remains on addressing content that’s judged illegal under existing european legislation on racism and xenophobia — saying it’s a matter for individual member states to choose to legislate in additional areas if they feel a need. “we are following what the member states are doing because we see… to some extent a fragmented picture of different problems in different countries,” she noted. “we are focusing on what is our obligation to promote the compliance with the european law. which is the framework decision against racism and xenophobia. “but we have the group of experts from the member states, in the so-called internet forum, where we speak about other crimes or sources of hatred online. and we see the determination on the side of the member states to take proactive measures against these matters. so we expect that if there is such a worrying trend in some member state that will address it by means of their national legislation.” “i will always tell you i don’t like the fragmentation of the legal framework, especially when it comes to digital because we are faced with, more or less, the same problems in all the member states,” she added. “but it’s true that when you [take a closer look] you see there are specific issues in the member states, also maybe related with their history or culture, which at some moment the national authorities find necessary to react on by regulation. and the commission is not hindering this process. “this is the sovereign decision of the member states.” four more tech platforms joined the voluntary code of conduct on illegal hate speech last year: — namely google+, instagram, snapchat, dailymotion. while french gaming platform webedia (jeuxvideo.com) also announced their participation today. drilling down into the performance of specific platforms, the commission’s monitoring exercise found that facebook assessed hate speech reports in less than 24 hours in 92.6% of the cases and 5.1% in less than 48 hours. the corresponding performance figures for youtube were 83.8 % and 7.9%; and for twitter 88.3% and 7.3%, respectively. while instagram managed 77.4 % of notifications assessed in less than 24 hours. and google+, which will in any case closes to consumers this april, managed to assess just 60%. in terms of removals, the commission found youtube removed 85.4% of reported content, facebook 82.4% and twitter 43.5% (the latter constituting a slight decrease in performance vs last year). while google+ removed 80.0% of the content and instagram 70.6%. it argues that despite social media platforms removing illegal content “more and more rapidly”, as a result of the code, this has not led to an “over-removal” of content — pointing to variable removal rates as an indication that “the review made by the companies continues to respect freedom of expression”. “removal rates varied depending on the severity of hateful content,” the commission writes. “on average, 85.5% of content calling for murder or violence against specific groups was removed, while content using defamatory words or pictures to name certain groups was removed in 58.5 % of the cases.” “this suggest that the reviewers assess the content scrupulously and with full regard to protected speech,” it adds. it is also crediting the code with helping foster partnerships between civil society organisations, national authorities and tech platforms — on key issues such as awareness raising and education activities."
"announcements that apple has partnered with aetna health insurance on a new app leveraging data from its apple watch and reports that verily — one of the health-focused subsidiaries of google‘s parent company, alphabet — is developing a shoe that can detect weight and movement, indicate increasing momentum around using data from wearables for clinical health applications and treatments. for venture capital investors, the move from apple and alphabet to show new applications for wearable devices is a step in the right direction — and something that’s been long overdue. “as a healthcare provider, we talk a lot about the importance of preventative medicine, but the us healthcare system doesn’t have the right incentives in place to pay for it,” writes cameron sepah, an entrepreneur in residence at trinity ventures. “since large employers largely pay for health care (outside of medicaid and medicare), they usually aren’t incentivized to pay for prevention, since employees don’t stay long enough for them to incur the long-term costs of health behaviors. so most startups in this space end up becoming an expendable wellness perk for companies. however, if an insurer like aetna keeps its members long enough, there’s better alignment for disseminating this app.” sepah sees broader implications for the tie-ups between health insurers and the tech companies making all sorts of devices to detect and diagnose conditions. “most patients’ relationship with their insurer is just getting paper bills/notifications in the mail, with terrible customer satisfaction (nps) across the board,” sepah wrote in an email. “but when there’s a way to build a closer relationship through a device that sits on your wrist, it opens possibilities to partner with other health tech startups that can notify patients when they are having mental health issues before they even recognize it (e.g. mindstrong); or when they should get treatment for hypertension or sleep apnea (e.g. cardiogram); or leverage their data into a digital chronic disease treatment program (e.g. omada health).” apple partners with aetna to launch health app leveraging apple watch data aetna isn’t the first insurer to tie apple watch data to their policies. in september 2018, john hancock launched the vitality program, which also gave users discounts on the latest apple watch if they linked it with john hancock’s app. the company also gave out rewards if users changed their behavior around diet and exercise. in a study conducted by rand europe of 400,000 people in the u.s., the u.k. and south africa, research showed that users who wore an apple watch and participated in the vitality benefits program averaged a 34 percent increase in physical activity compared to patients without the apple watch. it equated to roughly 5 extra days of working out per month. “[it will] be interesting to see how the cvs/apple deal unfolds. personalized health guidance based on a combination of individual medical records and real-time wearable data is a huge and worthy goal,” wrote greg yap, a partner at the venture capital firm, menlo ventures . but, yap wrote, “i’m skeptical their first generation app will have enough data or training to deliver value to a broad population, but we’re likely to see some anecdotal benefits, and i find that worthwhile.” meanwhile, the types of devices that record consumer health information are proliferating — thanks in no small part to verily. with the company reportedly working to co-develop shoes with sensors that monitor users’ movement and weight, according to cnbc, verily is expanding its portfolio of connected devices for health monitoring and management. the company already has a watch that monitors certain patient data — including an fda-approved electrocardiogram — and is developing technologies to track diabetes-related eye disease in patients alongside smart lenses for cataract recovery. it’s part of a broader push from technology companies to tie themselves closer to consumer health as they look to seize a part of the nearly $3 trillion healthcare industry. if more data can be collected from wearable devices (or consumer behavior) and then monitored in a consistent fashion, tech companies ideally could suggest interventions faster and provide lower-cost treatments to help avoid the need for urgent or emergency care. these “top of the funnel” communications and monitoring services from tech companies could conceivably divert users and future healthcare patients into an alternative system that is potentially lower-cost, with more of a focus on outcomes than on the volume of care and number of treatments prescribed. not all physicians are convinced that the use of persistent monitoring will result in better care. dr. john ioannidis, a celebrated professor from stanford university, is skeptical about the utility of monitoring without a better understanding of what the data actually reveals. “information is good for you provided you know what it means. for much of that information we have no clue what it means. we have absolutely no idea what to do with it other than creating more anxiety,” dr. ioannidis said. the goal is to provide personalized guidance where machine learning can be used to identify problems and come up in concert with established therapeutic practices, according to investors who back life sciences startups. “i think startups like omada, livongo, lark, vida, virta, and others, can work and are already working on this overall vision of combining real time and personal historical data to deliver personalized guidance. but to be successful, startups need to be more narrowly focused and deliver improved outcomes and financial benefits right away,” according to yap."
"google assistant is following amazon alexa into vehicles. one of the first products to offer the capability is from anker — just like as one of the first in-vehicle alexa products. called the roav bolt, the device plugs into a 12-volt power port and lets the driver access google assistant through the “ok google” command. once connected to the in-vehicle system through bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable, the product will let drivers play audio, enable navigation, read text, make calls and more. the roav bolt also has two usb ports for recharging devices. i tried the roav viva a year ago and found the system clunky to configure and a pain to use. also, at the time, alexa lacked features that made it compelling to use in a vehicle and the third-party device lacked some functionality, like support for spotify. this time around with google assistant, it’s likely the roav bolt offers enough features to make it more worthwhile for more people. this seems like an easy way to get the power of google into a car. the roav bolt will be available for purchase in february for $49.99."
"twitter’s dark mode is about to get darker. in response to a customer’s complaint that twitter’s dark theme isn’t really black, but more of a blue-ish shade, company ceo jack dorsey replied that’s going to be fixed. though a seemingly minor tweak, dark mode settings for apps have become increasingly popular as a means of conserving battery life on high-end devices and making easier on our eyes the apps we use often for long stretches. the interest in dark themes has grown steadily since twitter first debuted its own “night mode” back in mid-2016. a number of apps now support darker themes, including youtube, google, medium, reddit, wikipedia, instapaper, pocket, imdb, ibooks, kindle, google maps, waze, opera mini and many more. it’s even rumored that the upcoming version of the android os will have a system-wide dark mode setting — something dark mode users have wanted for years. this weekend, the topic made its way to the wall street journal, which made the case for dark modes becoming a standard setting across all apps and devices — not only for ease of use and battery benefits, specifically on oled screens — but also because it may help lessen device addiction, and improve sleep. in other words, having a decent dark mode is no longer just an aesthetic choice like skinning your gmail with a cute photo — it’s an option that has real-world benefits. and for many, a dark mode is now their default. twitter’s dark mode, however, has been on the lighter end of the spectrum. (you can view a screenshot of its dark theme on darkmodelist.com, where you can compare it to others.) the app doesn’t go for a true black, but rather a blue-black shade. that’s being addressed, according to @jack’s tweet. was just talking about this with @kayvz. will fix. — jack (@jack) january 20, 2019 of course, there’s an argument to made here that twitter is overly concerned with tweaking minor product details, as if things like a better dark mode or differently threaded conversations matter that much at a time when the company is facing significant issues with regard to how it handles extremism, harassment, doxing, spam, fake news, flat user growth and more on its platform. (and that its ceo doesn’t seem to have good answers for how it’s handling these issues.) but for those who are on twitter anyway and addicted to browsing the timeline, a “blacker” dark mode will improve their use of the product. neither dorsey, nor twitter itself, has yet shared more information on when we’ll see this update, or which platforms will receive the “black” dark mode first. (reached for comment, twitter couldn’t offer more details.) however, twitter first launched its original dark mode on android, so that may be a place to watch.   update, 2/23/19 is this dark enough for “night mode” twitter? still need to make sure it passes accessibility tests. and we should probably not call it “night mode” because folks have this switched on all day. what should we call it? https://t.co/6w4h8rkx9p — jack (@jack) january 23, 2019"
"in addition to competing for smart speaker market share, google and amazon are also competing for developer mindshare in the voice app ecosystem. on this front, amazon has soared ahead — the number of available voice skills for alexa devices has grown to top 80,000 the company recently announced. according to a new third-party analysis from voicebot, google is trailing that by a wide margin with its own voice apps, called google assistant actions, which total 4,253 in the u.s. as of january 2019. for comparison, 56,750 of amazon alexa’s total 80,000 skills are offered in the u.s. the report notes that the number of google assistant actions have grown 2.5 times over the past year — which is slightly faster growth than seen on amazon alexa, whose skill count grew 2.2 times during the same period. but the total is a much smaller number, so growth percentages may not be as relevant here. in january 2018, there were 1,719 total google assistant actions in the u.s., the report said. in 2017, the number was in the low hundreds in the beginning of the year, and reached 724 by october 2017. voicebot also examined which categories of voice apps were popular on google assistant platforms. it found that three of the 18 categories accounted for more than one-third of all google assistant actions: education & reference; games & fun; and kids & family. the education category topped the list with more than 15 percent of all actions, while games & fun was 11.07 percent and kids & family was 9.29 percent. local and weather were the least popular. on alexa, the top categories differ slightly. though games & fun is popular on google, its alexa equivalent — games & trivia — is the no. 1 most popular category, accounting for 21 percent of all skills. education was second most popular at around 14 percent. it’s interesting that these two top drivers for voice apps are reversed on the two platforms. that could indicate that alexa is seen to be the more “fun” platform, or one that’s more oriented toward use by families and gaming. amazon certainly became aware of the trend toward voice gaming, and fanned the flames by making games the first category it paid developers to work on by way of direct payments. that likely encouraged more developers to enter the space, and subsequently helped boost the number of games — and types of gaming experiences — available for alexa. voicebot’s report rightly raises the question as to whether or not the raw skill count even matters, though. after all, many of the alexa skills offered today are of low quality, or more experimental attempts from developers testing out the platform. others are just fairly basic — the voice app equivalent of third-party flashlight apps for iphone before apple built that feature into ios. for example, there now are a handful of skills that turn on the light on echo speakers so you can have a nightlight by way of the speaker’s blue ring. but even if these early efforts sometimes fall short, it does matter that alexa is the platform developers are thinking about, as it’s an indication of platform commitment and an investment on developers’ part. google, on the other hand, is powering a lot of its assistant’s capabilities itself, leaning heavily on its knowledge base to answer users’ questions, while also leveraging its ability to integrate with google’s larger suite of apps and services, as well as its other platforms, like android. in time, google assistant may challenge alexa further by capitalizing on geographic expansions, but for the time being, alexa is ahead on smart speakers as well as, it now seems, on content."
"less than a year after making a $3 billion investment into the future of virtual reality with the purchase of oculus vr, facebook ceo mark zuckerberg was considering another multi-billion-dollar bet to ensure that his company dominated the vr platform — buying unity, the popular game engine that’s used to build half of all gaming titles. this claim is made in a new book coming out next week, “the history of the future,” by blake harris, which digs deep into the founding story of oculus and the drama surrounding the facebook acquisition, subsequent lawsuits and personal politics of founder palmer luckey. in the early days while he was writing the book, harris worked closely with the facebook pr team and was granted regular interviews with key execs before, as he puts it, his “access came to an end.” harris claims that when researching the book, he gained access to more than 25,000 documents from sources, including a nearly 2,500-word email sent by mark zuckerberg to then-oculus ceo brendan iribe, sheryl sandberg and a half-dozen other facebook leaders detailing his interest in buying unity. techcrunch has not independently verified the contents of the email. the email, dated june 22, 2015, lays out an argument for further prioritizing ar/vr and buying the game engine company. the proposed deal, codenamed “one” according to the book, would have brought one of the world’s most recognizable game developer tool startups into the fold of the internet giant bent on bringing consumers on-board its upcoming vr platform as it looked to ward off competition from other tech giants. unity ceo john riccitiello the potential deal obviously did not end up going through, and since 2015, unity has raised nearly $600 million on a valuation north of $3 billion. a report from cheddar earlier this week noted the company was setting its sights on a 2020 ipo. nevertheless, the email seems to offer rare perspectives into zuckerberg’s thoughts on virtual reality and facebook’s competitive footing. though only parts are referenced in the book, harris has sent techcrunch the full email embedded below: 2015 06 22 mark’s vision by on scribd “we are vulnerable on mobile to google and apple because they make major mobile platforms,” the email reads. “from a timing perspective, we are better off the sooner the next platform becomes ubiquitous and the shorter the time we exist in a primarily mobile world dominated by google and apple. the shorter this time, the less our community is vulnerable to the actions of others. therefore, our goal is not only to win in vr / ar, but also to accelerate its arrival. this is part of my rationale for acquiring companies and increasing investment in them sooner rather than waiting until later to derisk them further.” beyond staking a claim on the vr platform, zuckerberg also frames an argument for owning unity as a means of pushing competitors to support facebook’s other platform services. “if we own unity, then android, windows and ios will all need us to support them on [sic] larger portions of their ecosystems won’t work. while we wouldn’t reject them outright, we will have options for how deeply we support them,” zuckerberg continues. “on the flip side, if someone else buys unity or the leader in any core technology component of this new ecosystem, we risk being taken out of the market completely if that acquirer is hostile and decides not to support us.” though, again, a unity deal never came to fruition, zuckerberg seems to be strongly in favor of the deal going through — though he notes there are clear challenges that could leave their efforts bungled. “going back to the question of whether it is worth investing billions of dollars into unity and other core technology over the next decade, the most difficult aspect to evaluate is that we cannot definitively say that if we do x, we will succeed. there are many major pieces of this ecosystem to assemble and many different ways we could be hobbled. all we know is that this improves our chances to build something great. “given the overall opportunity of strengthening our position in the next major wave of computing, i think it’s a clear call to do everything we can to increase our chances. a few billion dollars is expensive, but we can afford it.” facebook did not comment on the email to techcrunch. a spokesperson, however, did send along a statement about the book: “the book doesn’t get everything right, but what we hope people remember is the future of vr will not be defined by one company, one team, or even one person. this industry was built by a community of pioneers who believed in vr against all odds and that’s the history we celebrate.”"
"as schools continue to look for new ways to cut costs while at the same time reboot their curriculum to better tap new innovations and improved understandings of how children learn, e-learning startups are attracting attention, both from educators and the vcs that fund them to fuel growth. in the latest development, newsela — which has created a platform that packages together different third-party content like primary-source documents, news articles and more to help teachers and students learn about a particular subject, more or less as a replacement for more traditional textbooks — has announced that it has raised $50 million in a series c round of funding led by tcv. the new york-based startup said that it plans to use the money to get more penetration within the schools where it is already being used, as well as continue expanding the subject areas that it covers. the company — which currently focuses primarily on k-12 but does cover other learning environments like english-as-a-second-language courses and adult education — covers mostly social sciences, science and english, but also some math. it currently has more than 20 million students and 1.8 million teachers using its the platform, and says that it has usage already in some 90 percent of all schools in the us. the startup is not talking valuation, but as a rough guide, prior to this, newsela had raised about $38 million and was valued at about $82 million in its previous round, according to pitchbook, with some notable backers already on its cap table, including the chan zuckerberg initiative and kleiner perkins, as well as education-focused funds like owl ventures, reach capital and new schools venture fund. it’s a long way to come for a company that was founded, matthew gross (ceo) and dan cogan-drew (the chief product officer), two educators who cut their teeth working in more traditional environments, including via teach for america. newsela first got its start, as you might guess from the name, aggregating interesting news articles that could be used to supplement learning plans around particular subjects, with a specific focus on “ela” — english and language arts. it was after a year in beta that it started to see that there was potential to expand outside of that focus and into adjacent areas. “we’ve outgrown our name,” gross said. the company, founded in 2012, was born out of the idea that computers — used not just for learning coding, but for doing research and communications — have become a cornerstone of how children get information today in the classroom. broadband penetration in schools is now at over 90 percent (compared to 30 percent when newsela first started). and with many schools in the us already equipping each student with a dedicated laptop, that presented an opportunity to rethink how they could be used to harness a wider and more fluid set of materials than what students might be able to get out of a traditional textbook. the material shift in learning comes at a time when we are tapping the internet as the first port of call for all our information outside the classroom. we carry a library in our pockets, and those in a classroom can use their screens to view the us constitution, a specific work of art, the sequence of battles in the civil war and writings from people at the time, modern takes on what a financial crisis in the past might have indicated, or new scientific discoveries. “we can see an unprecedented opportunity to rethink content,” gross said. “textbooks are being pushed aside, and even where they are still being used, many are no longer making textbooks core curricular purchases.” and the shift to interactive also means that other things can now also be measured. “educators are looking for more engagement in their learning outcomes,” he added. indeed, that has had a big knock-on effect already in the textbook publishing world. just last month, pearson sold its entire k-12 textbook division to a pe firm, nexus capital management, in a fire sale: for $25 million plus $225 million in the form of a vendor note due in the next three to five years, with the understanding that nexus may also sell it (in which case pearson would get a cut). pearson said that it will be focusing its education publishing efforts now on digital. gross estimated to me that the textbook market, however, is a $10 billion business annually in terms of collective budgets that are allocated for buying them, which represents a big market for it — and others looking to replace textbooks, including the publishers themselves — to tackle. the format that newsela follows is flexible depending on what is needed by the customer (the school): it provides a set of materials that are constructed around learning a particular subject. but it doesn’t create the coursework around that: this is left to teachers, departments, schools and districts to build. sometimes a district will provide newsela with a more targeted request of what it would like to see covered, and newsela will build a collection to those parameters, gross told me. that is one area it wants to grow. what newsela does behind the scenes is work with more than 100 different sources that have inked licensing agreements with the startup. the licenses allow newsela to republish content on its own platform, and also rewrite content into five levels that are adaptive to age, reading ability and so on. it’s work that would be very time-consuming, and potentially expensive (or even cost-prohibitive), for individual teachers, schools and districts to do on their own. working with a team of editors, newsela gives educators the assurance that there has been some vetting done to provide accurate and complete sets of materials. “it’s a wild world when they search in a google box,” gross said of the challenges to be able to predict a consistent level of quality in results and resources when people sometimes turn to the internet to build similar bundles of content on their own. all of this comes at a price. there is a free tier of newsela that provides the ability to browse and assign content; create classes and give students access to that content, alongside quizzes and activities. two further paid tiers provide a number of extra features. one, teacher-focused, covers monitoring reading activity and quiz scores, assignment planning, annotations, writing prompts, and more teaching resources. the second aimed at schools and districts adds admin visibility, teacher training, live support, and more customised learning plans. in both paid tiers, newsela does not publicly disclose pricing.  the expansiveness of the platform, and future potential of where it can go, are two reasons why tcv — which has backed the likes of capella education, open english and varsity tutors in the education sector, but also very huge consumer internet startups like airbnb, facebook, linkedin and netflix — was interested in backing newsela. “at tcv we focus on finding transformative edtech companies, and newsela has proven to be a tool that boosts learning outcomes,” said woody marshall, general partner at tcv, in a statement. “our investment will help extend the platform and make it more accessible and even more valuable to students, teachers, and administrators. we are especially excited by the great engagement and feedback that newsela already has with their users.” marshall is joining the board with this round. newsela is far from being the only edtech startup that has tapped money from the vc world to grow. in the k-12 sector alone, others have included byju’s in india, which is now valued at over $4 billion (and just this week appears to have started to raise more money from tencent and general atlantic); classdojo; age of learning; vipkid, and kahoot to expand their businesses amid a surge of interest from students, parents and teachers. at newsela, meanwhile, gross said the startup is hiring and has grown staff 50 percent in the last year, and expects to grow as much again this year. “we might have attracted more interest if we had raised $100 million instead of $50 million,” he said in a comment about what seems to turn people’s heads in the tech world these days, “but we happen to be a very capital efficient business, and we heeded a warning i got early on not to raise more than what you really need. we’re proud of being a fiscally sound business that is also mission driven, and making an impact.” that doesn’t rule out raising more for m&a, he added, or indeed fielding inbound interest themselves: the company has already been approached by interested parties, although he declined to say who. but when you consider that education publishers are all looking for their next move to serve the classroom of the future; and tech companies like google, amazon, apple and microsoft have all made huge plays to court the education sector, the longer-term picture is a bright one for newsela."
"email app spark added collaboration features back in may 2018. and readdle, the company behind the app, is going one step further with a new feature specifically designed to delegate an email to one of your colleagues. while you can already collaborate with your team by sharing emails in spark, the app is still not as powerful as a dedicated shared email client, such as front. but delegation brings spark one step closer to its competitor. you can now treat emails as tasks with a deadline. if you’re a manager, you’re working with a personal assistant or you’re in charge of everyone’s workload, you can now assign a conversation to a person in particular and send a message to add some context. on the other end, your colleague receives the conversation in their spark account, in the “assigned to me” tab. they can then start working on that email together with other team members. as a reminder, spark lets you discuss email threads with your colleagues in a comment area, @-mention your colleague and add attachments and links. when you know what to say, you can create a draft, ask for feedback and collaborate like in google docs. delegation is a bit more powerful than simply sharing an email with a colleague. for instance, you can set a due date and mute the conversation. this way, you can hand-off some work and focus on something else. spark for teams uses a software-as-a-service approach. it’s free for small teams and you have to pay $6.39 to $7.99 per user per month to unlock advanced features, such as unlimited email templates and unlimited delegations. free teams are limited to 10 active delegations at any time."
"no one likes being stalked around the internet by adverts. it’s the uneasy joke you can’t enjoy laughing at. yet vast people-profiling ad businesses have made pots of money off of an unregulated internet by putting surveillance at their core. but what if creepy ads don’t work as claimed? what if all the filthy lucre that’s currently being sunk into the coffers of ad tech giants — and far less visible but no less privacy-trampling data brokers — is literally being sunk, and could both be more honestly and far better spent? case in point: this week digiday reported that the new york times managed to grow its ad revenue after it cut off ad exchanges in europe. the newspaper did this in order to comply with the region’s updated privacy framework, gdpr, which includes a regime of supersized maximum fines. the newspaper business decided it simply didn’t want to take the risk, so first blocked all open-exchange ad buying on its european pages and then nixed behavioral targeting. the result? a significant uptick in ad revenue, according to digiday’s report. “nyt international focused on contextual and geographical targeting for programmatic guaranteed and private marketplace deals and has not seen ad revenues drop as a result, according to jean-christophe demarta, svp for global advertising at new york times international,” it writes. “currently, all the ads running on european pages are direct-sold. although the publisher doesn’t break out exact revenues for europe, demarta said that digital advertising revenue has increased significantly since last may and that has continued into early 2019.” it also quotes demarta summing up the learnings: “the desirability of a brand may be stronger than the targeting capabilities. we have not been impacted from a revenue standpoint, and, on the contrary, our digital advertising business continues to grow nicely.” so while (of course) not every publisher is the nyt, publishers that have or can build brand cachet, and pull in a community of engaged readers, must and should pause for thought — and ask who is the real winner from the notion that digitally served ads must creep on consumers to work? the nyt’s experience puts fresh taint on long-running efforts by tech giants like facebook to press publishers to give up more control and ownership of their audiences by serving and even producing content directly for the third party platforms. (pivot to video anyone?) such efforts benefit platforms because they get to make media businesses dance to their tune. but the self-serving nature of pulling publishers away from their own distribution channels (and content convictions) looks to have an even more bass string to its bow — as a cynical means of weakening the link between publishers and their audiences, thereby risking making them falsely reliant on adtech intermediaries squatting in the middle of the value chain. there are other signs behavioural advertising might be a gigantically self-serving con too. look at non-tracking search engine duckduckgo, for instance, which has been making a profit by serving keyword-based ads and not profiling users since 2014, all the while continuing to grow usage — and doing so in a market that’s dominated by search giant google. ddg recently took in $10m in vc funding from a pension fund that believes there’s an inflection point in the online privacy story. these investors are also displaying strong conviction in the soundness of the underlying (non-creepy) ad business, again despite the overbearing presence of google. meanwhile, internet users continue to express widespread fear and loathing of the ad tech industry’s bandwidth- and data-sucking practices by running into the arms of ad blockers. figures for usage of ad blocking tools step up each year, with between a quarter and a third of u.s. connected device users’ estimated to be blocking ads as of 2018 (rates are higher among younger users). ad blocking firm eyeo, maker of the popular adblock plus product, has achieved such a position of leverage that it gets google et al to pay it to have their ads whitelisted by default — under its self-styled ‘acceptable ads’ program. (though no one will say how much they’re paying to circumvent default ad blocks.) so the creepy ad tech industry is not above paying other third parties for continued — and, at this point, doubly grubby (given the ad blocking context) — access to eyeballs. does that sound even slightly like a functional market? in recent years expressions of disgust and displeasure have also been coming from the ad spending side too — triggered by brand-denting scandals attached to the hateful stuff algorithms have been serving shiny marketing messages alongside. you don’t even have to be worried about what this stuff might be doing to democracy to be a concerned advertiser. fast moving consumer goods giants unilever and procter & gamble are two big spenders which have expressed concerns. the former threatened to pull ad spend if social network giants didn’t clean up their act and prevent their platforms algorithmically accelerating hateful and divisive content. while the latter has been actively reevaluating its marketing spending — taking a closer look at what digital actually does for it. and last march adweek reported it had slashed $200m from its digital ad budget yet had seen a boost in its reach of 10 per cent, reinvesting the money into areas with “‘media reach’ including television, audio and ecommerce”. the company’s cmo, marc pritchard, declined to name which companies it had pulled ads from but in a speech at an industry conference he said it had reduced spending “with several big players” by 20 per cent to 50 per cent, and still its ad business grew. so chalk up another tale of reduced reliance on targeted ads yielding unexpected business uplift. at the same time, academics are digging into the opaquely shrouded question of who really benefits from behavioral advertising. and perhaps getting closer to an answer. last fall, at an ftc hearing on the economics of big data and personal information, carnegie mellon university professor of it and public policy, alessandro acquisti, teased a piece of yet to be published research — working with a large u.s. publisher that provided the researchers with millions of transactions to study. acquisti said the research showed that behaviourally targeted advertising had increased the publisher’s revenue but only marginally. at the same time they found that marketers were having to pay orders of magnitude more to buy these targeted ads, despite the minuscule additional revenue they generated for the publisher. “what we found was that, yes, advertising with cookies — so targeted advertising — did increase revenues — but by a tiny amount. four per cent. in absolute terms the increase in revenues was $0.000008 per advertisment,” acquisti told the hearing. “simultaneously we were running a study, as merchants, buying ads with a different degree of targeting. and we found that for the merchants sometimes buying targeted ads over untargeted ads can be 500% times as expensive.” “how is it possible that for merchants the cost of targeting ads is so much higher whereas for publishers the return on increased revenues for targeted ads is just 4%,” he wondered, posing a question that publishers should really be asking themselves — given, in this example, they’re the ones doing the dirty work of snooping on (and selling out) their readers. acquisti also made the point that a lack of data protection creates economic winners and losers, arguing this is unavoidable — and thus qualifying the oft-parroted tech industry lobby line that privacy regulation is a bad idea because it would benefit an already dominant group of players. the rebuttal is that a lack of privacy rules also does that. and that’s exactly where we are now. “there is a sort of magical thinking happening when it comes to targeted advertising [that claims] everyone benefits from this,” acquisti continued. “now at first glance this seems plausible. the problem is that upon further inspection you find there is very little empirical validation of these claims… what i’m saying is that we actually don’t know very well to which these claims are true and false. and this is a pretty big problem because so many of these claims are accepted uncritically.” there’s clearly far more research that needs to be done to robustly interrogate the effectiveness of targeted ads against platform claims and vs more vanilla types of advertising (i.e. which don’t demand reams of personal data to function). but the fact that robust research hasn’t been done is itself interesting. acquisti noted the difficulty of researching “opaque blackbox” ad exchanges that aren’t at all incentivized to be transparent about what’s going on. also pointing out that facebook has sometimes admitted to having made mistakes that significantly inflated its ad engagement metrics. his wider point is that much current research into the effectiveness of digital ads is problematically narrow and so is exactly missing a broader picture of how consumers might engage with alternative types of less privacy-hostile marketing. in a nutshell, then, the problem is the lack of transparency from ad platforms; and that lack serving the self same opaque giants. but there’s more. critics of the current system point out it relies on mass scale exploitation of personal data to function, and many believe this simply won’t fly under europe’s tough new gdpr framework. they are applying legal pressure via a set of gdpr complaints, filed last fall, that challenge the legality of a fundamental piece of the (current) adtech industry’s architecture: real-time bidding (rtb); arguing the system is fundamentally incompatible with europe’s privacy rules. we covered these complaints last november but the basic argument is that bid requests essentially constitute systematic data breaches because personal data is broadcast widely to solicit potential ad buys and thereby poses an unacceptable security risk — rather than, as gdpr demands, people’s data being handled in a way that “ensures appropriate security”. to spell it out, the contention is the entire behavioral advertising business is illegal because it’s leaking personal data at such vast and systematic scale it cannot possibly comply with eu data protection law. regulators are considering the argument, and courts may follow. but it’s clear adtech systems that have operated in opaque darkness for years, without no worry of major compliance fines, no longer have the luxury of being able to take their architecture as a given. greater legal risk might be catalyst enough to encourage a market shift towards less intrusive targeting; ads that aren’t targeted based on profiles of people synthesized from heaps of personal data but, much like duckduckgo’s contextual ads, are only linked to a real-time interest and a generic location. no creepy personal dossiers necessary. if acquisti’s research is to be believed — and here’s the kicker for facebook et al — there’s little reason to think such ads would be substantially less effective than the vampiric microtargeted variant that facebook founder mark zuckerberg likes to describe as “relevant”. the ‘relevant ads’ badge is of course a self-serving concept which facebook uses to justify creeping on users while also pushing the notion that its people-tracking business inherently generates major extra value for advertisers. but does it really do that? or are advertisers buying into another puffed up fake? facebook isn’t providing access to internal data that could be used to quantify whether its targeted ads are really worth all the extra conjoined cost and risk. while the company’s habit of buying masses of additional data on users, via brokers and other third party sources, makes for a rather strange qualification. suggesting things aren’t quite what you might imagine behind zuckerberg’s drawn curtain. behavioral ad giants are facing growing legal risk on another front. the adtech market has long been referred to as a duopoly, on account of the proportion of digital ad spending that gets sucked up by just two people-profiling giants: google and facebook (the pair accounted for 58% of the market in 2018, according to emarketer data) — and in europe a number of competition regulators have been probing the duopoly. earlier this month the german federal cartel office was reported to be on the brink of partially banning facebook from harvesting personal data from third party providers (including but not limited to some other social services it owns). though an official decision has yet to be handed down. while, in march 2018, the french competition authority published a meaty opinion raising multiple concerns about the online advertising sector — and calling for an overhaul and a rebalancing of transparency obligations to address publisher concerns that dominant platforms aren’t providing access to data about their own content. the ec’s competition commissioner, margrethe vestager, is also taking a closer look at whether data hoarding constitutes a monopoly. and has expressed a view that, rather than breaking companies up in order to control platform monopolies, the better way to go about it in the modern ict era might be by limiting access to data — suggesting another potentially looming legal headwind for personal data-sucking platforms. at the same time, the political risks of social surveillance architectures have become all too clear. whether microtargeted political propaganda works as intended or not is still a question mark. but few would support letting attempts to fiddle elections just go ahead and happen anyway. yet facebook has rushed to normalize what are abnormally hostile uses of its tools; aka the weaponizing of disinformation to further divisive political ends — presenting ‘election security’ as just another day-to-day cost of being in the people farming business. when the ‘cost’ for democracies and societies is anything but normal.  whether or not voters can be manipulated en masse via the medium of targeted ads, the act of targeting itself certainly has an impact — by fragmenting the shared public sphere which civilized societies rely on to drive consensus and compromise. ergo, unregulated social media is inevitably an agent of antisocial change. the solution to technology threatening democracy is far more transparency; so regulating platforms to understand how, why and where data is flowing, and thus get a proper handle on impacts in order to shape desired outcomes. greater transparency also offers a route to begin to address commercial concerns about how the modern adtech market functions. and if and when ad giants are forced to come clean — about how they profile people; where data and value flows; and what their ads actually deliver — you have to wonder what if anything will be left unblemished. people who know they’re being watched alter their behavior. similarly, platforms may find behavioral change enforced upon them, from above and below, when it becomes impossible for everyone else to ignore what they’re doing."
"u.s. smart speaker owners grew 40 percent over 2018 to now reach 66.4 million — or 26.2 percent of the u.s. adult population — according to a new report from voicebot.ai and voicify released this week, which detailed adoption patterns and device market share. the report also reconfirmed amazon echo’s lead, noting the alexa-powered smart speaker grew to a 61 percent market share by the end of last year — well above google home’s 24 percent share. these findings fall roughly in line with other analysts’ reports on smart speaker market share in the u.s. however, because of varying methodology, they don’t all come back with the exact same numbers. for example, in december 2018, emarketer reported the echo had accounted for nearly 67 percent of all u.s. smart speaker sales in 2018. meanwhile, cirp last month put echo further ahead, with a 70 percent share of the installed base in the u.s. though the percentages differ, the overall trend is that amazon echo remains the smart speaker to beat. while on the face of things this appears to be great news for amazon, voicebot’s report did note that google home has been closing the gap with echo in recent months. amazon echo’s share dropped nearly 11 percent over 2018, while google home made up for just over half that decline with a 5.5 percent gain, and “other” devices making up the rest. this latter category, which includes devices like apple’s homepod and sonos one, grew last year to now account for 15 percent of the market. that said, the sonos one has alexa built-in, so it may not be as bad for amazon as the numbers alone seem to indicate. after all, amazon is selling its echo devices at cost or even a loss to snag more market share. the real value over time will be in controlling the ecosystem. the growth in smart speakers is part of a larger trend toward voice computing and smart voice assistants — like siri, bixby and google assistant — which are often accessed on smartphones. a related report from juniper research last month estimated there will be 8 billion digital voice assistants in use by 2023, up from the 2.5 billion in use at the end of 2018. this is due to the increased use of smartphone assistants as well as the smart speaker trend, the firm said. voicebot’s report also saw how being able to access voice assistance on multiple platforms was helping to boost usage numbers. it found that smart speaker owners used their smartphone’s voice assistant more than those who didn’t have a smart speaker in their home. it seems consumers get used to being able to access their voice assistants across platforms — now that siri has made the jump to speakers and alexa to phones, for instance. the full report is available on voicebot.ai’s website here."
"the washington post is reporting that facebook’s row with the ftc could result in fines an order of magnitude larger than any levied against a tech company by the regulatory body before. while the talks appear to be ongoing, the washington post spoke with two people familiar with the situation who said the ftc is negotiating with facebook over a possible “multi-billion dollar fine” — an amount more in line with the ftc’s massive $14.7 billion settlement with volkswagen over emissions cheating in 2016. in 2012, google paid a record-setting $22.5 million to settle with the ftc over its own privacy infractions, an amount that is hardly a drop in the bucket by today’s terms. as we’ve previously reported, an ftc fine around that range — or even a multiple of that amount — would be easily shrugged off by the company, which brought in more than $13 billion in revenues in just one quarter of last year. hitting facebook with fines well beyond the millions is one of the only ways to punish a company so wealthy that paying out millions would be little more than a passing annoyance. when contacted about the state of talks with the ftc, facebook repeated a prior statement on regulatory compliance. “we are cooperating with officials in the us, uk, and beyond,” a facebook spokesperson told techcrunch. “we’ve provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues.” assuming the ftc holds its ground in negotiations over a record-blowing fine against facebook, the company is likely to push back hard in court, putting its vast financial resources to the work of insulating it from meaningful penalties both in the present and future. whether the multi-billion-dollar fine materializes or not, the hefty sum would be a major symbol of facebook’s recent privacy transgressions and the process would likely hold facebook to account with some transparency and reporting measures that could be bruising, even if it didn’t pay up. facebook fears no ftc fine"
"on the heels of news that tiktok has reached 1 billion downloads, the company today is launching a new initiative designed to help inform users about online safety, tiktok’s various privacy settings and other controls they can use within its app, and more. instead of dumping this information in an in-app faq or help documentation, the company will release a series of video tutorials that are meant to be engaging and fun, in order to better resemble the other content on tiktok itself. the safety series, called “you’re in control,” will star tiktok users and make use of popular memes, in-app editing tricks and other effects, just like other tiktok videos do. the videos will appear in the app and be available through the new @tiktoktips account.  the videos will focus on a range of privacy, safety and well-being settings and other safety-related policies. this includes tiktok’s community guidelines, how in-app reporting works, plus other settings for protecting your privacy, how to control comments, settings to manage your screen time and more. they’re not exactly your traditional how-to videos, however. instead, the videos showcase what’s often more serious issues — like being overrun with unwanted messages — in a humorous fashion. for example, in the video about configuring your message controls, angry commenters are depicted as shouting passengers on an airplane while the user is depicted by an overwhelmed flight attendant. “too many dms?,” the video asks. the flight attendant snaps his fingers, which causes most of the passengers to disappear. the scene returns to peace and quiet. it’s a simple enough analogy for tiktok’s younger user base to understand. this is then followed by a screen recording that shows you how to turn off messaging within the tiktok app’s settings. other videos have a similar style. a barking, growling dog is used to demonstrate restricted mode, for instance. a noisy crowd overlooking someone’s shoulder is the intro on the video about using comment controls. another video encourages the use of screen time controls, asking “can’t put your phone down?” and shows someone so wrapped up in their phone they aren’t watching where they’re walking. but the video about the community guidelines is maybe the most cringe-y, as it feels a bit like your parents reminding you to “play nice.” however, it still manages to set a tone for what tiktok wants to promote — a community for “positive vibes” where everyone feels “safe and comfortable.” at launch, there are seven of these short-form videos in the safety series, which will launch in the tiktok app in the u.s. and u.k on wednesday. in time, the company plans to add other tutorials and expand the series across its global markets, it says. of course, tiktok needs more than a series of videos to make its app a safe and welcoming community, the way it desires. it also needs a combination of policies, settings, controls, technology, moderation and more, the company says. and it needs to comply with coppa laws – which it’s basically skirting. that said, a focus on user education is an important aspect to this larger goal — and it stands in stark contrast to how facebook intentionally made its privacy settings so complex and difficult to find and use for so many of its earlier years that people gave up trying. how well tiktok can execute on user privacy and safety as the app grows still remains to be seen. for now, it tends to be talked about as either a wholesome and fun video experience, or an online cesspool filled with hateful content and child predators. it’s an app on the internet, so both versions of this story are likely true. there is no large user-generated content site — even those run by facebook, twitter and youtube — that has figured out how to properly police the hatefulness and evil contained in humanity. but tiktok, at least, takes care not to showcase that content in its main feed — you have to seek it out directly (or train its algorithm by never clicking on anything wholesome). but, so far, tiktok has been better reviewed by child safety advocates than you might expect. for instance, common sense media — a nonprofit that provides unbiased and trusted advice about all sorts of media, including apps — said that the app, used with parental supervision, can be “a kid-friendly experience.” the launch of the video series comes at a time when tiktok’s growth is surging. the app recently surpassed a billion installs across the ios app store and google play, including lite versions and regional variations, but excluding android installs in china, according to data from sensor tower. roughly 25 percent of those installs are from india, the report said. and around 663 million of tiktok’s total installs occurred in 2018, which made the app the no. 4 most downloaded non-game for the year. however, installs alone don’t tell the story of how many people actually use the app or how often. and a chunk of these could be the same user installing the app on multiple devices, or even bots used to push the app up the charts. in addition, parents often download the app their tween or teen is using for monitoring purposes, but don’t engage with the app or its content on a regular basis. below, is a compilation of all the new videos launching today:"
"amazon, dish, comcast and others are hoping to turn super bowl 2019 into a way to show off the potential for their voice technologies and tv integrations. the companies this week have been touting new features and a variety of voice commands that will allow viewers to get prepared for the big game, learn about players and teams, tune into nfl news and highlights, set their recordings and more. in some cases, this may be as simple as asking your tv to tune to the super bowl, record the event or get more information about the game, as is the case with dish. customers can press the button on their dish voice remote, then say to alexa “super bowl” or “super bowl 53” to watch, find information or record the game, the company says. comcast and amazon are taking things further, however. comcast’s xfinity x1 customers can now use their voice remote to get the latest stats, get pre-game news and post-game highlights or even turn on an app that tracks real-time stats on the screen during the big game. for example, x1 customers can say “tom brady vs. jared goff,” “the patriots vs. the rams,” “show me julian edelman,” “show me rams leaders” and other sorts of commands to get stats on teams or to learn about the players. they also can say “super bowl” or “nfl” to be taken to news and highlights, or say “x1 sports app” to launch the stat-tracking feature on their tv screen. smart home users with xfinity home can even turn their lighting to their favorite team’s colors by saying “xfinity home, go patriots!” or “go rams!,” as desired. alexa’s super bowl feature set is more robust, offering the ability to ask for trivia and quizzes, background on the players and teams, stats, jokes and burns, track the odds, get historical data and more. these sorts of questions can range from the basic — like, “where is the super bowl this year?” — to the more complex, like “what is the patriots yards per carry this season?” or “how many times has tom brady been to the super bowl?” you can also ask alexa for a super bowl quiz, fact or past game recaps, in addition to more informational questions. alexa can give you football jokes and “burns,” too. what was surprising was that some of the stat-related questions alexa could answer herself weren’t answered on google home, when asked the same way — for example, the above yards per carry question, and number of super bowls that tom brady has been to. both alexa and google assistant will give you their own opinion on who they want to win, however. google says it’s cheering for the underdog, the rams. alexa says as much as she wants to cheer for the rams, she thinks the patriots will win."
"bixby took centerstage at today’s big samsung ces presser. the company has been pushing to make its smart assistant a kind of connective tissue across devices, and the the fruits of that labor may finally be taking shape this year. third-party partners have been a long promised addition, and the company just announced a pretty big one.  sure google’s pushing its own assistant, but the company will also be bringing some of its top apps to bixby. the list includes gmail, youtube, google maps and google play. the news follows today’s earlier announcement that samsung tvs will be compatible with google assistant by way of google home and other other smart speakers/screens. this move, meanwhile, should offer a bit more legitimacy to a smart assistant that stumbled out of the gate and ultimately had some trouble picking up speed. details about the timing and other implementation have yet to be announced."
"tv makers love to use ces as a launch pad for tvs that they don’t actually expect a ton of people to buy. this year’s “eh, why not?” swing from samsung: a 98-inch 8k qled tv. “wait, is there even anything to watch in 8k yet?” nope, not really. hell, even content natively shot in 4k still isn’t as common as anyone would like. there’s always upscaling (samsung says they’ve built some pretty fancy, machine learning-based upscaling here), but if nearly everything you’re watching is upscaled anyway, you probably would have been better off waiting a few years and saving a small mountain of money. i’m all for being an early adopter, but maybe wait until there’s something to adopt. like the rest of samsung’s 2019 lineup, this model should support bixby (samsung’s voice assistant) and will be controllable via both alexa and google assistant. samsung has yet to disclose a price (we’ll update this post if they drop it somewhere), but their previously announced 85-inch 8k tv costs $15,000 so expect the price on this one to come in somewhere between “lots of money” and “all of the money.”"
"the cnil, the french data protection watchdog, has issued its first gdpr fine of $57 million (€50 million). the regulatory body claims that google has failed to comply with the general data protection regulation (gdpr) when new android users set up a new phone and follow android’s onboarding process. two nonprofit organizations called ‘none of your business’ (noyb) and la quadrature du net had originally filed a complaint back in may 2018 — noyb originally filed a complaint against google and facebook, so let’s see what happens to facebook next. under the gdpr, complaints are transferred to local data protection watchdogs. while google’s european hq is in dublin, the cnil first concluded that the team in dublin doesn’t have the final say when it comes to data processing for new android users — that decision probably happens in mountain view. that’s why the investigation continued in paris. the cnil then concluded that google fails to comply with the gdpr when it comes to transparency and consent. let’s start with the alleged lack of transparency. “essential information, such as the data processing purposes, the data storage periods or the categories of personal data used for the ads personalization, are excessively disseminated across several documents, with buttons and links on which it is required to click to access complementary information,” the regulator writes. for instance, if a user wants to know how their data is processed to personalize ads, it takes 5 or 6 taps. the cnil also says that it’s often too hard to understand how your data is being used — google’s wording is broad and obscure on purpose. second, google’s consent flow doesn’t comply with the gdpr according to the cnil. by default, google really pushes you to sign in or sign up to a google account. the company tells you that your experience will be worse if you don’t have a google account. according to the cnil, google should separate the action of creating an account from the action of setting up a device — consent bundling is illegal under the gdpr. if you choose to sign up to an account, when the company asks you to tick or untick some settings, google doesn’t explain what it means. for instance, when google asks you if you want personalized ads, the company doesn’t tell you that it is talking about many different services, from youtube to google maps and google photos — this isn’t just about your android phone. in addition to that, google doesn’t ask for specific and unambiguous consent when you create an account — the option to opt out of personalized ads is hidden behind a “more options” link. that option is pre-ticked by default (it shouldn’t). finally, by default, google ticks a box that says “i agree to the processing of my information as described above and further explained in the privacy policy” when you create your account. broad consent like this is also forbidden under the gdpr. the cnil also reminds google that nothing has changed since its investigation in september 2018. chairman of noyb max schrems has sent us the following statement: “we are very pleased that for the first time a european data protection authority is using the possibilities of gdpr to punish clear violations of the law. following the introduction of gdpr, we have found that large corporations such as google simply ‘interpret the law differently’ and have often only superficially adapted their products. it is important that the authorities make it clear that simply claiming to be complaint is not enough. we are also pleased that our work to protect fundamental rights is bearing fruit. i would also like to thank our supporters who make our work possible.” update: a google spokesperson has sent us the following statement: “people expect high standards of transparency and control from us. we’re deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the gdpr. we’re studying the decision to determine our next steps.” the case against behavioral advertising is stacking up how a small french privacy ruling could remake adtech for good"
"google is expanding its suite of apps designed for the indian market with today’s launch of a new language-learning app aimed at children, called bolo. the app, which is aimed at elementary school-aged students, leverages technology like google’s speech recognition and text-to-speech to help kids learn to read in both hindi and english. to do so, bolo offers a catalog of 50 stories in hindi and 40 in english, sourced from storyweaver.org.in. the company says it plans to partner with other organizations in the future to expand the story selection. included in the app is a reading buddy, “diya,” who encourages and corrects the child when they read aloud. as kids read, diya can listen and respond with feedback. (google notes all personal information remains on-device to protect kids’ privacy.) diya can also read the text to the child and explain the meaning of english words. as children progress in the app, they’ll be presented with word games that win them in-app rewards and badges to motivate them. the app works offline — a necessity in large parts of india — where internet access is not always available. bolo can be used by multiple children, as well, and will adjust itself to their own reading levels. google says it had been trialing bolo across 200 villages in uttar pradesh, india, with the help of nonprofit aser centre. during testing, it found that 64 percent of children who used the app showed an improvement in reading proficiency in three months’ time. to run the pilot, 920 children were given the app and 600 were in a control group without the app, google says. in addition to improving their proficiency, more students in the group with the app (39 percent) reached the highest level of aser’s reading assessment than those without it (28 percent), and parents also reported improvements in their children’s reading abilities. illiteracy remains a problem in india. the country has one of the largest illiterate populations in the world, where only 74 percent are able to read, according to a study by aser centre a few years back. it found then that more than half of students in fifth grade in rural state schools could not read second-grade textbooks in 2014. by 2018, that figure hadn’t changed much — still, only about half can read at a second-grade level, aser now reports. while google today highlights its philanthropic efforts in education, it’s worth noting that google’s interest in helping improve india’s literacy metrics benefits its bottom line, too. as the country continues to come online to become one of the largest internet markets in the world, literate users capable of using google’s products like search, ads, gmail and others are of increased importance to google’s business. already, google has shipped a number of applications designed specifically for indian internet users, like data-friendly versions of youtube, search and other popular services, like payments app tez (now rebranded google pay), a food delivery service, a neighborhood and communities networking app, a blogging app and more. today, bolo is launching across india as an open beta, while google will continue to work with its nonprofit partners — including pratham education foundation, room to read, saajha and kaivalya education foundation — a piramal initiative — to bring the app to more children. bolo is available now on the google play store in india, and works on android smartphones running android 4.4 (kit kat) and higher. the app is currently optimized for native hindi speakers."
"augmented reality looked like it was supposed to a ubiquitous success; apple and google and facebook seemed to say so. but things are taking a bit of time to get kicked off, so the startups in the space are having to get real weird with it. adventurous is an augmented reality scavenger hunt geared toward families, but it drags in enough elements of the real world to make it a pretty robust experience. this isn’t your typical ar phone app that you pop open once. for one thing, you have to be at a certain physical location in order to try it out, you have to make an appointment and, oh yeah, there are live actors involved. this may be one of the more odd companies in y combinator’s latest startup batch — it’s basically a kind of tech-enabled live theater. the company’s co-founders acknowledge that having appointments and live actors involved with an app isn’t the most scalable business model in internet history, but they say they’ll figure stuff out as they move along, and that for now the families and kids involved really like the experience. “we know that families are constantly looking for stuff to do with their kids, and not all screen time is good screen time,” adventurous co-founder jeany ngo tells techcrunch. adventurous co-founders jeany ngo and brian schulman when a family or group books an adventure, they meet at a designated location at a given time and get a rundown on the mission and story from actors in full dress and character, then they’re tasked with walking around to different physical locations where different geo-tagged experiences will pop up on their arkit or arcore-enabled phone and they’ll have to complete the tasks to move on. the experiences are designed to be around 45 minutes to 1 hour each and the whole shebang costs $15 per person. one of the big selling points of augmented reality as a medium is that it can theoretically gain an understanding of a location’s geometry and plunk down digital content in a way that’s tailored to your space. that may be true for something like google’s ar stickers, where it’s a little stationary 3d model, but when you start talking about actual story lines, the fact is that computer vision just can’t make reliable sense of a dynamic environment when it comes to a game or experience. suns out foxes out! enjoy the sunny day and help the foxes bring peace to the neighborhood with our latest adventure! download the app at https://t.co/frtxrnkmfa! pic.twitter.com/inbgtvtknd — adventurous co (@adventurousco) february 18, 2019 the company has been testing various locations for their ar adventures; right now they’re sticking with missions in san francisco’s chinatown and golden gate park. it’s a little unclear whether there could be any associated legal issues for a startup tying digital experiences to physical public locations, but the co-founders say they haven’t run in to any issues yet. with adventurous, the startup is banking on the robustness of an ironed-out experience to suck in fans and bring them back. the company’s co-founders foresee a world where narratives fit together like episodes in a tv series, bringing families back to book appointments to see what happens next. location-based entertainment has been a hit-or-miss vertical for the vr industry, though some startups have seen success. sandbox vr finished out a $68 million series b earlier this year in a round led by a16z. for ar startups, there haven’t been too many stories of entertainment experiences that have been strictly tied to geographic areas outside of event activations. while you can find pokéstops inside pokémon go, it isn’t a full linear experience that requires everyone to move along an identical path. adventurous is live now. if you’re in sf, you can book yourself a fancy scavenger hunt in augmented reality this weekend."
"the daily crunch is techcrunch’s roundup of our biggest and most important stories. if you’d like to get this delivered to your inbox every day at around 9am pacific, you can subscribe here. 1. pinterest files confidentially to go public the business has confidentially submitted paperwork to the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering slated for later this year, according to a report from the wall street journal. earlier reports indicated the company was planning to debut on the stock market in april. in late january, pinterest took its first official step toward a 2019 ipo, hiring goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase as lead underwriters for its offering. 2. google ends forced arbitration for employees this is a direct response to a group of outspoken google employees protesting the company’s arbitration practices. forced arbitration ensures that workplace disputes are settled behind closed doors and without any right to an appeal, effectively preventing employees from suing companies. 3. facebook will shut down its spyware vpn app onavo facebook will end its unpaid market research programs and proactively take its onavo vpn app off the google play store in the wake of backlash following techcrunch’s investigation about onavo code being used in a facebook research app that sucked up data about teens. in this photo taken on february 6, 2019, indian delivery men working with the food delivery apps uber eats and swiggy wait to pick up an order outside a restaurant in mumbai. 4. uber is reportedly close to making a tactical exit from india’s food delivery industry india’s economic times is reporting that uber is in the final stages of a deal that would see swiggy eat up uber eats in india in exchange for giving the u.s. ride-hailing firm a 10 percent share of its business. 5. google’s ‘digital wellbeing’ features hit more devices, including samsung galaxy s10 initially available exclusively to pixel and android one device owners, digital wellbeing’s feature set is now rolling out to nokia 6 and nokia 8 devices with android pie, as well as on the new samsung galaxy s10. 6. doordash raises $400m round, now valued at $7.1b recent data from second measure shows that doordash has overtaken uber eats in u.s. market share — for online food delivery, it now comes in second to grubhub. 7. venmo launches a ‘limited edition’ rainbow debit card for its payment app users the new rainbow card will be offered until supplies last, venmo says. and existing card holders can request this card as a replacement for their current card, if they choose."
"entrepreneur first (ef), the london-headquartered “talent investor” that recruits and backs individuals pre-team and pre-idea to enable them to found startups, has raised a new fund of its own to continue scaling globally. the $115 million first close was led by a number of leading (mostly unnamed) institutional investors across the u.s., europe and asia, including new anchor lp trusted insight. a number of well-known european entrepreneurs also invested. they include taavet hinrikus (co-founder of transferwise), alex chesterman (co-founder of zoopla) and ef alumnus rob bishop (who co-founded magic pony technology, which was bought by twitter for a reported $150 million in 2016). this new fund — which ef says is one the largest pre-seed funds ever raised — will enable the talent investor to back more than 2,200 individuals who join its various programs over the next three years. ef currently operates in bangalore, berlin, hong kong, london, singapore and paris. this will translate to the creation of around 300-plus venture-backed companies, three times the number of startups it has helped create since ef was founded by mckinsey colleagues matt clifford and alice bentinck all the way back in 2011. as part of the same announcement, ef says that general partner joe white has relocated to silicon valley, where he’ll focus on growing ef’s investor network on the west coast. perhaps the move shouldn’t come as a total surprise — white is the husband of wendy tan white, who was recently recruited by alphabet’s x (formerly google x) in mountain view — but either way it feels like a smart move from ef’s perspective, as the talent investor, which is also backed by reid hoffman’s greylock, seeks to create further ties to silicon valley. comments co-founder and cpo bentinck: “we pioneered a new model of talent investing, and it’s encouraging to see this become a new frontier for venture capital. we believe the world is missing out on some of its best founders because of ecosystem constraints, a lack of co-founders and difficulties getting early pre-company funding. entrepreneur first is changing that.” ef is also sharing some data with techcrunch, revealing for the first time numbers related to the number of ef graduating startups that have gone on to raise outside capital. for the 2015 “vintage” cohort, there were 16 seed rounds, eight series as and now two series bs. for 2016, 24 seeds and five a rounds so far. for 2017, 41 seeds and two a rounds. and for 2018, 57 seeds and one series a already. a slide thought to be from ef’s recent lp pitch deck “the graph shows the volume of ef companies funded by vcs each year since 2015 (e.g. only those that raise a successful seed, not just those funded by ef),” white tells me. “the average age to series a is 40 months according to pitchbook, or 60 months to series b. many of our companies are already ahead of that schedule, but many more will reach these milestones in the next 12 months.” below follows an email q&a with ef co-founder matt clifford to find out more about the new fund and where it positions the so-called talent investor going forward. tc: you’ve announced the first close of a new fund — $115 million. what is the remit for the fund and how does it fit into the broader ef program and funnel? is it mainly for follow-on funding so ef doesn’t get too diluted for the most promising companies it helps create? mc: the main thing we’re doing with this fund is taking our talent investing model global. we’ve always said the world’s missing out on some of its best founders and now we’ve got the capital to change that. it’s true it’s a lot bigger than our last fund, but that’s mainly driven by scaling internationally, not by a change in investment strategy. this fund will do stipends, pre-seed, seed and series a investing in all our companies globally. it gives us capacity to fund 2,000 individuals around the world over the next three years. we’ll absolutely be backing the best entrepreneur first companies up to their series a, but we’ve been doing that since 2016, so no change there. tc: an earlier sec filing suggested the fund was going to be much bigger. what happened? mc: as far as i know, you have to file the hard cap with the sec, but that’s not a target. this is a first close, not a final close, but with $115 million we can fully fund all six sites for three years, which is great. tc: like previous ef funds, the new fund’s lps include many known founders and angel investors from the london tech scene and beyond. but this time around i gather you have some quite large institutional lps, too, including from the u.s. how were those conversations different this time or was it simply the reid hoffman effect after greylock partners became an investor in ef itself? mc: yes, this is definitely a “growing up” fund for us. our first “fund” in 2013 was under £400k, so a lot’s changed! almost all this capital comes from institutional lps and they include some of the best investors in venture capital funds globally. ef is a totally new stage of vc – talent investing – and lps are quite rightly naturally fairly conservative. so joe and i and the rest of the team have put in a lot of work to get institutions comfortable with something radically different and we feel it’s really paid off. certainly having reid and others involved has helped a lot, but ef is just generally a very different beast from when we closed the last fund: the portfolio is now valued at well over $1.3 billion; we’ve had $300 million of exits; the fastest growing alumni companies have been funded by some of the best vcs in europe and the us, etc. so across the board we had a lot more to show. tc: ef began life calling itself a “talent-first” investor based on the ef program recruiting potential founders pre-team and pre-idea, which made you an outlier at the time. in that sense, you were — and i hesitate to use the word — ‘disrupting’ startup founding and traditional career paths. but now it’s starting to look like the ef model is a ruse to disrupt early-stage venture capital… or is that too simple an analysis? mc: haha! alice and i are still much more interested in disrupting careers than disrupting vc. what i would say is that we believe we’re heading for a world where many more of the most talented people will become founders and most of those people won’t be in established tech ecosystems. we think that makes the opportunity hard to capture for traditional vc, because it assumes away the real problems – above all, where to find a world-class co-founder. but we’re very much ecosystem players. i think we’ve now co-invested with pretty much every seed fund in europe and se asia and i think they’d all tell you we play nice. tc: it’s been reported that in a bid to expand globally, ef has come up against scaling issues with regards to matching founders and company formation. i’ve heard from my own sources that there were teething problems in berlin, for example. what’s really going on? mc: it’s definitely the conventional wisdom that vc isn’t scaleable, but i think we’re proving that wrong. if you take our core metric of co-founder matching, our most recent european cohorts had the highest matching rate so far – over 80% of people who joined us found a co-founder (though of course we don’t fund every team that forms). similarly if you look at our first paris cohort, it has one of the highest investment rates of any cohort we’ve ever done (and we’ve done 21 cohorts so far). honestly, we’re really happy with the way the international expansion went, though i’d be the first to say that scaling is hard and we’ll make mistakes! tc: we’ve seen a few ef clones appear. sincerest form of flattery or blatant opportunism? and which, if any, part of ef is defensible? mc: i always remember paul graham being asked this about yc clones and saying he felt “like how jk rowling would feel if someone wrote a book called henry potter.” joking aside though, i think yc has shown that highly defensible network effects in vc are possible. there are literally hundreds of yc clones and yet 95% of the value in accelerators has accrued to yc. i think we’re on track for something similar in the talent investing space. the key way to think about defensibility is at the level of the customer – i.e. the founder. which talent investor do you want to join? you want to join the one with the highest quality potential co-founders. which one has that? well, unsurprisingly, the one with the track record, the best alum, the best network, etc. once you’ve established that – and ef is 5 or 6 years ahead of the clones – it’s very difficult to catch up and the advantage compounds quickly. tc: you shared some stats with regards the success rate of ef startups and the figures look encouraging. but what we don’t yet still have are many exits. this isn’t surprising given that you invest incredibly early, so it will take time for startups to move through the cycle, but it also means that lps backing ef continue to take a leap of faith. is that a fair statement and what was the major pushback you got from lps that declined not to join ef on this next phase of your journey? mc: for sure, that’s fair. the numbers look great on paper, but it’s way too early to see significant cash returns. in fact, right now we don’t want more exits, as we want our best companies to keep growing privately for as long as possible. last year, the portfolio raised more money than they had in the history of ef before that put together, so we’re feeling very positive. it’s definitely true that some lps don’t want to invest until you’ve returned a whole fund, but fortunately lots of them put in a lot of time to understand the model and were willing to partner with us for the long-term. this will be a big year for the portfolio – no big exits, i hope, but lots of momentum on revenue, product and funding for sure. tc: lastly, you now have a general partner and ef’s cfo joe white (who i understand was instrumental in helping to raise this new fund) posted to silicon valley, where he’ll be helping to grow ef’s investor network on the west coast. how important is u.s. venture capital to ef’s future and when can we expect to see ef launch a program across the pond? mc: yes, joe and i spent a lot of time on planes and in the u.s. last year to pitch lps! the vast majority of the capital in this fund is u.s.-based and, of course, reid and greylock are there too. what joe, alice and i all believe is that silicon valley remains perhaps the best place in the world to scale a tech company, even if it’s no longer the essential place to start one. this means that being able to build relationships with the best u.s. vcs is a key competitive advantage for an ef company. we’ve already seen some of this, with insight leading tractable’s b round and founders fund leading massless’s (ef ld9) seed. but joe being there full time is an ideal way for us to accelerate this and i think you’ll see a bunch of ef companies raise u.s.-led b and c rounds this year. the key is the right capital at the right time. we’re still thinking hard about our next stage of expansion. it’s hard to see a major need for ef in silicon valley itself, but there may be a big opportunity in other parts of north america. watch this space…"
"google assistant has long been able to do quick, one-off translations — just say something like “hey google, how do i say ‘birthday’ in french?” that doesn’t help much with actual conversations between people who speak different languages. for that, google is building what they call “interpreter mode.” if you speak english and want to have a conversation with someone who primarily speaks french, for example, you would trigger interpreter mode by saying “hey google, be my french interpreter.” from there, the translation happens in both directions. speak english, wait a second, and google home will repeat what you said but in french. when your friend responds, their french will be repeated back as english. it’ll work in 27 languages at launch. interpreter mode will come first to google home speakers and smart displays like the google home hub, the latter of which will also show you the text of your translated conversation on-the-fly. it’ll be a fun trick in the home, but google largely sees this being useful in retail or customer service. a hotel, for example, could place a smart display at the concierge desk, using it to better help their guests from around the world. they’re rolling out a test run in a few different vegas hotels at ces this week and it’ll roll out to everyone else after — though, as google likes to do, they’re not getting super-specific about launch dates."
