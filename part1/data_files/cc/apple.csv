"gm is sprucing up its smartphone app for owners of the all-electric chevrolet bolt through a collaboration with charging network companies evgo, chargepoint and greenlots. the idea is to take aggregate dynamic data from each of the ev charging networks so owners can have a “more seamless charging experience.” in short: gm wants to make it easier and more intuitive for bolt ev owners to find and access charging. removing hurdles from the charging experience can go a long way in convincing more people to buy the bolt ev, or any ev for that matter. the partnership with evgo, chargepoint and greenlots is a notable start considering that collectively that means more than 31,000 charging ports. “gm believes in an all-electric future, and this is a significant step to make charging easier for our customers,” said doug parks, general motors vice president of autonomous and electric vehicle programs. “by collaborating with these three companies, we expect to reduce barriers to create a stronger ev infrastructure for the future. this is an important step toward achieving gm’s vision of a world with zero emissions.” gm plans to take the aggregate charging data from evgo, chargepoint and greenlots and use it to improve the mychevrolet app. for instance, owners will be able to see if a charging station is available and compatible with the bolt ev. it also will provide real-time data on charge stations to report if a charging station is working. gm plans to create an app interface that will streamline the enrollment process for each of these networks. the automaker wants owners to be able to activate a charging session using the app instead of a membership card, but didn’t say when that feature would be rolled out. gm recently made a few updates to the mychevrolet app that lets owners project the energy assist to the vehicle’s infotainment system via apple carplay and android auto for drivers with model year 2017 or newer bolt evs. this means bolt ev drivers can access information through their infotainment system, like vehicle range, charging station locations and search, as well as route planning that takes into consideration charging stops along the way if the destination is out of range. original purchasers of new bolt evs will have access to these features at no additional cost for five years from the vehicle delivery date, according to gm. gm doesn’t provide updates about the bolt ev, and more broadly its electric vehicle program, at the same pace and frequency as say tesla. but the company is still ramping up and expanding. gm recently expanded a battery lab, and a new lg electronics plant in michigan has come online. the lg electronics facility in hazel park started making battery packs this fall to supply gm’s orion assembly plant, where the automaker builds the all-electric chevrolet  bolt. gm’s plan to launch 20 new all-electric vehicles globally by 2023 and increase production of the chevy bolt."
"few issues divide the tech community quite like privacy. much of silicon valley’s wealth has been built on data-driven advertising platforms, and yet, there remain constant concerns about the invasiveness of those platforms. such concerns have intensified in just the last few weeks as france’s privacy regulator placed a record fine on google under europe’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) rules which the company now plans to appeal. yet with global platform usage and service sales continuing to tick up, we asked a panel of eight privacy experts: “has anything fundamentally changed around privacy in tech in 2019? what is the state of privacy and has the outlook changed?”  this week’s participants include: albert gidari – consulting director of privacy at stanford’s center for internet and society; professor at stanford law school gabriel weinberg – ceo and founder of duckduckgo melika carroll -senior vp of global government affairs at the internet association johnny ryan – chief policy and industry relations officer at brave john miller –  vp of global policy and law at the information technology industry council nuala o’connor – president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology chris baker – senior vp and general manager of emea at box christopher wolf – founder and chair of the future privacy forum; senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing on internet law, privacy and data protection policy techcrunch is experimenting with new content forms. consider this a recurring venue for debate, where leading experts – with a diverse range of vantage points and opinions – provide us with thoughts on some of the biggest issues currently in tech, startups and venture. if you have any feedback, please reach out: arman.tabatabai@techcrunch.com. thoughts & responses: albert gidari albert gidari is the consulting director of privacy at the stanford center for internet and society. he was a partner for over 20 years at perkins coie llp, achieving a top-ranking in privacy law by chambers, before retiring to consult with cis on its privacy program. he negotiated the first-ever “privacy by design” consent decree with the federal trade commission. a recognized expert on electronic surveillance law, he brought the first public lawsuit before the foreign intelligence surveillance court, seeking the right of providers to disclose the volume of national security demands received and the number of affected user accounts, ultimately resulting in greater public disclosure of such requests. there is no doubt that the privacy environment changed in 2018 with the passage of california’s consumer privacy act (ccpa), implementation of the european union’s general data protection regulation (gdpr), and new privacy laws enacted around the globe. “while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.”” for one thing, large tech companies have grown huge privacy compliance organizations to meet their new regulatory obligations. for another, the major platforms now are lobbying for passage of a federal privacy law in the u.s. this is not surprising after a year of privacy miscues, breaches and negative privacy news. but does all of this mean a fundamental change is in store for privacy? i think not. the fundamental model sustaining the internet is based upon the exchange of user data for free service. as long as advertising dollars drive the growth of the internet, regulation simply will tinker around the edges, setting sideboards to dictate the terms of the exchange. the tech companies may be more accountable for how they handle data and to whom they disclose it, but the fact is that data will continue to be collected from all manner of people, places and things. indeed, if the past year has shown anything it is that two rules are fundamental: (1) everything that can be connected to the internet will be connected; and (2) everything that can be collected, will be collected, analyzed, used and monetized. it is inexorable. while privacy regulation seeks to make tech companies betters stewards of the data they collect and their practices more transparent, in the end, it is a deception to think that users will have more “privacy.” no one even knows what “more privacy” means. if it means that users will have more control over the data they share, that is laudable but not achievable in a world where people have no idea how many times or with whom they have shared their information already. can you name all the places over your lifetime where you provided your ssn and other identifying information? and given that the largest data collector (and likely least secure) is government, what does control really mean? all this is not to say that privacy regulation is futile. but it is to recognize that nothing proposed today will result in a fundamental shift in privacy policy or provide a panacea of consumer protection. better privacy hygiene and more accountability on the part of tech companies is a good thing, but it doesn’t solve the privacy paradox that those same users who want more privacy broadly share their information with others who are less trustworthy on social media (ask jeff bezos), or that the government hoovers up data at rate that makes tech companies look like pikers (visit a smart city near you). many years ago, i used to practice environmental law. i watched companies strive to comply with new laws intended to control pollution by creating compliance infrastructures and teams aimed at preventing, detecting and deterring violations. today, i see the same thing at the large tech companies – hundreds of employees have been hired to do “privacy” compliance. the language is the same too: cradle to grave privacy documentation of data flows for a product or service; audits and assessments of privacy practices; data mapping; sustainable privacy practices. in short, privacy has become corporatized and industrialized. true, we have cleaner air and cleaner water as a result of environmental law, but we also have made it lawful and built businesses around acceptable levels of pollution. companies still lawfully dump arsenic in the water and belch volatile organic compounds in the air. and we still get environmental catastrophes. so don’t expect today’s “clean privacy law” to eliminate data breaches or profiling or abuses. the privacy world is complicated and few people truly understand the number and variety of companies involved in data collection and processing, and none of them are in congress. the power to fundamentally change the privacy equation is in the hands of the people who use the technology (or choose not to) and in the hands of those who design it, and maybe that’s where it should be. gabriel weinberg gabriel weinberg is the founder and ceo of privacy-focused search engine duckduckgo. coming into 2019, interest in privacy solutions is truly mainstream. there are signs of this everywhere (media, politics, books, etc.) and also in duckduckgo’s growth, which has never been faster. with solid majorities now seeking out private alternatives and other ways to be tracked less online, we expect governments to continue to step up their regulatory scrutiny and for privacy companies like duckduckgo to continue to help more people take back their privacy. “consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information.” we’re also seeing companies take action beyond mere regulatory compliance, reflecting this new majority will of the people and its tangible effect on the market. just this month we’ve seen apple’s tim cook call for stronger privacy regulation and the new york times report strong ad revenue in europe after stopping the use of ad exchanges and behavioral targeting. at its core, this groundswell is driven by the negative effects that stem from the surveillance business model. the percentage of people who have noticed ads following them around the internet, or who have had their data exposed in a breach, or who have had a family member or friend experience some kind of credit card fraud or identity theft issue, reached a boiling point in 2018. on top of that, people learned of the extent to which the big platforms like google and facebook that collect the most data are used to propagate misinformation, discrimination, and polarization. consumers don’t necessarily feel they have anything to hide – but they just don’t want corporations to profit off their personal information, or be manipulated, or unfairly treated through misuse of that information. fortunately, there are alternatives to the surveillance business model and more companies are setting a new standard of trust online by showcasing alternative models. melika carroll melika carroll is senior vice president, global government affairs at internet association, which represents over 45 of the world’s leading internet companies, including google, facebook, amazon, twitter, uber, airbnb and others. we support a modern, national privacy law that provides people meaningful control over the data they provide to companies so they can make the most informed choices about how that data is used, seen, and shared. “any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online.” internet companies believe all americans should have the ability to access, correct, delete, and download the data they provide to companies. americans will benefit most from a federal approach to privacy – as opposed to a patchwork of state laws – that protects their privacy regardless of where they live. if someone in new york is video chatting with their grandmother in florida, they should both benefit from the same privacy protections. it’s also important to consider that all companies – both online and offline – use and collect data. any national privacy framework should provide the same protections for people’s data across industries, regardless of whether it is gathered offline or online. two other important pieces of any federal privacy law include user expectations and the context in which data is shared with third parties. expectations may vary based on a person’s relationship with a company, the service they expect to receive, and the sensitivity of the data they’re sharing. for example, you expect a car rental company to be able to track the location of the rented vehicle that doesn’t get returned. you don’t expect the car rental company to track your real-time location and sell that data to the highest bidder. additionally, the same piece of data can have different sensitivities depending on the context in which it’s used or shared. for example, your name on a business card may not be as sensitive as your name on the sign in sheet at an addiction support group meeting. this is a unique time in washington as there is bipartisan support in both chambers of congress as well as in the administration for a federal privacy law. our industry is committed to working with policymakers and other stakeholders to find an american approach to privacy that protects individuals’ privacy and allows companies to innovate and develop products people love. johnny ryan dr. johnny ryan frhists is chief policy & industry relations officer at brave. his previous roles include head of ecosystem at pagefair, and chief innovation officer of the irish times. he has a phd from the university of cambridge, and is a fellow of the royal historical society. tech companies will probably have to adapt to two privacy trends. “as lawmakers and regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware.” first, the gdpr is emerging as a de facto international standard. in the coming years, the application of gdpr-like laws for commercial use of consumers’ personal data in the eu, britain (post-eu), japan, india, brazil, south korea, malaysia, argentina, and china will bring more than half of global gdp under a similar standard. whether this emerging standard helps or harms united states firms will be determined by whether the united states enacts and actively enforces robust federal privacy laws. unless there is a federal gdpr-like law in the united states, there may be a degree of friction and the potential of isolation for united states companies. however, there is an opportunity in this trend. the united states can assume the global lead by doing two things. first, enact a federal law that borrows from the gdpr, including a comprehensive definition of “personal data”, and robust “purpose specification”. second, invest in world-leading regulation that pursues test cases, and defines practical standards. cutting edge enforcement of common principles-based standards is de facto leadership. second, privacy and antitrust law are moving closer to each other, and might squeeze big tech companies very tightly indeed. big tech companies “cross-use” user data from one part of their business to prop up others. the result is that a company can leverage all the personal information accumulated from its users in one line of business, and for one purpose, to dominate other lines of business too. this is likely to have anti-competitive effects. rather than competing on the merits, the company can enjoy the unfair advantage of massive network effects even though it may be starting from scratch in a new line of business. this stifles competition and hurts innovation and consumer choice. antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions have addressed this. in 2015, the belgian national lottery was fined for re-using personal information acquired through its monopoly for a different, and incompatible, line of business. as lawmakers and regulators in europe and in the united states start to think of “purpose specification” as a tool for anti-trust enforcement, tech giants should beware. john miller john miller is the vp for global policy and law at the information technology industry council (iti), a d.c. based advocate group for the high tech sector.  miller leads iti’s work on cybersecurity, privacy, surveillance, and other technology and digital policy issues. data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike. however, as times change and innovation progresses at a rapid rate, it’s clear the laws protecting consumers’ data and privacy must evolve as well. “data has long been the lifeblood of innovation. and protecting that data remains a priority for individuals, companies and governments alike.” as the global regulatory landscape shifts, there is now widespread agreement among business, government, and consumers that we must modernize our privacy laws, and create an approach to protecting consumer privacy that works in today’s data-driven reality, while still delivering the innovations consumers and businesses demand. more and more, lawmakers and stakeholders acknowledge that an effective privacy regime provides meaningful privacy protections for consumers regardless of where they live. approaches, like the framework iti released last fall, must offer an interoperable solution that can serve as a model for governments worldwide, providing an alternative to a patchwork of laws that could create confusion and uncertainty over what protections individuals have. companies are also increasingly aware of the critical role they play in protecting privacy. looking ahead, the tech industry will continue to develop mechanisms to hold us accountable, including recommendations that any privacy law mandate companies identify, monitor, and document uses of known personal data, while ensuring the existence of meaningful enforcement mechanisms. nuala o’connor nuala o’connor is president and ceo of the center for democracy & technology, a global nonprofit committed to the advancement of digital human rights and civil liberties, including privacy, freedom of expression, and human agency. o’connor has served in a number of presidentially appointed positions, including as the first statutorily mandated chief privacy officer in u.s. federal government when she served at the u.s. department of homeland security. o’connor has held senior corporate leadership positions on privacy, data, and customer trust at amazon, general electric, and doubleclick. she has practiced at several global law firms including sidley austin and venable. she is an advocate for the use of data and internet-enabled technologies to improve equity and amplify marginalized voices. for too long, americans’ digital privacy has varied widely, depending on the technologies and services we use, the companies that provide those services, and our capacity to navigate confusing notices and settings. “americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away.” we are burdened with trying to make informed choices that align with our personal privacy preferences on hundreds of devices and thousands of apps, and reading and parsing as many different policies and settings. no individual has the time nor capacity to manage their privacy in this way, nor is it a good use of time in our increasingly busy lives. these notices and choices and checkboxes have become privacy theater, but not privacy reality. in 2019, the legal landscape for data privacy is changing, and so is the public perception of how companies handle data. as more information comes to light about the effects of companies’ data practices and myriad stewardship missteps, americans are surprised and shocked about what they’re learning. they’re increasingly paying attention, and questioning why they are still overburdened and unprotected. and with intensifying scrutiny by the media, as well as state and local lawmakers, companies are recognizing the need for a clear and nationally consistent set of rules. personal privacy is the cornerstone of the digital future people want. americans deserve comprehensive protections for personal information – protections that can’t be signed, or check-boxed, away. the center for democracy & technology wants to help craft those legal principles to solidify americans’ digital privacy rights for the first time. chris baker chris baker is senior vice president and general manager of emea at box. last year saw data privacy hit the headlines as businesses and consumers alike were forced to navigate the implementation of gdpr. but it’s far from over. “…customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed” 2019 will be the year that the rest of the world catches up to the legislative example set by europe, as similar data regulations come to the forefront. organizations must ensure they are compliant with regional data privacy regulations, and more gdpr-like policies will start to have an impact. this can present a headache when it comes to data management, especially if you’re operating internationally. however, customers will have trust in a business when they are given more control over how their data is used and processed, and customers can rest assured knowing that no matter where they are in the world, businesses must meet the highest bar possible when it comes to data security. starting with the u.s., 2019 will see larger corporations opt-in to gdpr to support global business practices. at the same time, local data regulators will lift large sections of the eu legislative framework and implement these rules in their own countries. 2018 was the year of gdpr in europe, and 2019 be the year of gdpr globally. christopher wolf christopher wolf is the founder and chair of the future of privacy forum think tank, and is senior counsel at hogan lovells focusing on internet law, privacy and data protection policy. with the eu gdpr in effect since last may (setting a standard other nations are emulating), “regardless of the outcome of the debate over a new federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede.” with the adoption of a highly-regulatory and broadly-applicable state privacy law in california last summer (and similar laws adopted or proposed in other states), and with intense focus on the data collection and sharing practices of large tech companies, the time may have come where congress will adopt a comprehensive federal privacy law. complicating the adoption of a federal law will be the issue of preemption of state laws and what to do with the highly-developed sectoral laws like hippa and gramm-leach-bliley. also to be determined is the expansion of ftc regulatory powers. regardless of the outcome of the debate over a new federal privacy law, the issue of the privacy and protection of personal data is unlikely to recede."
"taika waititi, the comedic filmmaker best known for directing “thor: ragnarok,” has signed on to co-write and direct the pilot of a “time bandits” series currently in development for apple. the series is being co-produced by anonymous content, paramount television and mrc. deadline broke the news of waititi’s involvement. the “time bandits” series was first announced last year. it’s based on the cult classic terry gilliam film of the same name, which follows a young boy who tags along with a group of dwarfs as they jump through space and time, hoping to get rich and encountering a long list of famous semi-historical figures (sean connery as agamemnon! john cleese as robin hood!) in the process this is one of a number of projects that waititi has coming out this year — he’s also an executive producer on the fx adaptation of “what we do in the shadows” (the vampire comedy he wrote, directed and starred in with jemaine clement), a director on “the mandalorian” (the live-action star wars series for disney+) and his next film “jojo rabbit” is due for release this fall. and while we’ve been reporting for more than a year on all the movies and shows apple has been commissioning, we may finally, finally get the first official details on the company’s streaming plans at an event on march 25. apple sends out invites for march 25 ‘special event’"
"apple analyst ming-chi kuo is quite reliable when it comes to apple’s road map. and he shared a ton of information over the weekend in a new report obtained by 9to5mac. in 2019, you can expect a bigger macbook pro, a new display and upgrades to iphones, ipads and airpods. let’s start with the mac. according to kuo, apple has been working on a macbook pro with an all-new design. it’s unclear if those future models will retain the same keyboard, as many users have been complaining about the reliability of the butterfly keyboard. but kuo learned there will be a bigger model, with a 16 to 16.5-inch display. let’s hope that apple is going to trim down the bezels around the display. techcrunch already reported that apple will release a new mac pro in 2019. but kuo believes the company is also going to release a high-end display to go with this mac pro. it could be a gigantic 31.6-inch display with a 6k resolution. when it comes to iphones, kuo believes that apple will release three models just like in 2018. they should retain the same screen sizes and lightning connector. some models may have three camera sensors on the back of the device. face id and wireless charging could both receive an upgrade with bilateral wireless charging. it means that you could charge a second device using your phone, which is a great idea when you know that updated airpods with a wireless charging case are also coming in 2019. on the ipad front, the entry-level 9.7-inch ipad could become a 10.2-inch ipad with slimmer bezels. ipad pro models will receive an update with faster processors. as previously reported, a new ipad mini is still on the road map, as well as an updated ipod touch. finally, it sounds like the apple watch might only receive a minor update with ecg coming to international markets as well as a return of the ceramic option for the next version of the apple watch."
"following my report from yesterday, apple has removed many of the apps i pointed out. when you try to find them on the app store, they are no longer available. app store review guidelines are very clear when it comes to app duplicates. according to rule 4.3, you can’t release the same app multiple times on the app store as it is considered as spamming. but that rule has been poorly enforced, and some companies have taken advantage of that. in my original report, i focused on one category in particular — voip apps that let you get a second phone number and send and receive calls and texts from that new number. developers release multiple versions of the same app so they can use different names, different keywords and different categories. this way, they can cover a wide range of keywords when you’re searching for an app in the app store. so let’s look at the developers i called out yesterday. it’s still unclear if some of these apps will reappear after some changes. textme, inc. textme up second phone number — removed free tone – calling & texting — removed text me – phone calls + text — removed (update: this one is back on the app store) binarypattern and flexible numbers llc texting/calling phone burner — still available smiley private texting sms — still available texting shield – phone number — removed burner phone numbers sms/calls — removed business line phone number — removed appverse inc. phoner 2nd phone number text — removed text burner – texting anonymous — removed second line – 2nd phone number — removed dingtone inc. dingtone – wifi calling & text — removed telos second phone number — removed this case illustrates once again that apple holds the keys to the app store kingdom. the company acts as a judge and can make or break some companies. some of those companies have released clones of their apps and benefited from that strategy for many years. the main issue here is that app store rules aren’t enforced consistently. plenty of clones in other categories the clone plague is far from over. many categories also use this app store optimization strategy. jpeg labs has released four different apps that let you print photos in walgreens or cvs stores around you. they all do the same thing but have different names and keywords. (they also tell you to leave a review right after opening the app.) photo prints: 1 hour photos print photos: 1 hour prints printmatic 1 hour photo print same day canvas photo prints when you can’t beat them, acquire them another good example is mailpix, inc. you can find multiple copies of the same app. the company is also slowly expanding its app store footprint by acquiring competitors and changing those apps into duplicated versions of the main app. mailpix acquired photobucket’s printing app to turn it into a clone."
"apple is reportedly gearing up for a new streaming tv service to rival netflix, amazon and google this year, but in the meantime, it is also expanding interoperability with more third parties like smart tv makers to make what it already has available easier to use in the living room. in the latest development, smart tv maker vizio today announced at the ces consumer electronics show that it’s adding support for airplay 2 and homekit to its smartcast interactive tv platform. the integration will mean that vizio tv owners can link their other apple devices up to their tvs to browse and watch content from itunes, as well as any photos, videos or music on those devices. then, through homekit, they can also control that content and the rest of the tv using apple’s voice assistant siri. vizio said that the feature will be rolled out first to beta users of the smartcast 3.0 platform in the u.s. and canada in q1 2019. in q2, it will be rolled out to all smartcast tv users via a free, over-the-air update to the 3.0 version of the platform. “at our core, vizio is committed to delivering value. smartcast 3.0 is one of the ways we’re doing just that. by adding support for apple airplay 2 and homekit, users can play content from their iphone, ipad and mac directly to smartcast tvs, and enable tv controls through the home app and siri,” said bill baxter, chief technology officer, vizio, in a statement. he added that this also will make vizio the first smart tv brand to offer the ability for consumers to use any major voice assistant — siri, amazon’s alexa or google assistant (the latter two integrations were added previously) — to control their sets. “we’re excited to be the first in the marketplace to support such a wide range of ways for consumers to sit back and enjoy the entertainment they love.” the google assistant functionality is also expanding to control more services such as the launching of apps and switching inputs. the vizio / apple news comes just one day after vizio’s bigger rival samsung — which has a 33 percent share of the smart tv market in the us compared to vizio’s 24 percent — also debuted an apple airplay integration, along with a new tab directly linking to itunes in samsung’s interactive platform. the itunes app is an exclusive to samsung for the time being, but the vizio deal lays the groundwork for more collaboration between vizio and apple ahead. vizio, notably, is not a direct competitor to apple in other business areas in the way that samsung is. for vizio, this is a significant step ahead for the company at a time when it is playing some catchup against samsung, which once trailed vizio but gradually overtook it as the leading smart tv player. i’d argue that vizio is also still recuperating from its no-good, very bad 2017. its series of unfortunate events included a failed $2 billion acquisition of the company by chinese maker leeco after leeco itself fell apart; a lawsuit against leeco over that deal breaking down; another lawsuit, this time from the ftc (settled for $2.2 million) over snooping on its customers’ viewing habits; and a third suit brought by amd, this time over graphics patent infringement, which amd has since won. this is actually the first time that vizio has been at ces in years, which is also saying something. the company is also using the event to announce its newest range of 4k hdr smart tvs and audio equipment, including sound bars and subwoofers. on the side of apple, taken together, the two integrations with vizio and samsung underscore apple’s challenges and ambitions at the moment. the company last week warned the market that sales of its iphone smartphone — for years now the company’s undisputed growth engine — would be falling short of expectations for a number of reasons. (they included worse-than-expected sales in china, where price and feature competition is fierce; a global slowdown in phone sales as the market saturates; and weaker demand for its new, expensive models. apple, as you know, has over the years been building up a services model to complement its hardware business — with apps, music, video, cloud services and more — and many believe that the company will start to focus on that even more to offset slowdowns in its hardware sales, as well as to boost the sales of that hardware. (hence the rumors of a netflix-style ott video service.) it’s an opportunity for sure, but not a guaranteed win. apple tv — the company’s existing bridge to content on televisions — hasn’t managed to overtake the collective popularity of other smaller middleware like google’s chromecast and amazon’s fire tv and fire stick. and the ott market is very crowded already, with offerings from all of the above, pay-tv providers, smart tv makers and more. given all of the above, it will be worth watching to see who else might have apple-related news this week and if a kinder, more device-agnostic apple-as-services provider emerges as a theme at ces this week."
"honor officially launched the honor view 20 today in paris. honor is huawei’s sub-brand for mid-range phones. and the view 20 doesn’t look like your average smartphone — the company traded the notch for a hole-punch display. honor thinks this design isn’t as intrusive as a centered notch. and rumor has it that samsung could also put a hole-punch display into the samsung galaxy s10. i played with the honor view 20 for a bit of time, and it definitely feels different from an iphone x-style notch. let’s start with the little details that annoy me. the 4.5mm cutout for the selfie camera isn’t exactly in the corner of the device and it looks a bit weird with a standard android menu. somehow, i want the cutout to be vertically centered — it’s not. and yet, when you look at photos and videos, it looks great. after a few minutes, you barely notice it. it feels like yet another icon in the notification area while the rest is just s-c-r-e-e-n. i hope more companies are going to follow this trend. the device features a gigantic 6.4-inch lcd display with rounded corners — i’ve been using oled displays for a couple of years, and it’s hard to look at lcd displays again. it’s nearly as big as an iphone xs max. while you can’t find a bezel at the top of the device, the view 20 still has a chin — a small bezel at the bottom of the device. unlike huawei’s p20 pro, the company has moved the fingerprint sensor to the back of the device. it has two cameras on the back — a 48 megapixel sony imx596 sensor as well as a second, cheap sensor to detect objects in 3d and add background blur using software features. huawei/honor has updated its system-on-a-chip. the company has been working on its own chips instead of working with qualcomm or samsung. the result is a new kirin 980 system-on-a-chip. like apple’s a12 bionic, the company now uses a 7nm manufacturing process. the phone has a 4,000 mah battery. it comes in four colors — midnight black, sapphire blue, phantom red and phantom blue. as you can see in the photos, the company is still setting its phones apart from the competition thanks to colorful backs with mesmerizing reflections. this time, the honor view 20 has a v-shaped pattern on the back. unfortunately, it attracts fingerprints like crazy. the honor view 20 is going to be available starting tomorrow for €569/£499 for 6gb of ram and 128gb of storage, or €649/£579 for 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage. as usual, huawei/honor focuses on asia and europe. but the best part about this new phone is that you get an exclusive character skin for fortnite when you buy it. what else do you need from a phone?"
"apple has always been an evolving company. while it never really invented any product categories, it always seemed to make those product categories work better and smarter. it also found a way to make us want them, even when they were more expensive. today, the wsj reports, apple is trying to find its way to a future without the iphone at the center of its revenue model. this shift happens as apple reported lower revenue for the first time in years against a backdrop of flagging iphone demand. part of the problem is a shifting chinese market, but it’s also due to people simply taking longer to refresh their phones. as that happens, and the price of iphones soared to more than $1,000, there has been a decline in sales. with iphone sales down 15 percent, this was not a typical apple earnings report, but it was something the company had anticipated when it announced lower q1 guidance at the beginning of the year. if the wall street journal story is accurate, apple is already trying to take steps to move the company into its next phase, possibly as a services business. apple lowers guidance on q1 results, cites china trade tensions if that’s the case, it would mark a radical departure from the company’s history in which it has redesigned various types of hardware, bucking popular design trends along the way. back in the 1970s and 1980s when it was called apple computer, steve jobs and steve wozniak made computers with a gui when most people were working from the dos prompt. in the early 2000s, apple came out with an mp3 player called the ipod and opened a music store called itunes. by 2006, the year before it would introduce the iphone, apple had sold more than 42 million units and 850 million songs. it was a combination of hardware and services that helped transform a flagging company into a powerhouse. in 2007, when apple introduced the iphone, it knew that it would begin to eat into ipod sales, and it eventually did, but it didn’t matter because it was the next logical step forward. when it introduced the app store in 2008, the iphone became more than a standalone piece of hardware. it was a new kind of hardware-service model and it would generate incredible wealth for the company. the ipad came along in 2009 and the apple watch five years later, in 2014. while each has done reasonably well, nothing has touched the success of the iphone. keep in mind that analysts estimated that apple sold 71 million iphones last quarter, and this was in a quarter in which sales declined. it’s hard to sell 71 million units of anything in a three-month period and have it be a down quarter. what comes next is probably some combination of entertainment/content and making use of advancing technologies like ar/vr, driverless cars and artificial intelligence. it’s unclear which direction apple will take in these areas, but we do know that recent hires and acquisitions point in these directions. sorry that i took so long to upgrade, apple there has long been speculation that apple could make a splashy acquisition in the content area. when eddie cue, apple senior vice president of internet software and services was interviewed by cnn’s dylan byers at south by southwest last year, buyers specifically asked cue about buying a property like netflix or disney. he implied that it was about taking the apple tv and combining that with a big-name content production company. cue indicated that the two companies were great partners for apple tv, but he wasn’t ready to commit to anything along those lines. “generally, in the history of apple, we haven’t made huge acquisitions.” he went on to explain, from apple’s perspective, it wants to figure out where the future is and to build something to get it there, rather than buying something that is working for the current state of affairs. it’s worth noting that apple tv has not matched the huge success of its other devices, but service revenue has been growing steadily. in the most recent earnings report, apple reported services revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19 percent year over year. that’s still a small percentage of the overall $84.3 billion the company reported for the quarter, but it is growing. regardless, nobody can know if apple can approach the success with any product that it has had with the iphone. but it knows that in spite of its vast riches, it’s dangerous for any company to rest on its past success. so it looks ahead and hires new blood and looks for a future with less dependence on the iphone because it knows, as the grateful dead once sang, “you can’t go back and you can’t stand still. if the thunder won’t get you, then the lightning will.” apple is hoping to avoid that fate, and perhaps it is some new combination of hardware, content and services that could lead the way."
"among true crime shows, “murder mountain” clearly has the best title. it’s memorable, mysterious and alliterative — it was a real struggle not to just say “murderrrrrrr mountainnnnnnn” throughout this whole episode of the original content podcast, where we review the show. “murder mountain” (the local nickname for the town of alderpoint) tells the story of marijuana growers in california’s humboldt county — and as the title suggests, it portrays a largely lawless and violent world, using one murder as its starting point, then following the story as it leads to one violent confrontation after another. at the same time, the show (produced by fusion and now streaming on netflix) offers plenty of historical context around the hippie beginnings of pot-growing in humboldt, and what marijuana legalization means for small growers. and it’s beautifully shot, with compelling reenactments of key moments. we also discuss anthony’s lukewarm review of “captain marvel” and a recent sneak peek at hbo’s upcoming theranos documentary “the inventor.” you can listen in the player below, subscribe using apple podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice. if you like the show, please let us know by leaving a review on apple. you also can send us feedback directly.

"apple’s secretive efforts to develop a self-driving car — its so-called “project titan” — have taken a hard turn in 2019 after it emerged that the iphone-maker has reassigned 200 employees previously involved in its development. that’s according to cnbc which, citing sources, reported that a portion of the 200 staff were moved to other projects inside apple, while others — and it isn’t clear how many — were let go altogether. the news was enough to prompt apple to respond with a confirmation that included a rare mention of its automotive ambitions. “we have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at apple. as the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of apple. we continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever,” a spokesperson said. techcrunch reached out to apple for additional comment but, at the time of writing, the company had not responded. cnbc reported that the layoffs had been expected and were seen as an imminent restructuring under project titan’s new leadership, long-time apple veteran bob mansfield and doug field, apple’s former vp of mac hardware engineering who rejoined from the company in october after a spell with tesla. still, not a lot is known about the project. there have been sneak peeks — including a look at the unorthodox tech stack for the vehicle roof, which included a suite of sensors and autonomous hardware — while the company was said to have doubled its fleet as of last january. ceo tim cook previously called apple’s car push “the mother of all ai projects,” indicating that, despite the mystery, it is certainly taking up a huge amount of focus for the company. this isn’t the first time apple has restructured the project. back in 2016, it was said to have abandoned the bold target of developing its own vehicle, instead opting to develop vehicle smarts. exactly what the strategy is now following field’s appointment and this restructuring is not clear. apple lowers guidance on q1 results, cites china trade tensions"
"news media company theskimm is delving further into podcasting, with the launch of its first daily news podcast called skimm this, set to launch on march 4. similar to how theskimm’s morning newsletter helps people keep up with the latest goings-on in the world, the new podcast also aims to help readers quickly understand the news of the day. however, skimm this will be different from other news podcasts currently on the market, the company says. for starters, it will be released in the evenings — monday through friday at 5 pm — in order to reach people hitting the gym after work, commuters on their way home, or those who like to listen to podcasts during dinner prep, among others. and, it will not be a round-up of the day’s headlines, like other news podcasts. instead, skimm this will focus on around four stories in total over the course of about 10 minutes. the top story will always be a national or international subject, and the podcast’s goal will be to provide more context and clarity around this story to help listeners understand why it’s important. in addition, the company positions itself as a nonpartisan news source that only delivers facts, not opinions. more than half its audience said that’s what they wanted from a podcast, along with making the news relatable and easier to understand, the company notes. plus, theskimm’s own data indicated that one-quarter (24 percent) of its female millennial users use podcasts to listen to news, and among those who do, 60 percent listen every day. this isn’t the first podcast to launch from theskimm. in february 2018, it launched skimm’d from the couch, a weekly podcast series where theskimm’s co-founders and co-ceos carly zakin and danielle weisberg interview female leaders — like arianna huffington, taraji p. henson, whitney wolfe, katrina lake, reshma saujani, martha stewart and hoda kotb — about their path to success. the company also previously invested in other media programming, including skimm’d with… and get off the couch for facebook, and digital series sip n’ skimm. but with skimm this, the company is making a play to become more of a part of users’ daily routines — one which begins in the morning with the daily email newsletter that now reaches 7 million+ readers, continues throughout the day through theskimm app calendar integration (which reminds you of important events) and now concludes in the evening with skimm this. theskimm says it’s working with podcast and media company cadence13 on skimm this, and will distribute it to apple podcasts, google play and google’s android app, stitcher, tunein, spotify, iheart and radio.com. there will also be a “flash briefing” version of skimm this available at launch, where it will join the existing daily skimm briefing available on alexa and google home. the podcasting expansion comes at time when theskimm’s growth for its newsletter business appears to have leveled off. last may, when the company reported its $12 million series c funding round with big names like shonda rhimes and tyra banks attached, it said its daily newsletter reached around 7 million subscribers. that’s roughly the same figure it’s reporting today. the power of those readers is notable, though. since announcing the launch of skimm this in today’s morning newsletter, the new podcast’s trailer shot to no. 1 on itunes’ charts, in the news & politics section (according to podbay.fm data.) below is the trailer for skimm this:"
"last year, amazon joined the exclusive $1 trillion club. this year, it’s continuing to exude its stock market dominance. jeff bezos’ e-commerce giant accumulated $797 billion in market value on monday, ending the day trading up 3.4 percent at $1,629.51 per share and overtaking microsoft to become the most valuable publicly-traded company in the u.s. microsoft, which shot past apple to nab the title on nov. 28, closed up .1 percent at $102.06 per share monday with a market capitalization of $783 billion. according to fortune, november was the first time in eight years that microsoft successfully outpaced apple in the stock market, following concerns surrounding apple’s growth. apple, for its part, may not see itself at the top of this particular list again any time soon. the company’s chief executive officer tim cook issued a letter last week revising guidance for the company’s first quarter fiscal results. revenue estimates fell from an initial projection of between $89 billion and $93 billion to $84 billion, sending the company’s stock spiraling downward. today, apple failed to crack the top three most valuable companies, with google parent company, alphabet, grabbing the third spot instead. alphabet had a roughly $756 billion market cap monday afternoon, while apple’s hovered around $700 billion. “while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater china,” cook wrote in the letter. “in fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in greater china across iphone, mac and ipad.” as the largest u.s. stocks duke it out for the top spot, we can expect to see amazon, microsoft, apple and alphabet continue to trade places in 2019. apple’s trillion dollar market cap was always a false idol"
"a former magic leap engineer believes the problem with most consumer-facing augmented headsets on the market is their bulky size. “you wouldn’t want to wear them for more than one hour,” xu chi, founder and chief executive officer of nreal told me as he put on a bright orange headgear that looked just like plastic ray-ban shades. called light and powered by qualcomm’s snapdragon processor, nreal’s first-generation mixed reality glasses officially launched at las vegas’ tech trade show ces this week. with a lightweight play, the two-year-old chinese startup managed to bring in some big-name investors. aside from debuting light, nreal also announced this week that it has raised $15 million in total funding to date. the proceeds include a series a from shunwei, the venture fund that xiaomi’s founder set up, baidu’s video streaming unit iqiyi, investment firm china growth capital and others. according to xu, r&d is his company’s biggest expense at this stage. magic leap and other ar startups have a rough 2019 ahead of them the financial injection bears strategic significance to xiaomi and iqiyi. the former is best known for its budget smartphones, but its bigger ambition lies in an apple home-like ecosystem that surely welcomes portable mr headsets. iqiyi, on the other hand, already has a channel dedicated to virtual reality, which is meant to immerse the end user in a completely digital environment. mr content may just be around the corner to provide an interactive experience of the real world. taking money from shunwei rather than straight from xiaomi is a thought-through choice. xiaomi has backed hundreds of manufacturers to gain control over supply chains. its portfolio companies, in turn, get access to xiaomi’s retail channels, but they make comprises on various fronts, such as product design and pricing. founder and ceo xu chi holding nreal light’s glasses and chipset. photo: nreal xu doesn’t want his freshly minted business to lose independence. “we don’t want to pick sides. we want to be able to work with oppo and a whole lot of other brands. we want to be compatible with a wide range of devices — smartphones, laptops, pcs, and so on,” said the founder. in early 2017, the chinese entrepreneur started nreal with his co-founder xiao bing, an optical engineer. the brand “nreal” conveys the partners’ vision to bring users to spaces that fall between the real and unreal. xu, who spent years working and studying in the u.s., decided to pursue his ideas back in his homeland for easier access to supply chains. “we are combining our technological know-how from overseas with great resources in china’s manufacturing industry,” the founder said of his firm’s edge. the 85-gram (about 3-ounce) nreal light isn’t as featherweight as regular glasses, but it’s a significant improvement from the biggies it’s going after — magic leap one and microsoft’s hololens. nreal was able to shrink its gadget size because it uses a display solution that requires fewer cameras and sensors than its peers, xu explained. furthermore, nreal is fixated on the consumer market from the outset, unlike its bigger rivals which, in xu’s words, are “building gadgets for the next five or even 10 years.” “they want to disrupt everything from cell phones, computers to televisions. they are not necessarily oriented towards consumers,” xu added. the smart glasses come in a variety of colors. photo: nreal when it comes to performance, light claims its display has a 52-degree field of view and a 1080p resolution, which my human eyes weren’t able to verify when i wore it to play an interactive shooting game. that said, i did experience minimum dizziness and latency on light, as the company promised. the only irritating part was i started to feel the weight of the specs on my nose bridge a few minutes into my session. xu assured me that what i tried on was a prototype and that an assortment of nose pads and lenses for different facial features will be available. the glasses also come in a variety of flashy coral colors. nreal light won’t be shipping until q2 this year and mass production won’t arrive until q3. xu hasn’t priced his brainchild, but said it will probably hover around $1,000. by comparison, hololens charges $3,000 and magic leap one costs $2,300. where does that price tag leave nreal in terms of profitability? it’s a matter of what kind of consumer hardware nreal wants to become. “do we want to be apple or xiaomi?” the founder asked himself rhetorically. he’s sure of one thing: as the mr industry matures in china, production costs will also come down. the company is already mulling its own factory so as to beef up supply chains and reduce costs, according to xu."
"angelpad just wrapped the 12th run of its three months long new york city startup accelerator. for the second time, the program didn’t culminate in a demo day; rather, the 19 participating startups were given pre-arranged one-on-one meetings with venture capital investors late last week. angelpad co-founders thomas korte and carine magescas did away with the demo day tradition last year after nearly a decade operating angelpad, which is responsible for mentoring startups including postmates, twitter-acquired mopub, pipedrive, periscope data, zum and dronedeploy. “demo days are great ways for accelerators to expose a large number of companies to a lot of investors, but we don’t think it is the most productive way,” korte told techcrunch last year. competing accelerator y combinator has purportedly considered their eliminating demo day as well, though sources close to yc deny this. the firm cut its investor day, a similar opportunity for investors to schedule meetings with individual startups, “after analyzing its effectiveness” last year. feedback to angelpad’s choice to forego demo day has been positive, korte tells techcrunch, with startup ceos breathing a sigh of relief they aren’t forced to pitch to a large crowd with no promise of investment. angelpad invests $120,000 in each of its companies. here’s a closer look at its latest batch: lotspot is a parking management

"fitbit has a new fitness tracker, but it’s one that you can’t buy in stores. the company quietly uncorked the inspire on friday, releasing its first product that is available only to corporate employees and health insurance members. the idea is to offer a fully subsidized wearable that helps the company dig deeper into the corporate and business worlds. the new devices are available as a wristband with the option of a clip. the basic tracker’s features are pretty standard and include activity and sleep tracking, calory burn and alerts from a connected phone. a higher specced model includes heart rate tracking, gps for fitness tracking and deeper analytics on sleep. no prices are displayed on the website, but eligible customers won’t need to pay. in an interview with cnbc, ceo james park said the company has 6.8 million users on wellness programs include fitbit devices via employers, health plans or hospital programs. in offering the inspire — which is fitbit’s cheapest device yet — the goal is to grow that number further still. indeed, park said fitbit is a named covered fitness benefit in 42 medicare advantage plans across 27 u.s. states while it is working with insurance firms like unitedhealth. it makes sense that fitbit is moving into that space because the consumer market is a tough one. wearables are no longer an early novelty and competition is fierce. apple dominates at the high end with the apple watch — which has doubled down on health features — while, at the cheaper end, companies like xiaomi and its partner huami offer basic trackers from as little as $30. fitbit went public in 2015. while its share price rallied to $6.48 on friday on this news, it is still down massively from its list price of $20 and first-day trading close of $29.68. today the company’s market cap stands at around $1.6 billion."
"polyai, a london startup founded by experts in the field of “conversational ai” — including ceo nikola mrkšić, who was previously the first engineer at apple-acquired vocaliq — has raised $12 million in series a funding to deploy its tech in customer support contact centres. the round was led by point72 ventures, with participation from sands capital ventures, amadeus capital partners, passion capital and entrepreneur first (ef). polyai’s founders are graduates of ef, although they didn’t meet during the company building program but already knew each other from their time at cambridge’s dialog systems group, part of the machine intelligence lab at the university of cambridge. “we started polyai in 2017, straight after submitting our phd theses,” mrkšić tells me. “at cambridge, we developed state-of-the-art conversational technology, and starting a company was the best way to get this tech used in the real world. we brought many of our cambridge colleagues with us and started building the commercial version of our conversational platform.” targeting contact centres — in a bid to help make these low-margin businesses more scalable — polyai’s ai tech doesn’t just attempt to understand customer queries but ensure they can be conducted in a truly conversational way, regardless of the medium, which could be over email, messaging or voice. where a lot of conversation ai or voice assistants fall down, says mrkšić, is that they aren’t able to really follow a conversation, often lacking the ability to understand meaning within the context of a conversation’s history or follow-up dialogue. “our proprietary technology allows the ai agents to support really complex use cases,” he says. “our agents are built around a framework for modelling context, which means they can hold long conversations and remember all pieces of information that users had previously shared. the backend models are data-driven, and they are domain and language agnostic. this allows them to seamlessly scale across different use cases and world languages. in practice, this means that we don’t have to hand-craft agent behaviour — ai agents can learn by observing human agents at work.” that’s a hard nut to crack, which is why mrkšić believes deep vertical integration with contact centres will produce the best outcomes. he doesn’t rule out either buying a small to medium-sized contact centre or forming a strategic partnership to expedite improvements in polyai’s offering and the company’s understanding of how contact centres operate. his thesis is that ai can help make contact centres more profitable, although, early on in the startup’s life, the case is not yet proven. related to this, mrkšić and his team aren’t proposing that “ai agents” replace human agents altogether but work alongside them, quite literally, with each playing to their respective strengths. polyai co-founder and cto shawn wen argues that machines can do many things that humans struggle with, including having “instant access” to all of the relevant information needed to support a customer. at peak times, this can mean ai agents handling calls autonomously if human agents aren’t available, while leaving human agents with the more complex edge cases or ones where they can bring the most value through human empathy and eq. “we plan to pursue very tight integration with contact centres — be that through m&a, investment or other profit-sharing arrangements,” adds mrkšić. “whichever model we end up pursuing, we want full alignment between polyai and contact centres. too many ai companies have died trying to find favourable software licensing agreements years before their technology was ready for wide-scale deployment. we believe vertical integration is the best way to fast-track the development of our ml platform, as well as for polyai to stay independent in the long-term.”"
"very rarely does an early technology garner such an air of inevitability like ar has in the past few years. 2018 was supposed to be a year where the foundational tech for augmented reality was built out a bit and the industry took a couple big leaps. things started off well-enough, but momentum really doesn’t seem be on the side of some of the industry’s heaviest hitters heading into 2019, suggesting that life for earlier-stage startups may not be much easier. there are plenty of reasons to be long-term bullish on ar, but the time horizons some have espoused seems to be bogus and pitch decks organized around a near-term spike in phone-based or glasses-based users are going to have a tougher time being taken seriously in 2019. the ghost with the most for all of the ar advances made this year, the company most emblematic of ar’s numerous challenges was clearly magic leap . the company spent the past few years trashing industry standards and lauding their own approaches with braggadocio, but ended up releasing a product that largely iterated on its competitors. with the release of their “developer kit” this year, a product that clearly seems to have stopped being a first-gen product only when the reality of the climate availed itself, the startup seems to be finding that optics and infra progress is going to come more slowly than foretold. i’ve talked to more than a few people who think magic leap hindered progress in the ar industry by siphoning investor attention and discouraging other hardware startups from joining the fray in the face of a billions-backed unknown. but in 2019, there are fewer available plays for the funding juggernaut. they spent years trying to distinguish themselves from the corporate mission of microsoft and their hololens headset; now it seems they’ve begun to see that the only hope of justifying their sitting valuation in the next few years is enlisting support from the big customers that msft is chasing, as opposed to single-handedly birthing a consumer market. magic leap recently lost a bid to microsoft for a $480 million military contract to outfit troops with ar headsets, and as microsoft prepares to release a second-generation hololens with the enterprise in full concentration, it seems like magic leap is going to reshuffle its deck. dead-on-arrival content plays magic leap’s struggles are well-documented, but what plagues the overall ar industry seems less discussed. the consumer appetite for phone-based ar content is obviously lacking. even apple’s reality distortion field isn’t enough to convince people that its arkit releases have led to anything other than some weird experimentation for ios users. few android oems are boasting about compatibility with google’s arcore platform anymore, suggesting that approachable hardware standards for device makers wasn’t all that was missing from the failed tango brand. the most apparent mobile ar opportunities are probably in user-generated content, but there seems to be a disconnect between platforms and users in terms of how complex these ar experiences can and should become. at this point, selfie masks still seem to be at the edge of users’ comfort levels, leaving a lot of solved tech problems stuck in limbo waiting for a problem that makes them worthwhile. niantic is probably one of the most revenue-heavy startups dabbling in phone ar, even if it is a bit of a false idol for the industry. nobody seems to think of niantic as a capital-a augmented reality startup, but it’s clear that the team behind pokémon go sees the technology as a not-fully-tapped reservoir of potential for future gaming experiences that feel more social and more immersive than any mobile rpg that’s sucking up the majority of your playtime today. the company’s new harry potter title still doesn’t have a release date, we haven’t seen any gameplay, but we do know that ar plays a part in the title in some capacity. we’ll see if they figure out things the rest of the industry hasn’t. platform tech opportunities part of this broader content pain is the fact that some known platform fundamentals are still getting tackled. in 2018, the startups in ar that were raising the most buzz were so-called “ar cloud” startups, teams that were largely focused on solving more fundamental back-end problems around localization and mapping. it turns out “simple” problems like getting a bunch of users in a single session or keeping track of objects you’ve moved around between sessions are actually incredibly complex. 6d.ai is building ar tech that crowdsources a 3d mesh of the world a big issue is that ar fundamentally relies on a level of spatial understanding that goes far beyond grasping geometry. for all the ground that has been traversed by computer vision researchers this year, issues like segmenting environments by objects and accurately identifying them are still in the earliest stages. when you think of ar tech as a subset of vision problems, you realize that products today are being approached in a kind of bizarre manner. google has been making worthwhile movements in proliferating their lens computer vision engine across new apps and devices. in a very roundabout way, the company seems to have come to the worthwhile perspective that mapping an environment spatially doesn’t really help that much if you can’t parse the contextual nuances of what the camera is actually looking at, as well. a lot of the ar startups in this space have raised some cash on the backs of the smartphone ar trend and the hundreds of millions of potential users, but it still seems pretty dubious whether this market has legs. fortunately, most of these solutions have wide applicability across future industries like robotics and autonomous vehicles, helping computers interface with the real world through visual and geographic cues, but their utility might not be as ripe as they’d hope. this is an area where magic leap could be poised to find some relatively near-term success. the startup’s top brass spent a hefty amount of time at their developer conference talking about the “magicverse,” basically their vision for bringing localized ar layers onto geographic spaces where users with magic leap glasses could observe the content. without having taken a peek at the tech they’re working with, their biggest advantage seems to rely on their partnership with at&t, which is poised to start working more seriously with 5g in 2019. the back end still remains a much more exciting market than hardware in 2019, but there may still be some interesting movement with devices this year. i don’t trust most of the predictive data that exists surrounding headset sales, so i’m not even going to reference it; suffice to say that ar headset sales aren’t going to explode anytime soon. north focals more conservative ar hardware one trend that i am curious to see shake out is the more simplistic version of ar where the glasses basically just offer users a heads-up display for notifications and lightweight apps. companies like north and vuzix have been talking a lot about their work here. apple’s rumored ar glasses have been talked about for ages at this point, with 2020/2021 seeming to be the rumor mill sweet spot for a release time frame. if that’s the case, i’d bet it falls more into this design ethos than a hololens type device. the hardware just isn’t small enough yet, but it is getting close, and there could be some interesting early ground that the industry could gain by moving in more heavily on traditional wearable use cases — though high component costs will be an early limiter as well. ar glasses startup north picks up intel’s vaunt patents this is probably a hardware space snap has their eyes on; spectacles jogged a lot of the current thinking on glasses-type wearables, but at this point, the company needs something that has wide appeal and can feed users back into its own app. the company isn’t in a position to hock something with razor-thin or non-existent margins, and it doesn’t gain that much from a product that sells a few thousand units in terms of building its platform. bottom line for the facebooks and apples of the world, immediate market conditions and user interest obviously hold a different weight. u.s. investment firms with good track records spent a lot of time this year rejiggering their expectations for their first waves of investments. for the more ambitious privately held ar startups of the world, there’s probably going to be an issue with raising capital this year, as a lot of the top hardware companies have been seeking more free-flowing late-stage cash from chinese firms, which have been growing harder to pin down as the trade climate worsens. this is going to be a problem for hardware companies especially. after $130m+ in funding, ar startup blippar collapses for the most part, the bs is going to continue to get easier to parse this year. platform plays are going to have to dial in their target audience a bit more than “everyone with an ar-enabled phone”; more realistic expectations are something the industry should benefit from. arkit and arcore are going to level-up and game engine-makers are going to get better solutions for ar content creators. back-end vision challenges are going to get solved and enable things like more seamless multi-player, but there are plenty of reasons why these tech problem solutions won’t lead to big changes in user behavior. users failing to take off in the second year of some of these big platforms probably won’t dissuade apple, but it definitely will dissuade some investors from continuing to bet big on the near-term future of mobile ar."
"apple this morning announced a new partnership designed to train more people to code using its own programming language, swift. the company says it’s now working with the oakland-based nonprofit organization dream corps on the initiative, which will see apple providing technology along with curriculum guidance, professional support and advocacy to individuals in middle and high schools, college and beyond. the nonprofit currently operates its own learn-to-code program called #yeswecode, which has graduated 100 people to date and placed around 60 percent in tech jobs. its long-term goal is to help 100,000 young people from underrepresented backgrounds to be able to train for jobs in tech. “i see dream corps as a peace corps for the american dream,” said ceo vien truong, in a statement. truong joined the organization in 2015, and is herself the youngest of 11 children born to an immigrant couple who migrated from vietnam in the 1970s, apple also noted. “it’s about making sure that we can help support people who lived or grew up in communities like mine. and this partnership with apple will help unlock the untapped genius and talent within those communities, which will allow a new generation to achieve their dreams,” she added. dream corps is now working with the mayor’s office and city of oakland to find a location for a dedicated space to support the program with apple and other workforce development initiatives. apple says it’s expected to launch its program later this year in the bay area. apple’s investment in programming training and development is part of its larger community education initiative. but partnerships like this aren’t the only way apple is pushing people to learn to code with swift. since the language’s introduction in 2014, apple has rolled out several programs and tools aimed at helping introduce more people to swift, including the 2016 launch of kids coding app swift playgrounds; expansions of its own “everyone can code” program across the u.s. and elsewhere in the world; the addition of free coding sessions at its retail stores; and it has offered educational tools, software and curriculum for teachers. for apple, all of this is about ensuring there’s a new generation of developers learning its tools and swift, in order to develop new apps for its platforms, ios, macos, watchos and tvos. at last year’s wwdc event, apple ceo tim cook said there were 20 million registered developers on ios who collectively made about $100 billion in revenues, while the app store saw some 500 million visitors per week. as more of apple’s business shifts to its growing services business instead of just iphone sales, it’s critical to ensure the developer pipeline remains open and accessible."
"tesla’s general counsel, a veteran trial lawyer, has been replaced with a company insider just two months after taking the post. dane butswinkas, who was named tesla general counsel in december, is leaving the company, tesla confirmed. jonathan chang, who was most recently vice president of legal at tesla, has taken over the general counsel position. butswinkas is returning to the washington, d.c. law firm williams & connolly, where he had worked for nearly 30 years. wednesday is his last day at the company. before butswinkas joined tesla, he was co-chair of the williams & connolly’s commercial litigation and financial services and banking groups. butswinkas had worked with musk and tesla as outside counsel for several months before taking the internal position at the automaker. butswinkas left tesla because it was a poor cultural fit and a desire to return home to his family and law practice, a source familiar with the situation told techcrunch. other sources familiar with the situation said (without elaborating) that chang taking over the top spot had been in the works for some time. butswinkas said in an emailed statement that he will continue to work with tesla in an outside counsel role. “i have observed and have tremendous confidence in jonathan’s leadership skills and in the tesla team. when i joined the company, i said it would be hard to identify a more timely or essential mission than tesla’s—that’s as true today as it was then,” butswinkas said. tesla’s general counsel directs the company’s legal and policy teams around the world and reports directly to musk. it’s a key position at the company that was once held by todd maron, who joined tesla in 2013 after working as musk’s divorce lawyer. maron, a confidante of musk’s, became general counsel at tesla in 2014. chang’s appointment comes as the company continues to ramp up its model 3 program, specifically by pushing into europe and china. chang has worked with tesla, as an employee and outside counsel, for more than a decade. he first began working with tesla in 2006 at latham & watkins. he joined tesla in 2011 following tesla’s ipo and purchase of the nummi factory in fremont . chang was named vice president of legal in 2017. during his tenure at tesla, chang has steered the company through numerous legal challenges, notably fighting state laws that prohibit automakers from selling cars directly to customers. he also oversaw the legal organization’s corporate securities, mergers and acquisitions, real estate, compliance and sales and distribution functions in the united states and across europe. the recent rapid turnover in the general counsel position highlights more than a year of high-profile executive departures, including dave morton, the company’s chief accounting officer, who resigned a month after taking the job, gaby toledano, who joined tesla in may 2017 after 10 years at video game publisher electronic arts, and doug field, who left the top vehicle engineering post to return to apple. most recently, cfo deepak ahuja announced he was leaving the company."
"it’s a tricky proposition for a product launch: last year’s model, but with fewer features. but sometimes the rules of consumer electronic update cycles were made to be broken — or at the very least, a little bent. last year’s versa was itself a paring down from the company’s first true smartwatch, the ionic. in that case, things worked out great. we were…less than enthusiastic about the device when it first hit, and by all accounts, it wasn’t the sort of runaway success fitbit was counting on to right the then tenuous ship. but versa arrived with fixes to some of the product’s biggest issues — name pricing and size. fitbit’s second take on the category was a much more immediate hit. the device has propelled the company to the number two smartwatch spot here in the u.s., behind you know who. it’s precisely the success story the company needed. the versa lite finds the company dropping the entry-level price point even further, down from $200 to $160. that’s less than half the price of an apple watch series 4 — an extremely tempting proposition for anyone who has been eyeing a cupertino timepiece but has ultimately been too put off by the price tag to pull the trigger. the new device looks nearly identical to the full version, save for its loss of a couple of buttons. and really, it’s the features that the product doesn’t have that are the most important to this story. so let’s break those down. altimeter: meaning the lite doesn’t know how many steps you’ve climbed. lap tracking: you can still swim with the lite, but it won’t tell you how far. fitbit coach: those coaching videos won’t work on the watch. fitbit pay: no nfc chip. music storage. if none of those are jumping out at you, congrats. you just saved $40, because you, my friend, are the target demographic. it feels nice to be wanted, even if it’s just by a company trying to sell you gadgets. i’ll be honest, none of those are jumping out at me as things i would truly miss (though your mileage will almost certainly vary). the last two jump out most among the lot. they’re probably the two most important features for those interested in leaving the smartphone at home. i’ve long been convinced this is a fairly small portion of the overall market — especially when you factor out a smartwatch with built-in lte. in a recent interview, ceo james park told me that the lite is the result of conversations with the company’s user base — weighing which features are the most important and worth sacrificing in the name of keeping the price down. even more than that, however, i think the device is a testament to fitbit zeroing in on the versa’s real appeal: being a low-cost alternative to apple and samsung wearables. in other words, the lite makes the most sense as a stepping stone positioned somewhere between fitbit’s highest-end tracker and the full-fledged version. it’s a product designed for people looking to get more out of their products than the company’s monochrome wearables are capable of delivering, and, more importantly, it’s a mere $10 more than the charge 3. it’s frankly a tough deal to resist. of course, all of the complaints about the original versa still stand (but for those that were tied to features that aren’t present). there’s no gps, the ui is almost too simple and the app selection is still lacking. on the last front, things will continue to improve, at least. the company has demonstrated that it’s a force to be reckoned with among the smartwatch set, so eventually there should be more marquee additions. for now, however, it still means slim pickings. the one place that’s less true is on the fitness/wellness front, simply because fitbit has spent years refining its own offerings. the product offers an insightful peek into movement, sleep and the like, with detailed breakdowns accessible via the app. like a weirdo, i’ve been wearing both the versa lite and apple watch series 4 on my wrist for a few days and found the step counts close enough to be within the margin of error. the versa does a good job determining the differences between running, walking and the treadmill — though i did miss the auto-tracking notification that pops up on the apple watch when it detects a workout. and unlike the series 4, there’s no ekg/ecg option here — though again, pricing is a part of that. as is, frankly, the speed with which the company had to launch a smartwatch team. the size and shape are great. a smaller version for smaller wrists would have been nice, but it’s compact enough to fit on a lot more body sizes than many of the clunky smartwatches currently crowding the market. it also looks nice, with a minimalist design that brings to mind nothing more than a squat, squircle apple watch with a more plasticky finish. as for the battery, that’s stated at four days. i haven’t been wearing the device that long, but i’m going on multiple days already without having to charge it up. so far, so good. the biggest disappointment with the lite is that it’s not the versa 2. it’s nice to see a company like fitbit reverse its fortunes, and the acquisitions that led to these new smartwatches are arguably the single-biggest driver. the ionic represented a bit of a swing and a miss, while the versa was a solid line drive. that makes the lite a bit of a bunt. it’s not bad. the players advance, but more than anything, it leaves you wondering what’s up next in the lineup."
"if nothing else, last week’s fitbit event showed the world that the company had learned two key lessons in the past year. one: price is possibly the largest driver in the company’s recent smartwatch success — so it went even lower with the $160 versa lite. two: there are just too damn many fitbit models. the release of the inspire represents a culling as much as it does something new. the line includes two devices (the inspire and the heart rate-monitoring inspire hr), which are effectively replacing five: the alta, alta hr, zip, one and flex 2. it’s a welcome thinning of the herd. there were enough different fitbit models to render the company’s product line confusing for experts, let alone casual consumers who have no interest in reading the fine print. the argument can be made that there are still too many fitbits on the market, but let’s just accept that it’s a step in the right direction. so, why a new name? when we spoke last week, ceo james park told me it was because the device was new enough to warrant some rebranding. i don’t entirely agree with the sentiment here, but perhaps it was, indeed, time for a fresh start. the device is more a distillation of lessons learned from the products it’s replacing. it’s an acknowledgment that simplicity is one of the biggest appeals of the company’s trackers — it’s certainly what separates them from their smartwatches. “trackers are a pretty mature category at this stage,” park told me, “so i think we’ve been able to figure out what the minimum number of skus is to hit all of the price points and demographics.” among other things, that means a device that can effectively double as a wrist-worn tracker or an old-school clip-on pedometer, depending on the accessory you choose. with a starting price of $70, it’s pretty reasonable for either option — and doubly so for those who like to switch things up. again, as with the versa lite, pricing is key here. after all, among the company’s other woes in recent years is the increasing presence of extremely cheap trackers coming from places like china. fitbit may never be able to compete on pricing with xiaomi’s $15 mi band, but, among other things, what the company brings to the table is years of focus on the space it’s help defined. that includes the result of generations of product design and app refining. like the versa lite, the inspire is less about bringing new features to the table than it is streamlining existing offerings. i gave the device to our video producer veanne, as my own wrists were occupied with the versa lite and apple watch 4 to a/b test the new product. even for me there’s a limit for the number of trackers i will wear on my wrist at any given time for testing. turns out that limit is two. she’s been using the inspire hr for several days now. when i asked her for feedback, she said, “i don’t have extensive notes, it’s a fitbit.” fair enough. that, in and of itself, is actually a pretty decent summary of what we’re dealing with here. there’s nothing groundbreaking — or really even exciting — here. but fitbit knows how to make good trackers, and this is one. the industrial design is, as ever, solid. the device doesn’t stray far its fellow fitbits, which is fine. at this point in the fitness tracker lifecycle, it appears most people want a device that can blend in as much as anything. the inspire accomplishes this with a nice line of swappable straps and a relatively small profile. though veanne is quick to note her “child size” wrists. “i’m the one the kids used to target during red rover.” consider that a hot tip, in the off-chance you ever find yourself competing against the techcrunch stuff in any school yard games. as such, she’s taken to wearing the device upside down, with the screen facing inward. it should be noted that among the devices that the inspire replaces devices that are, in fact, skinnier, which could ultimately prove an issue for those with smaller wrists.the ability to wear it as a clip on addresses that to some degree, but ultimately you won’t be getting the same sort of detailed feedback, including things like heart rate monitor (only available on the $100 inspire hr, mind) won’t be measured. it’s telling, i think, that the inspire began life as part of the company’s newfound healthcare focus. by distilling the product to its essence, the company has made the line inherently utilitarian. the era of excitement around fitness trackers as consumer electronics may have come to a close, as companies like fitbit see more financial windfall in teaming with corporations and healthcare provides. that’s not necessarily a bad thing — in fact, fitbit in banking on exactly that as for its future."
"the director and star of “lost in translation” are working together again, with bill murray starring alongside rashida jones in “on the rocks,” a new film directed by sofia coppola. the movie will tell the story of a young mother who reconnects with her playboy father in new york city. production is supposed to begin this spring. “on the rocks” is the first film to come out of the partnership between apple and a24, which will see a24 (the studio behind “moonlight,” “lady bird,” “hereditary” and other indie hits) producing several titles for apple . the deal will help apple’s yet-to-launch streaming service offer high-profile original films alongside shows like its star-studded morning news drama and an adaptation of isaac asimov’s “foundation” novels. it’s been nearly 16 years since the release of “lost in translation,” which was a financial and critical hit — it remains the highest-grossing film of coppola’s directing career, and it cemented murray’s shift to more serious roles. it also won coppola the academy award for best screenplay, and it nabbed murray his only oscar nomination thus far. (how is that possible??) since then, coppola has only directed murray once, in the idiosyncratic netflix special “a very murray christmas.” apple reportedly plans to give away its tv content, because that worked well with u2"
"youtube music is coming to the next critical battlefield for streaming music services: india. the company announced this week it’s launching its ad-supported version of youtube music for free in the country, as well as youtube music premium, its subscription that offers background listening, offline downloads and an ad-free experience for ₹99 a month. in addition, youtube premium, which extends offline play, background listening and the removal of ads across youtube, is also launching in india. this will include access to youtube original programming like cobra kai, bts: burn the stage and others, and ships with the music premium subscription for ₹129 (rupees) per month. this is not google’s first entry into the streaming music market in india. the company already operates google play music — and now, those subscribers will gain access to youtube music as part of their subscription, the company says. india is a key market for streaming services because of its sizable population of 1.3 billion people, many of whom are still coming online for the first time. (only some 483 million are active internet users today). already, apple and amazon operate their music services in the region in addition to local players like gaana, saavn and others. spotify also made an india launch a strategic focus this year. however, spotify’s entry into india has been complicated by a licensing dispute with warner music (wmg’s warner/chappell publishing arm, specifically). that conflict led to spotify arriving in the market without some of today’s biggest artists, like cardi b. and ed sheeran. the case has been ugly: warner sued spotify asking for an emergency injunction; spotify then accused warner of “abusive behavior;” and warner called spotify a “liar.” despite its legal troubles, spotify hit 1 million users in india within a week of launching. that bodes well for its potential when it gets through the legal battles. unlike spotify, youtube music is fully licensed as it enters the region — a potential competitive advantage for the time being. it also has a deal with samsung where galaxy s10 owners can gain four months of youtube premium/youtube music premium for free. (but spotify has a deeper samsung partnership, involving preinstalls and bixby integrations.) for youtube, a win in india is needed, as its streaming music service hasn’t picked up traction to date. to some extent, that’s because youtube users know they can get to music videos for free, but it also has to do with google’s baffling strategy in operating two separate brands around music. apple doesn’t make this mistake. it leverages the power of its platform to promote its only music service, apple music. that may have gotten it into trouble, though — today, spotify filed a complaint with the european commission over the “apple tax” levied on its rivals and its restrictive rules. google has said it plans to merge its two music services at some point, but for now the split likely leads to confusion. “india is where the multi-lingual music scene thrives,” said lyor cohen, global head of music, youtube, in a statement. “it’s interesting to note how indian artists have consistently claimed top spots over the last few months in the global youtube top artists chart. with youtube music, we are hoping to bring the best in global and indian music to millions of fans across india, and give them an immersive music experience, with the magic of music on youtube,” he added."
"as the rate of smartphone sales continues to slow down and decline, a software startup called kaios — which launched in 2017 from the ashes of mozilla’s failed firefox os mobile project as a provider of an internet-based feature phone os, feature phone apps, and corresponding html5 app store that all work over advanced mobile data networks — is betting that there is still a big, lucrative market for cheaper, lower-end feature phones, and it’s announcing a slew of news this week on the road to leading it. with 85 million phones now shipped in more than 100 markets with handset brands like nokia and india’s jio, kaios now has an expanded partnership to put more google services natively into kaios phones, specifically deeper integration with google assistant and google maps, and the debut of a youtube app — one of the most popular apps of all on smartphones — for kaios. for context, kaios (based in san diego but with the majority of its r&d in taiwan) raised $22 million from google last year and had already worked to put basic assistant and maps functionality on its phones. (we also understand kaios is on the cusp of another big round.) alongside this, kaios is launching several new handsets with feature phone handset makers; deals for kaios-powered phones with developing market carriers ooredoo and orange; and the launch of several new services: its first advertising sdk, kaiads; and life, a suite of services for first-time mobile service users to help them figure out how to use their phones and provide content and functionality around things like mobile banking and access to health, education and other services. ooredoo is active in north africa, the middle east and asia, and it will roll out phones first in its home market of qatar. while orange is the incumbent carrier in france, its efforts with kaios will be focused first on its footprint in africa. while the main mobile story in the last 10 years has been about the ineluctable rise of smartphones boosted by apple’s ios, google’s android, and a huge range of handset makers using the latter to push the boundaries ever more on what it means to have a portable computer in your pocket, kaios sebastien codeville says that this does not tell the whole story. in developing markets, it’s about offering something less expensive than smartphones but loading them with all the features that a smartphone affords, a crucial way of bridging the digital divide in places where a phone will be a person’s only way to access the internet. “yes, smartphones are quite affordable as the least expensive models are now priced at around $35, but kaios is $15-20. it’s still half the price of a smartphone,” he said in an interview. “there are 2g feature phones priced at $7-8 dollars, but they don’t have access to most mobile services. kaios is something in between.” it also helps that kaios is easy on battery life, with a handset typically able to last five days on one charge. in more mature markets, it’s about picking off specific categories of users who have not been well addressed by smartphone makers. “seniors are looking for phones with keyboards because of dexterity issues. the use of a touch panel is not easy for them,” he said. “and manual workers might be looking for more rugged products, and others may just want companion phones that can help them mostly disconnect on the weekend, or can be used for sports. smartphones are not good solutions for these, either.” this, in fact, is why a company like google, whose android operating system has helped to usher in the existence of the sub-$50 smartphone, is working with kaios. “we are a distribution platform to customers that they cannot access,” said codeville. while assistant and maps have been on kaios phones before now, the deeper integration will mean a couple of different things. first, kaios phone users in more local markets, specifically india, indonesia, mexico and brazil, will now be getting the services. and second, those who are using features like maps or assistant will now also be able to enter requests using their voice — a key component not just because you may be using these when you’re on the move, but because text entry into keyboard phones can be fiddly. “if you look at the emerging markets, we’ve seen that the number of assistant users has multiplied by seven,” google’s behshad behzadi said earlier today as part of a bigger announcement to expand google’s language and device support on mobile. “the main reason for this is that for the new users which are coming to this technology for the first time, voice is really the easiest and most natural way for them to use their phones. it’s removing a technology barrier for these users.” despite their close working and investment relationship, codeville also admits that android is also kaios’s biggest competitor, too, since it is the os that powers the devices that are most likely to rival feature phones in terms of price and functionality. android may be a rival, but it’s also a template of sorts for kaios. up to now, the feature phone startup has made small revenues from licensing, said codeville, but the business model for kaios is mostly focused around revenues from its app store, and soon from what it hopes will be a lot of advertising around content and apps that people use through the kaios browser, in the form of kaiads. available to developers in the form of an sdk, this is a supply-side platform that will tailor ads to work specifically on kaios and other feature phones, a segment that hasn’t really been addressed that well up to now because so many feature phones have smaller screens compared to smartphones, and have not really been designed to work with internet-based services. one of the key features of kaiads, the company says, is that it renders ads in 200 milliseconds or less. if advertising is kaios’s stick, then its suite of ‘how-to’ content and services, life, will be the carrot, so to speak. codeville would not go so far as to say that this is the company’s effort at corporate social responsibility — “we’re just a startup,” he protested — but he did confirm that the service does serve a dual purpose. it’s not just an effort to get people more acquainted with using the services, but in doing so, it will help grease the wheels of kaios’s business model. “if we want to be sustainable and have a long term life of our own, we have to develop the monetization,” he said. life, he added, will be very localised and will roll out country by country, likely starting with regions in africa."
"in case you hadn’t seen, amazon is buying router maker eero. and in case you hadn’t heard, people are pretty angry. deluged in a swarm of angry tweets and social media posts, many have taken to reading tea leaves to try to understand what the acquisition means for ordinary privacy-minded folks like you and me. not many had much love for amazon on the privacy front. a lot of people like eero because it wasn’t attached to one of the big tech giants. now it’s to be part of amazon, some are anticipating the worst for their privacy. of the many concerns we’ve seen, the acquisition boils down to a key concern: “amazon shouldn’t have access to all internet traffic.” rightfully so! it’s bad enough that amazon wants to put a listening speaker in every corner of our home. how worried should you be that amazon flips the switch on eero and it’s no longer the privacy-minded router it once was? this calls for a lesson in privacy pragmatism and one of cautious optimism. don’t panic — yet nothing will change overnight. the acquisition will take time, and any possible changes will take longer. eero has an easy-to-understand privacy policy, and the company tweeted that the company will “continue to protect” customer privacy, noting that eero “does not track customers’ internet activity and this policy will not change with the acquisition.” hi steve! eero and amazon take customer privacy very seriously and we will continue to protect it. eero does not track customers’ internet activity and this policy will not change with the acquisition. — eero support 👋 (@eerosupport) february 11, 2019 that’s true! eero doesn’t monitor your internet activity. we scoured the privacy policy, and the most the router collects is some basic information from each device connecting to the router that it already broadcasts, such as device name and its unique networking address. we didn’t see anything beyond boilerplate language for a smart router. and there’s nothing in there that says even vaguely that eero can or will spy on your internet traffic. among the many reasons, it (mostly) couldn’t even if it wanted to. every single time you open an app or load a website, most now load over https. and most do because google has taken to security-shaming sites that don’t. that’s an encrypted connection between your computer and the app or website. not even your router can see your internet traffic. it’s only rare cases like facebook’s creepy “research” app that forces you to give it “root” access to your device’s network traffic when companies can snoop on everything you do. if eero starts asking you to install root certificates on your devices, then we have a problem. fear the internet itself the reality is that your internet service provider knows more about your internet activity than your router does. your internet provider not only processes your internet requests, it routes and directs them. even when the traffic is https-encrypted, your internet provider for the most part knows which domains you visit, and when, and with that it can sometimes figure out why. with that information, your internet provider can piece together a timeline of your online life. it’s the reason why https and using privacy-focused dns services are so important. it doesn’t stop there. once your internet traffic goes past your router, you’re into the big wide world of the world wide web. your router is the least of your troubles: it’s a jungle of data collection out there. props to the spirited gentleman who tweeted that he trusts google “way more with my privacy than amazon” for the sole reason that, “amazon wants to use the data to sell me more stuff vs. google just wants to serve targeted ads.” think of that: amazon wants to sell you products from its own store, but somehow that’s worse than google selling its profiles of who it thinks you are to advertisers to try to sell you things? every time you go online, what’s your first hit? google. every time you open a new browser window, it’s google. every time you want to type something in to the omnibar at the top of your browser, it’s google. google knows more about your browsing history than your router does because most people use google as their one-stop directory for all they need on the internet. your internet provider may not be able to see past the https domain that you’re visiting, but google, for one, tracks which search queries you type, which websites you go to, and even tracks you from site-to-site with its pervasive ad network. at least when you buy a birthday present or a sex toy (or both?) from amazon, that knowledge stays in-house. knock knock, it’s amazon already if amazon wanted to track you, it already could. everyone seems to forgets amazon’s massive cloud business. most of the internet these days runs on amazon web services, the company’s dedicated cloud unit that made up all of the company’s operating income in 2017. it’s a cash cow and an infrastructure giant, and its retail prowess is just part of the company’s business. think you can escape amazon? just look at what happened when gizmodo’s kashmir hill tried to cut out amazon from her life. she found it “impossible.” why? everything seems to rely on amazon these days — from spotify and netflix’s back-end, popular consumer and government websites use it, and many other major apps and services rely on amazon’s cloud. she ended up blocking 23 million ip addresses controlled by amazon, and still struggled.. in a single week, hill found 95,260 total attempts by her devices to communicate with amazon, compared to less than half that for google at 40,527 requests, and a paltry 36 attempts for apple. amazon already knows which sites you go to — because it runs most of them. so where does that leave me? your router is a lump of plastic. and it should stay that way. we can all agree on that. it’s a natural fear that when “big tech” wades in, it’s going to ruin everything. especially with amazon. the company’s track record on transparency is lackluster at best, and downright evasive at its worst. but just because amazon is coming in doesn’t mean it’ll necessarily become a surveillance machine. even google’s own mesh router system, eero’s direct competitor, promises to “not track the websites you visit or collect the content of any traffic on your network.” amazon can’t turn the eero into a surveillance hub overnight, but it doesn’t mean it won’t try. all you can do is keep a close eye on the company’s privacy policy. we’ll do it for you. and in the event of a sudden change, we’ll let you know. just make sure you have an escape plan. smart home tech makers don’t want to say if the feds come for your data"
"few outside of the food service industry know about olo, a 13.5-year-old, new york-based mobile and online ordering platform for 250 restaurant chains, from applebee’s to cheesecake factory, from chipotle to denny’s and from jamba juice to chili’s. tiger global has been tracking the company’s growth, however. in fact, in a new secondary transaction, tiger just snapped up $18 million worth of employees’ equity. olo isn’t talking about at what valuation, but founder and ceo noah glass notes that the company’s previous investors — rre ventures, core capital and the raine group, among them — have collectively provided olo with $63.3 million in primary funding. and they didn’t sell a share to tiger. seemingly, olo’s traction has given them reason to hang tight to their holdings in the company. according to glass, more than 100 million orders were processed on olo’s platform last year — the same amount that had been processed by the platform across the first 12.5 years of the company’s existence. olo has also outlived or outgrown many of its earlier competitors, like onosys, a company that was acquired by living social and later acquired again by another competitor called splick.it, a smaller, boulder, colo.-based outfit. not last, olo, which sells it customizable tech stack as a subscription offering to its customers, is benefiting from numerous trends, including that people are increasingly eating restaurant food outside the establishments’ walls. according to the research firm npd group, close to half of dinners purchased from a restaurant are now consumed at home, partly because it can be cheaper and faster to eat at home, partly because there’s more entertainment at home (think netflix) and partly because of the rise of on-demand delivery services like uber and postmates. indeed, olo’s technology is largely responsible for enabling customers like shake shack to integrate third-party delivery services into their own point-of-sale systems, so that when an order comes through from, say, doordash, shake shack’s customized olo software can not only process the sale but help find a just-in-time delivery person to pick it up and take it to the customer. we talked with glass at length yesterday to learn more. for a much deeper dive into how the whole thing works (we find it kind of fascinating ourselves), keep reading. our conversation has been lightly edited for length. tc: you started this company back in 2005, two years before the iphone was announced. how? why? ng: i’d been working for endeavor global, which is sort of like a venture firm with a high-impact, nonprofit model, and i got to see and work with a lot of smartphone developers who were working on software before we called them apps. i thought then that we’d all have smartphones, and that when we did, it would make e-commerce possible in on-demand ways. that insight is what led to the first prototype, which i showed to [venture capitalist] david frankel, now of founder collective. he said, “if you believe in this enough to go for it and quit your job and withdraw your admission to harvard business school,” where i was headed, “i’ll give you half a million dollars to get started.” when i launched in nyc, i think under 5 percent of the population had a smartphone or mobile web on a mobile device, so we brought the service to life through text-message ordering first, then it evolved to include the mobile web, then apps. tc: and now tiger is in the olo business. why stage a secondary? ng: we’re in a very good place from a balance sheet perspective, but we now have 175 employees, with around half in engineering and then a big customer success team. and some of them have been with the company for 10-plus years. they’re true believers, and we wanted to reward them for that long-term loyalty. tc: olo sells software as a service to restaurant chains that don’t want to build their own enterprise software to take online orders. but you’re also involved in delivery. can you explain how? ng: first, about three years ago, we launched a service called dispatch that enables our brands to take orders, then get the order delivered without having to do delivery themselves. we partnered with various delivery service providers to create a network, basically, and we’ll find the nearest or cheapest courier to deliver to the customer just in time. we can do that because we know how long it takes for a meal to be prepared based on our deep integrations with our customers, so food is getting picked up at its peak quality, and then it takes 12 to 13 minutes on average for it to be delivered to someone’s front door. tc: and you charge that delivery provider a fee per transaction, sort of like a finder’s fee. ng: yes. we also have a service called rails that enables third parties like doordash and postmates and amazon restaurants to send orders through our api to keep things simpler operationally at the restaurants we serve. every order comes in through the same point-of-sale system. tc: so you aren’t competing with a doordash in any way but rather partnering with it. ng: right. we view doordash as another source of demand, and that’s a good thing for our restaurants. it drives more orders. we have to play the role of switzerland. if restaurants want to work with amazon or with caviar, that’s fine. we’ll work with anyone. we’re a common carrier. we could never say, “we’re only going to work with these two” third parties. tc: how much are you charging your customers, and how long are your agreements with them? ng: a typical agreement is 36 to 60 months on average, and it’s transactional saas, so we charge a fee per month per store — think of it as around $100 per month — then a small fee per transaction for our core ordering platform. tc: you must have tons of data. what percentage of diners are picking up food versus having it delivered? ng: more than 90 percent are customers picking it up. delivery accounts for just 3 percent at this point, according to npd data. it has huge growth ahead of it if you think about it. what’s more convenient than going to a restaurant and picking food up than having it magically come you? tc: but it comes to you at an added cost. if we enter into a longer recession, how does the picture change? how are your customers impacted?  ng: first, officially we work with restaurants that have 10 units or more, though we make exceptions to that rule every now and then and the goal is to be able to work with small chains and independent restaurants some day. and for the restaurants we work with, a recession could be an accelerant. we saw this in 2008, with more customers choosing to use digital ordering and save time instead of preparing food at home or heading to restaurants for a dining experience. fine dining will take a hit in a recession, but [our customers] are selling everyday lunch and dinner choices, and when you have families where both parents are working and you can get a meal curbside for often less than it costs to cook, that’s compelling. tc: do you sell the data you’re collecting from your transaction volume or might you someday? ng: we make zero revenue from our data today and if we did anything, it would only be with aggregated, anonymized data. but we haven’t done anything with it [to date], including because it’s a precious commodity and also because we’e very restricted in our contracts with what we can do. we do give our customers all the same data as if they built their own software. tc: but you can see things that no one else can see. any trends you can share? ng: we can see that the first monday after new year’s is the biggest day for every organic salad chain, whereas at the end of the year, people are eating burgers and pizza and chicken wings and burritos. you see the same thing play out each week. people start the week eating healthy food. by the end of the week, it’s barbecue-ville. tc: before you go, is olo profitable? ng: we’re not in a place of worrying about raising more money. we have no need for primary capital where we are. we’e big believers in this company as an independent company, and we’re building it until we’re ready to have some kind of [exit] event. we think that’s in the cards if we keep doing what we’re doing."
"apple recently invited reporters to meet a handful of companies announcing new products at this year’s consumer electronics show. the common theme: all of these products connect to apple’s homekit platform for smart home devices. by integrating with homekit, these companies make their products configurable and controllable via apple devices, specifically through the home app and siri. last year, apple rolled out a new software authentication system, which meant that manufacturers no longer needed to include an mfi chipset to be part of the program. this isn’t a comprehensive list of all the homekit-integrated products that will be announced at ces, but it provides a snapshot of what’s coming to the ecosystem in 2019 — smart light switches, door cameras, electrical outlets and more. here they are: new wemo light switches (pictured above) from belkin that start at $39.99. they allow you to control your lights with siri or the home app, and are planned for release in spring or summer of this year. a smart light strip and a smart power strip from eve, a company focused on homekit-integrated accessories. a new smart outlet from connectsense, allowing customers to monitor the power consumption of each outlet. unlike the company’s existing smart outlet² (which fits over existing outlets), the in-wall smartoutlet is — as the name implies — actually installed in your wall. it’s scheduled for release in the first half of 2019. kwikset is expanding its premis lineup of touchscreen smart locks with a new model that it describes as offering a more contemporary and sleek look. mighton plans to launch its avia smart lock in may. beyond their more high-tech functions, avia products are also supposed to be particularly secure locks, and are by the uk police’s secured by design initiative. the nanoleaf canvas is a modular smart lighting system that can create fun, beautiful patterns and even respond to music. a nanoleaf starter kit costs $248. netatmo is announcing a smart video doorbell allowing customers to see, on their phone, who’s ringing the doorbell. it’s also announcing a smart indoor air quality monitor that measures air quality, humidity level, temperature and noise."
"signs that the federal reserve could hold off on further interest rate hikes coupled with a booming jobs report sent stocks on wall street surging to close a volatile first trading week for the new year. after yesterday’s apple-induced slide, and in the face of economic indicators that signaled a potential slowdown in global and domestic growth, the chairman of the federal reserve, jerome powell, said that the central bank would be “patient” when it comes to raising interest rates. that news, coupled with a strong jobs report, sent stocks rocketing up. the dow jones industrial average climbed 746.9 points, or roughly 3.3 percent, while the nasdaq shot up 4.3 percent, or 275.4 points. it wasn’t just the fed chairman’s observations about the potential for rate hikes in 2019 that had investors buying, but assurances about powell’s job security in the face of increasing pressure from president trump. speaking at a panel discussion of the american economic association alongside former federal reserve chairs janet l. yellen and ben bernanke, powell said that he would not resign if asked by the president. immediately after powell’s comments stocks began surging. “with the muted inflation readings that we’ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” powell was quoted as saying in the washington post. “we’re always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary.”"
"rakuten tv, the japanese e-commerce giant’s effort to take on netflix and amazon in the world of video streaming, has been a minor player when it comes to market share for online entertainment, with a mere 7 million users of its service. but today, it’s unveiling two key pieces of news that it hopes will help reverse that. the company is adding 30 new countries in europe where the service will operate, bringing the total across the region and japan to 42. and it has inked a deal with big names in connected tv entertainment systems — specifically samsung, lg, philips and hisense — to embed a dedicated “rakuten tv” button on their remotes. the two moves together underscore how rakuten may not have been among those riding the wave as video streaming has exploded in popularity — compare its 7 million users with the 139 million users netflix reported in its most recent earnings — but it does not seem ready to throw in the towel on it, either. “we are here to continue running the marathon,” jacinto roca, the ceo of rakuten tv, said in an interview this week. “this is another step for us to become a global player in this industry.” it’s about time that netflix and amazon had some competition in the over-the-top video market — that is, video entertainment delivered to consumers over their existing broadband connections to compete with costly cable or satellite packages — but if they are perhaps some of the most obvious competition, they’re not the only ones. apple, google, a number of content owners themselves and device makers all believe they have a shot at muscling in and becoming the go-to destination for consumers’ video entertainment needs. rakuten tv in some ways looks directly like the japanese e-commerce company’s answer to amazon’s video service: both have moved into the area as a natural extension of their e-commerce businesses, which sell consumer electronics and already have extensive operations around content — namely books and e-books, and both would have already built a lot of the infrastructure needed to run these services as a by-product of those e-commerce operations. and, alongside other rakuten-owned assets like viber and ebates, this is one more move by the company to diversify not just its revenues and services, but the ecosystem in which customers are interacting with its brand. but rakuten tv has taken a different approach in at least three important ways. the first of these is in how it prices the service. there are no monthly subscriptions, and people watch and pay for movies on an à la carte basis. roca said that this is unlikely to change anytime in the future.  “we think that the simplicity of our offer is one of the key value propositions for us, so we have no plans to introduce monthly bundles,” he said. he added that in the case of rakuten tv, the company has found that customers watch more than one movie per month, and when you look at the average prices of its films — promotions might come in (in the u.k.) at 99 pence for one film, but a top release like the crimes of grindlewald costs £13.99 to view — “that is definitely a healthy arpu for us,” he said. “the focus today is making sure that we have people enjoying at least one movie per month on our platform.” he notes that the economics are ironically trickier in bundles for popular providers where multiple views are happening under one price, which can impact the margins on the overall service. (something that has been argued with music streaming, too.) the second area where rakuten tv is trying to stand apart from others in the streaming video space is its decision not to create original content, or at least not on any scale. the company last year put out a film that it produced, hurricane, which roca described to me as an “experiment.” “we will do three or four more films this year, to start learning about production, but we have no big strategy behind this right now,” he said, noting that content providers have some regulatory requirements in europe to also contribute investment to grow the content-production industry locally in the face of over-domination from the u.s. “it’s more an experiment, with but no strategic initiative.” content efforts can run into the hundreds of millions or even billions in terms of investment, as they collectively have for rakuten tv’s competitors, and while there is clearly some glory and cred that comes with that, for a smaller player it may not be a tenable option, given the challenges of distribution. it also puts rakuten into a better bargaining position with other content rightsholders, who will not eye it as a rival for eyeballs who might also use their own might as a bargaining chip when agreeing on licensing. that brings us to the third area where rakuten is trying to be a bit different, and one excuse of roca’s for why the company has taken so long to expand to more countries: localization. he says that rakuten tv will stand out from the field by offering a wider and better selection of content for each local market, using data to see not just what locals like to watch on tv, but what were popular cinematic releases that rakuten should definitely try to get for those markets. this takes time, he said. i have to admit there is something to this: if you have ever traveled to various far-flung places and attempted to watch netflix or amazon prime video, you might notice that not only do you get a much more limited choice of titles, but they are nearly the same from country to country and put a heavy emphasis on the services’ original content — likely one other reason why they have created it in the first place, to populate their services without having to do lots of tricky licensing deals. in any case, rakuten is putting investment in another, more basic area first before it can start to double down more on original content. the company is not disclosing how much it had to pay the smart tv makers to create a button on their remotes, but said that it made the investment based on strong results on existing handsets from roku and hisense. “we’ve had buttons on those for a couple of years, and we can see that we are bringing in new users from those buttons,” roca said. “so after two years with those, we decided it was the right moment to invest and go into brands that have big market shares in europe.” he says this will give rakuten tv potentially access to buttons on tvs from providers that collectively have a 75 percent market share in the region. of course, getting people handsets with those rakuten buttons is predicated on consumers actually buying new tvs, so this is a bet that very much has yet to pay off. the investment in smart tv placement is notable also because at the same time, rakuten is not expanding its presence in any notable way on mobile. that also is down to data, roca said: today, some 60 percent of its content is consumed on smart tvs. the company also touts that it has the largest catalog of 4k hdr movies in europe and is about to start trialing 8k. looking forward, roca said that rakuten tv’s plan is to enter completely different markets now that it has largely covered europe. that will include, most likely, latin america, which has a cultural and linguistic synergy with spain, the home market of rakuten tv (the japanese giant spearheaded its tv strategy around its 2012 acquisition of wuaki.tv, founded by roca, which it eventually rebranded). and it is also looking at which markets it might target in asia. another rakuten acquisition, of viki, which provides crowdsourced subtitles for online videos, could play a key part of its strategy in asia, where viki has a large usage base."
"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. what a week. it had looked a bit quiet with just a few big rounds to cover. i was looking forward to a relaxed episode, frankly. but no, as kate and i were prepping the show notes, the news gods opened the heavens and dropped a fifty-weight of mana right on our heads. it was a lot of news. in quick order, here’s what we tried to run through while keeping it brief: pinterest has filed to go public, albeit privately. at long last, pinterest’s ipo is underway. the social company is gunning for liquidity this year, could go public in june and is not targeting a down ipo. it’s looking like $12 billion and up for big pint. lyft’s ipo is racing along. lyft filed to go public back in december, dropping private filings neck-and-neck with uber. the two ride-hailing companies are both slated to get out this year, but it seems that lyft is going to lead the way. even more, it’s tipped to get out at a $20 billion to $25 billion valuation. as grounding, here’s the best math i could come up with concerning those numbers. doordash gets $400 million more. the rumored doordash round has landed, though it’s shaped a bit differently than we expected. doordash did not raise $500 million at a $6 billion valuation, it instead picked up $100 million less, but at a stronger $7.1 billion valuation. and, of course, the vision fund was involved. more vision fund largesse lands on clutter and flexport. what’s a week with just one vision fund round? a waste, of course. so, here are two more. clutter picked up $200 million while flexport raised a much more impressive $1 billion. clutter has now raised around $300 million while flexport’s capital sheet is flush now to the tune of $1.3 billion. as we touched on during the show, the two companies are now going to have more money to use than they have ever had before; let’s hope that that goes well. speaking of which, what about those valuations? two quick things to wrap up here. first, discontent among vision fund investors. the vision fund’s lps (the sources of its capital) aren’t perfectly happy with some of its choices. that, and what happened to people not taking blood money? we asked that again, probably shouting into the wind while we do so. as it turns out, silicon valley capitalism isn’t a new man; it’s just the same old capitalism in a sweater vest. all that and it was good to be back. chat you all in a week’s time! equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."
"one of china’s top live-streaming companies, yy, bought a stake and obtained the right to purchase a majority share in bigo last june, and now the other shoe has dropped after yy fully acquired the singapore-based startup behind live-streaming app bigo live and short-video service like. that’s according to an announcement yy made on monday, which disclosed it has bought out the remaining 68.3 percent of all the issued and outstanding shares of bigo for a price tag of about $1.45 billion. bigo’s connection to yy is deep-rooted. li xueling, a veteran chinese journalist who’s also known as david li, founded yy in 2005 well before the heyday of mobile-based live-streaming apps. with the intent to bring the china-tested business to overseas markets, li started bigo in 2016 to replicate yy’s lucrative revenue model where the platform operator takes a cut whenever viewers reward streamers with virtual gifts, which can be cashed out. yy racked up $675 million in net revenues and a net income of around $100 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, its latest earnings report shows. the bigo buyout is set to be a huge boost to yy’s international ambitions as its home market has been divided up between yy itself, its spin-off huya that focuses on esports streaming and huya’s archrival douyu. curiously, both douyu and huya are backed by tencent, the company best known for the wechat messenger, but is also china’s largest games publisher. to bring the domestic rivalry into perspective, nasdaq-listed yy recorded a monthly mobile user base of 90.4 million in the fourth quarter. huya, which priced its u.s. initial public offering at $180 million last august, posted 50.7 million monthly users from the same period. douyu hasn’t recently unveiled its size as the company is reportedly mulling to go public in the u.s., but third-party data analytics company questmobile put its mau in december at 43 million. “we are very excited to announce the completion of the acquisition of bigo. it is an important milestone for yy group which demonstrated our confidence and commitment to the globalization strategy,” said li of yy in a statement. huya and douyu have also ventured beyond china for new growth with their respective overseas brands nimo tv and nonolive. in its q4 earnings report, huya singled out foreign markets as one area of focus in 2019 and its nimo already enjoys having a powerful ally, tencent, which signed an agreement last july to help it with gaming content and brand recognition. huya’s overseas brand nimo tv “in addition to our vigorous domestic growth, we have successfully leveraged our unique business model to enter new overseas markets,” said chief executive dong rongjie. “we believe we are delivering long-term value through strategic investments in overseas markets in 2019 and beyond.” while anchoring in southeast asia, bigo has debuted in more than 100 countries worldwide and been in the top 10 of apple’s app store not just in neighboring countries like vietnam and cambodia but also in paraguay, yemen and angola, according to data collected by app tracking service app annie. growth in india has been particularly strong this year as the country captured 32 percent of bigo’s 11 million new android users who downloaded the app via google play between january and february, according to data provided by sensortower. li estimated in 2017 that bigo was generating an annual revenue of $300 million at the time. bigo claims 200 million registered users to date with maus reaching almost 37 million worldwide. its popularity has, however, gone hand in hand with its reputation for hosting offensive content, but the startup has assured it deploys resources to closely screen content. back in china, yy, huya, douyu and the likes are constantly grappling with the government’s tightening grip over online information, which puts the burden on media companies to keep a robust content monitoring team to not only rid illegal videos but also parse the country’s opaque definition of what’s considered “inappropriate.” update (march 5, 2019, 13:00pm): added details on bigo’s growth and huya’s overseas expansion"
"it’s not surprising that apple has a massive active install base of iphones across the globe, but we now finally have an exact number to put behind it. during its q1 earnings call, cfo luca maestri shared the install base for the first time. “our global active install base of iphone continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of december,” maestri said. “we are disclosing that number now for the first time; it has surpassed 900 million devices.” apple has previously detailed the total active install base of its products. they updated the number today to 1.4 billion devices worldwide at the end of december 2018, up from 1.3 billion at the end of january 2018. it’s interesting that apple has decided to break out iphone device numbers even as it shies away from releasing unit sales in its earning calls from this point moving forward. maestri detailed that apple would continue to offer updates on the iphone install base and total install base on a “periodic basis.” apple seems to be seeking bright spots wherever they can find them; the q1 2019 earnings didn’t deliver great news for the company despite beating already reduced market expectations. iphone revenues were down 15 percent. apple posts q1 revenue decline with iphone sales down 15 percent"
"apple is airing a new ad spot in primetime today. focused on privacy, the spot is visually cued, with no dialog and a simple tagline: privacy. that’s iphone. in a series of humorous vignettes, the message is driven home that sometimes you just want a little privacy. the spot has only one line of text otherwise, and it’s in keeping with apple’s messaging on privacy over the long and short term. “if privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on.” the spot will air tonight in primetime in the u.s. and extend through march madness. it will then air in select other countries. you’d have to be hiding under a rock not to have noticed apple positioning privacy as a differentiating factor between itself and other companies. beginning a few years ago, ceo tim cook began taking more and more public stances on what the company felt to be your “rights” to privacy on their platform and how that differed from other companies. the undercurrent being that apple was able to take this stance because its first-party business relies on a relatively direct relationship with customers who purchase its hardware and, increasingly, its services. this stands in contrast to the model of other tech giants like google or facebook that insert an interstitial layer of monetization strategy on top of that relationship in the forms of application of personal information about you (in somewhat anonymized fashion) to sell their platform to advertisers that in turn can sell to you better. turning the ethical high ground into a marketing strategy is not without its pitfalls, though, as apple has discovered recently with a (now patched) high-profile facetime bug that allowed people to turn your phone into a listening device, facebook’s manipulation of app store permissions and the revelation that there was some long overdue house cleaning needed in its enterprise certificate program. i did find it interesting that the iconography of the “private side” spot very, very closely associates the concepts of privacy and security. they are separate, but interrelated, obviously. this spot says these are one and the same. it’s hard to enforce privacy without security, of course, but in the mind of the public i think there is very little difference between the two. the app store itself, of course, still hosts apps from google and facebook among thousands of others that use personal data of yours in one form or another. apple’s argument is that it protects the data you give to your phone aggressively by processing on the device, collecting minimal data, disconnecting that data from the user as much as possible and giving users as transparent a control interface as possible. all true. all far, far better efforts than the competition. still, there is room to run, i feel, when it comes to apple adjudicating what should be considered a societal norm when it comes to the use of personal data on its platform. if it’s going to be the absolute arbiter of what flies on the world’s most profitable application marketplace, it might as well use that power to get a little more feisty with the bigcos (and littlecos) that make their living on our data. i mention the issues apple has had above not as a dig, though some might be inclined to view apple integrating privacy with marketing as boldness bordering on hubris. i, personally, think there’s still a major difference between a company that has situational loss of privacy while having a systemic dedication to privacy and, well, most of the rest of the ecosystem which exists because they operate an “invasion of privacy as a service” business. basically, i think stating privacy is your mission is still supportable, even if you have bugs. but attempting to ignore that you host the data platforms that thrive on it is a tasty bit of prestidigitation. but that might be a little too verbose as a tagline."
"the president has to remember a lot of names! some he remembers, some he forgets. but we will never forget today in the year of our lord 2019 when president trump called apple ceo tim cook “tim apple.” maybe we’re just losing our minds waiting for a good meme, but there’s something relentlessly good and pure about calling the executive formerly known as tim cook “tim apple.” tim cook: great guy, great phones. tim apple though? man, where do we start! in the video from cook’s appearance with the american workforce policy advisory board, trump invents tim apple at 1:03 before launching into a tirade on unspecified murders in mexico. “you’ve really put a great investment in our country. we really appreciate it very much, tim apple,” trump said. as the verge pointed out, trump once called lockheed martin’s ceo “marillyn lockheed,” which is fine, but not good and pure like tim apple. for evidence that trump in fact knows the “true” identity of tim apple, you can rewind to 40:43 when he calls the apple chief executive “tim cook” (his old name). usually it’s cheap to give someone a hard time for forgetting a name or making a minor mistake in extemporaneous speech. but tim apple is so much more than a mistake. if you’d prefer, watch the clip over and over again. we can’t recommend it enough. … here's the president of the united states calling tim cook, ceo of apple, ""tim apple."" pic.twitter.com/rtc45rfm5e — fake nick ramsey (@nick_ramsey) march 6, 2019"
"it looks like facebook was not the only one abusing apple’s system for distributing employee-only apps to sidestep the app store and collect extensive data on users. google has been running an app called screenwise meter, which bears a strong resemblance to the app distributed by facebook research that has now been barred by apple, techcrunch has learned. in its app, google invites users aged 18 and up (or 13 if part of a family group) to download the app by way of a special code and registration process using an enterprise certificate. that’s the same type of policy violation that led apple to shut down facebook’s similar research vpn ios app, which had the knock-on effect of also disabling usage of facebook’s legitimate employee-only apps — which run on the same facebook enterprise certificate — and making facebook look very iffy in the process. google’s screenwise meter app for iphones (images: google) after we asked google whether its app violated apple policy, google announced it will remove screenwise meter from apple’s enterprise certificate program and disable it on ios devices. the company said in a statement to techcrunch: “the screenwise meter ios app should not have operated under apple’s developer enterprise program — this was a mistake, and we apologize. we have disabled this app on ios devices. this app is completely voluntary and always has been. we’ve been upfront with users about the way we use their data in this app, we have no access to encrypted data in apps and on devices, and users can opt out of the program at any time.” screen(un)wise first launched in 2012, screenwise lets users earn gift cards for sideloading an enterprise certificate-based vpn app that allows google to monitor and analyze their traffic and data. google has rebranded the program as part of the cross media panel and google opinion rewards programs that reward users for installing tracking systems on their mobile phone, pc web browser, router and tv. in fact, google actually sends participants a special router that it can monitor. originally, screenwise was open to users as young as 13, just like facebook’s research app that’s now been shut down on ios but remains on android. now, according to the site’s panelist eligibility rules, google requires the primary users of its opinion rewards to be 18 or older, but still allows secondary panelists as young as 13 in the same household to join the program and have their devices tracked, as demonstrated in this video below (which was created in august of last year, underscoring that the program is still active). unlike facebook, google is much more upfront about how its research data collection programs work, what’s collected and that it’s directly involved. it also gives users the option of “guest mode” for when they don’t want traffic monitored, or someone younger than 13 is using the device. putting the not-insignificant issues of privacy aside — in short, many people lured by financial rewards may not fully take in what it means to have a company fully monitoring all your screen-based activity — and the implications of what extent tech businesses are willing to go to to amass more data about users to get an edge on competitors, google screenwise meter for ios appears to violate apple’s policy. this states, in essence, that the enterprise certificate program for distributing apps without the app store or apple’s oversight is only for internal employee-only apps. google walks users through how to install the enterprise certificate and vpn on their phone. developers seeking to do external testing on ios are supposed to use the testflight system that sees apps reviewed and limits their distribution to 10,000 people. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data we’ve yet to hear back from apple, but google moving quickly to cancel its ios screenwise meter might save it from further punishment. we’ll see if apple still invalidates the certifications for all of google’s legitimate employee-only apps that run using the same certificate the way it did to facebook. that would throw a wrench into google’s product development and daily work flow that could be more damaging than just removing one way it gathers competitive intelligence. but rather than taking seven hours to respond as backlash swelled like facebook, google managed to get things sorted in a little under three. we’ve updated this post throughout in response to google’s statement that it will shut down the ios version of screenwise meter. facebook’s vpn app puts spotlight on kids’ consent"
"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. we’re back! after what i think was our first-ever break, kate clark and i sat down to dig into the latest startup venture news. there was a lot. we had to skip a few rounds to squeeze the show down to size, but we still hit the biggest stories. first, lime and bird are raising again. in bird’s case, the company is sticking around its last valuation, adding a few hundred million to its coffers. lime is said to be raising a hundred million more, bringing its valuation in line with bird’s own. when all this is said and done, and what’s expected to happen actually does, bird and lime could add $700 million to their bank accounts, making both scooter shops double unicorns. next we tucked into the chariot shutdown. ford’s decision to shutter its bus-van-techie-transport startup that it bought back in 2016 was surprising news. (chariot vehicles have become a regular part of the san francisco cityscape over the years.) the company is shuttering its u.k. operations first, followed by its u.s.-based routes. pivoting back to our regular fare, slack’s financials partially leaked. early-2018-era projections aren’t the best tool for figuring out how a company is performing today, but it’s better than nothing. slack has lots of cash, is growing very quickly and is climbing toward the $500 million mark this year, if its old growth expectations hold up. (i tacked on palantir’s latest into this segment as well.) finally, the government is partially shut down as you’ve heard. it’s blocking ipo progress for a host of companies, many of whom come from tech. how long this pileup builds will determine how soon any tech shop can debut. it’s good to be back, and i promise to never mention peloton again. if for no other reason than making our beloved producer laugh is verboten. stay cool! equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."

"sales and marketing are steeped in data to explain just how well they are doing, but engineering, the department charged with creating the products these departments sell has lacked the tools to measure engineering effectiveness. pinpoint wants to change that by making engineering a more data-driven endeavor. today it announced a $13.5 million series a round. the round was led by bessemer venture partners with participation from seed investors storm ventures, boldstart ventures, bloomberg beta, slack fund, social capital and cherubic ventures. that’s quite a lineup of investors for an early-stage startup. perhaps that’s because the company was founded by a couple of industry veterans, jeff haynie and nolan wright, who co-founded appcelerator. that company was acquired by axway in 2016. one of the issues the two founders observed running a company was the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of their engineering group, and that there were a dearth of tools to help. sure if you were facebook, google, apple or similarly large organization, maybe you could create such a product in-house, but the founders saw that engineering groups at most companies lacked a centralized, data-driven approach to understand how well the group’s efforts aligned with the broader goals of the organization. so they did what all good entrepreneurs do, they started a company to do just that. taking advantage of machine learning, the company built an application that taps into engineering tools like jira and github to manage, understand and even predict engineering outcomes. the approach doesn’t actually require engineers to do anything differently. they simply use their regular systems of organization and connect pinpoint to them to gather data. team performance graph. screenshot: pinpoint it wasn’t an easy tool to build because they needed actual data to train the machine learning models. the company used its own engineering efforts and those of several design partners to help launch the product. the founders also recognized that companies may be reluctant to move their engineering data to the cloud, so they came up with a solution, using an open source agent that sits on the customer’s systems, and only moves metadata to the cloud. pinpoint was founded in 2016. it’s based in austin and currently has 25 employees. that is likely to increase fairly dramatically as they put today’s investment to use."
"nuvyyo, the makers of the tablo ota dvr aimed at cord cutters who want to watch and record live tv, just gave their dvr a big upgrade. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, the company launched a redesigned dvr called the tablo quad, a four-tuner dvr that now offers the option for an internal sata drive instead of only external usb drives. but the more exciting news is tablo’s new ability to automatically skip the commercials when you play back a recording. there’s not even a button to press – the software does it for you. the commercial-skipping feature is still in beta, and the company won’t get into its secret sauce too much here. we understand, however, that tablo is licensing the technology from a partner, as opposed to using something it built itself in-house. according to the company, it’s not using human labor to mark where shows end and commercials begin. instead, the tech is described as a “cloud-based hybrid of digital signal processing algorithms and machine learning.” to work, the shows are uploaded to the cloud, where the commercials are marked on the recording. it’s able to figure out which portions of a program are commercials because of how they’re filmed – with quick cuts, for example. that’s why it works well on a show like “big bang theory” but doesn’t work too well on your local news. still, the feature is notable because it’s automatic – you don’t have to worry with fast-forwarding or even pressing a commercial skip button, as on tivo. it also works across all timeslots and shows, for the most part – not only those airing during primetime. when the commercials are detected, tablo will skip past them in the tablo apps for roku, fire tv, android tv and apple tv, the company says. however, the feature is only available to tablo customers who pay for a subscription for their tablo ota dvr – including the quad as well as older devices. the tablo quad, like other tablo dvrs, offers an option guide data subscription service, which provides the episode and series synopsis, cover art, and metadata for programs airing over the next two weeks. it also includes access to advanced dvr features like one-touch recording and out-of-home streaming through tablo connect, as well the new commercial-skipping feature. the subscription is $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, depending on how you choose to pay. you can also opt for a one-time payment of $149.99 for lifetime service. tablo quad will be available in late q1 2019 at an msrp of $199.99. the commercial-skipping open beta will launch in march for any subscription-enabled tablo ota dvr."
"sunny dhillon contributor sunny dhillon is a partner at signia venture partners. more posts by this contributor digital influencers and the dollars that follow them amazon’s next conquest will be apparel animated characters are as old as human storytelling itself, dating back thousands of years to cave drawings that depict animals in motion. it was really in the last century, however — a period bookended by the first animated short film in 1908 and pixar’s success with computer animation with toy story from 1995 onward — that animation leapt forward. fundamentally, this period of great innovation sought to make it easier to create an animated story for an audience to passively consume in a curated medium, such as a feature-length film. our current century could be set for even greater advances in the art and science of bringing characters to life. digital influencers — virtual or animated humans that live natively on social media — will be central to that undertaking. digital influencers don’t merely represent the penetration of cartoon characters into yet another medium, much as they sprang from newspaper strips to tv and the multiplex. rather, digital humans on social media represent the first instance in which fictional entities act in the same plane of communication as you and i — regular people — do. imagine if stories about mickey mouse were told over a telephone or in personalized letters to fans. that’s the kind of jump we’re talking about. social media is a new storytelling medium, much as film was a century ago. as with film then, we have yet to transmit virtual characters to this new medium in a sticky way. which isn’t to say that there aren’t digital characters living their lives on social channels right now. the pioneers have arrived: lil’ miquela, astro, bermuda and shudu are prominent examples. but they are still only notable for their novelty, not yet their ubiquity. they represent the output of old animation techniques applied to a new medium. this techcrunch article did a great job describing the current digital influencer landscape. more investors are betting on virtual influencers like lil miquela so why haven’t animated characters taken off on social media platforms? it’s largely an issue of scale — it’s expensive and time-consuming to create animated characters and to depict their adventures. one 2017 estimate stated that a 60 to 90-second animation took about 6 weeks to create. an episode of animated tv takes between 1–3 months to produce, typically with large teams in south korea doing much of the animation legwork. that pace simply doesn’t work in a medium that calls for new original content multiple times a day. yet the technical piece of the puzzle is falling into place, which is primarily what i want to talk about today. traditionally, virtual characters were created by a team of experts — not scalable — in the following way: create a 3d model texture the model and add additional materials rig the 3d model skeleton animate the 3d model introduce character into desired scene today, there are generally three types of virtual avatar: realistic high-resolution cgi avatars, stylized cgi avatars and manipulated video avatars. each has its strengths and pitfalls, and the fast-approaching world of scaled digital influencers will likely incorporate aspects of all three. the digital influencers mentioned above are all high-resolution cgi avatars. it’s unsurprising that this tech has breathed life into the most prominent digital influencers so far — this type of avatar offers the most creative latitude and photorealism. you can create an original character and have her carry out varied activities. the process for their creation borrows most from the old-school cgi pipeline described above, though accelerated through the use of tools like daz3d for animation, moka studio for rigging, and rokoko for motion capture. it’s old wine in new bottles. naturally, it shares the same bottlenecks as the old-school cgi pipeline: creating characters in this way consumes a lot of time and expertise. though researchers, like ari shapiro at the university of southern california institute for creative technologies, are currently working on ways to automate the creation of high-resolution cgi avatars, that bottleneck remains the obstacle for digital influencers entering the mainstream. stylized cgi avatars, on the other hand, have entered the mainstream. if you have an iphone or use snapchat, chances are you have one. apple, samsung, pinscreen, loom.ai, embody digital, genies and expressive.ai are just some of the companies playing in this space. these avatars, while likely to spread ubiquitously à la bitmoji before them, are limited in scope. while they extend the ability to create an animated character to anyone who uses an associated app, that creation and personalization is circumscribed: the avatar’s range is limited for the purposes of what we’re discussing in this article. it’s not so much a technology for creating new digital humans as it is a tool for injecting a visual shorthand for someone into the digital world. you’ll use it to embellish your snapchat game, but storytellers will be unlikely to use these avatars to create a spiritual successor to mickey mouse and buzz lightyear (though they will be a big advertising / brand partnership opportunity nonetheless). video manipulation — you probably know it as deepfakes — is another piece of tech that is speeding virtual or fictional characters into the mainstream. as the name implies, however, it’s more about warping reality to create something new. anyone who has seen nicolas cage’s striking features dropped onto amy adams’ body in a superman film will understand what i’m talking about. open-source packages like this one allow almost anyone to create a deepfake (with some technical knowhow — your grandma probably hasn’t replaced her time-honored bingo sessions with some casual deepfaking). it’s principally used by hobbyists, though recently we’ve seen startups like synthesia crop up with business use cases. you can use deepfake tech for mimicry, but we haven’t yet seen it used for creating original characters. it shares some of the democratizing aspects of stylized cgi avatars, and there are likely many creative applications for the tech that simply haven’t been realized yet. while none of these technology stacks on their own currently enable digital humans at scale, when combined they may make up the wardrobe that takes us into narnia. video manipulation, for example, could be used to scale realistic high-res characters like lil’ miquela through accelerating the creation of new stories and tableaux for her to inhabit. nearly all of the most famous animated characters have been stylized, and i wouldn’t bet against social media’s snow white being stylized too. what is clear is that the technology to create digital influencers at scale is nearing a tipping point. when we hit that tipping point, these creations will transform entertainment and storytelling."
"apple’s new streaming service is poised to launch this spring, according to the information, citing three unnamed sources. tucked away in a report about amazon’s plans to dial down its efforts with its subscription video offering, the information noted that apple has been telling entertainment partners to be ready for a mid-april launch for the streaming service. but the report also said the actual launch date could be within several weeks of that time frame. a spring launch date would fall in line with earlier reports, which said apple’s video streaming service would launch in the first half of 2019. apple ceo tim cook also vaguely confirmed its plans in this area, when speaking with cnbc earlier this month. he said that apple would announce “material” new additions to its line of service offerings this year. these could include the upcoming news and magazine subscription service, which is also rumored for a spring arrival, and possibly new services in the health space. apple has been gearing up for its streaming service for some time, acquiring rights and making deals for a number of tv shows and movies — it even just brokered its first movie deal at sundance 2019 on monday. however, apple’s original content may not be the only thing to watch on the new service. apple may include an amazon channels-like offering as a part of its video service, the new report said. this, too, has been claimed previously by both bloomberg and cnbc. this amazon channels-like model has been copied throughout the competitive streaming market because of the low overhead and the big cut amazon and roku take on subscription sales — around 30 percent, the information says. for example, roku this week launched its own video subscriptions in the roku channel; sling tv rolled out a selection of premium à la carte channels last year; and media center software maker plex aims to do the same in 2019. walmart had been rumored to be entering this market via vudu, its video marketplace that’s now its key focus for competing on streaming. even facebook is considering an amazon channels-like offering, the report said. apple’s decision to move forward with a spring — or possibly, even mid-april — launch date would see its service going head-to-head with disney+, the disney-owned netflix competitor that will be shown off to investors on april 11. but what’s still unclear is how apple will be marketing and selling its streaming offering — reports have varied on this front, claiming everything from a bundle with apple music and news to being entirely free."
"siri, alexa, google assistant, cortana and bixby — almost all virtual assistants have something in common. their default voices are women’s, though the role that plays in reinforcing gender stereotypes has been long documented, even inspiring the dystopian romance “her.” virtue, the creative agency owned by publisher vice, wants to challenge the trend with a genderless voice called q. the project, done in collaboration with copenhagen pride, equal ai, koalition interactive and thirtysoundsgood, wants technology companies to think outside the binary. “technology companies are continuing to gender their voice technology to fit scenarios in which they believe consumers will feel most comfortable adopting and using it,” says q’s website. “a male voice is used in more authoritative roles, such as banking and insurance apps, and a female voice in more service-oriented roles, such as alexa and siri.” to develop q, virtue worked with anna jørgensen, a linguist and researcher at the university of copenhagen. they recorded the voices of five non-binary people, then used software to modulate the recordings to between 145-175 hz, the range defined by researchers as gender neutral. the recordings were further refined after surveying 4,600 people and asking them to define the voices on a scale from 1 (male) to 5 (female). virtue is encouraging people to share q with apple, amazon and microsoft, noting that even when different options are given for voice assistants, they are still usually categorized as male or female. as the project’s mission statement puts it, “as society continues to break down the gender binary, recognizing those who neither identify as male nor female, the technology we create should follow.”"
"sprint today announced it will support apple’s business chat — the new platform that allows businesses and customers to interact over imessage. according to the carrier, customers can now message a sprint customer service agent, get info about plans and other services, as well as look up store information in maps, safari and with siri during a chat session. the support from sprint comes after two other launches on the platform this week. td ameritrade said it will allow customers to fund their brokerage accounts using apple pay on apple business chat. and gubagoo said it will connect car dealerships with customers through business chat for viewing inventory, plus scheduling test drives and service appointments. apple has been steadily growing its list of supported business chat partners, and today has a number of big brands on its platform, which is still in beta. these include names like 1-800-contacts, dish, overstock.com, quicken loans, kimpton hotels, west elm, burberry, vodafone, wells fargo, credit suisse, jos a. bank, men’s warehouse, the home depot, hilton, four seasons, american express, harry & david and several others. the platform also supports integrations with customer service platforms liveperson, salesforce, nuance, genesys, inthechat, zendesk, quiq, cisco, kipsu, lithium, egain, [24]7.ai, contactatonce, dimelo, brand embassy, asapp, imimobile and messengerpeople, according to apple’s website. business chat was officially introduced at wwdc 2017, and is apple’s entry into the business messaging and chatbot space. before its arrival, customers would generally reach out to businesses through social media sites like facebook (e.g. pages and messenger, whatsapp and instagram) and twitter. but apple’s product gets the businesses even closer to the customer, as their chats can live alongside those from family and friends. plus, they don’t have to share their data with a third party. for consumers, reaching a business through imessage is also a bit easier at times. a company’s business chat profile is highlighted across apple’s ios platform in areas like safari, maps and spotlight, and via siri. this makes it more seamless to move from one apple app to an imessage chat, compared with having to seek out the business’s social media profile. it’s also less painful than having to dial a customer service phone number, in many cases — as sprint today pointed out. “more consumers are embracing quick and easy self-service and digital assistance versus calling customer service through an 800 line,” said rob roy, sprint chief digital officer, in a statement about the launch. “apple business chat is an amazing tool for our customers that makes communicating with sprint fast, easy and stress-free.” business chat has come at a time when the “phone” part of our smartphones is turning into just another “app” — and increasingly, a spammy and bothersome one thanks to spam calls. apple’s solution makes it easier for customers and businesses to move away from phone lines, while google is leveraging ai to handle spammers — and even place calls for customers through its google duplex technology."
"security researchers have found dozens of companies inadvertently leaking sensitive corporate and customer data because staff are sharing public links to files in their box enterprise storage accounts that can easily be discovered. the discoveries were made by adversis, a cybersecurity firm, which found major tech companies and corporate giants had left data inadvertently exposed. although data stored in box enterprise accounts is private by default, users can share files and folders with anyone, making data publicly accessible with a single link. but adversis said these secret links can be discovered by others. using a script to scan for and enumerate box accounts with lists of company names and wildcard searches, adversis found more than 90 companies with publicly accessible folders. not even box’s own staff were immune from leaking data. the company said while much of the data is legitimately public and box advises users how to minimize risks, many employees may not know the sensitive data they share can be found by others. worse, some public folders were scraped and indexed by search engines, making the data found more easily. in a blog post, adversis said box administrators should reconfigure the default access for shared links to “people in your company” to reduce accidental exposure of data to the public. adversis said it found passport photos, bank account and social security numbers, passwords, employee lists, financial data like invoices and receipts and customer data among the data found. the company contacted box to warn of the larger exposures of sensitive data, but noted that there was little overall improvement six months after its initial disclosure. “there is simply too much out there and not enough time to resolve each individually,” he said. adversis provided techcrunch with a list of known exposed box accounts. we contacted several of the big companies named, as well as those known to have highly sensitive data, including: amadeus, the flight reservation system maker, which left a folder full of documents and application files associated with singapore airlines. earlier this year, researchers found flaws that made it easy to change reservations booked with amadeus. apple had several folders exposed, containing what appeared to be non-sensitive internal data, such as logs and regional price lists. television network discovery had more than a dozen folders listed, including database dumps of millions of customers names and email addresses. the folders also contained some demographic information and developer project files, including casting contracts and notes and tax documents. edelman, the global public relations firm, had an entire project proposal for working with the new york city mass transit division, including detailed proposal plans and more than a dozen resumes of potential staff for the project — including their names, email addresses, and phone numbers. nutrition giant herbalife left several folders exposed containing files and spreadsheets on about 100,000 customers, including their names, email addresses and phone numbers. opportunity international, a nonprofit aimed at ending global poverty, exposed in a massive spreadsheet a list of donor names, addresses and amount given. schneider electric left dozens of customer orders accessible to anyone, including sludge works and pump stations for several towns and cities. each folder had an installation “sequence of operation” document, which included both default passwords and in some cases “backdoor” access passwords in case of forgotten passwords. pointcare, a medical insurance coverage management software company, had thousands of patient names and insurance information exposed. some of the data included the last four digits of social security numbers. united tissue network, a whole-body donation nonprofit, exposed body donor information and personal information of donors in a vast spreadsheet, including the prices of body parts. box, which initially had no comment when we reached out, had several folders exposed. the company exposed signed non-disclosure agreements on their clients, including several u.s. schools, as well as performance metrics of its own staff, the researchers said. box spokesperson denis roy said in a statement: “we take our customers’ security seriously and we provide controls that allow our customers to choose the right level of security based on the sensitivity of the content they are sharing. in some cases, users may want to share files or folders broadly and will set the permissions for a custom or shared link to public or ‘open’. we are taking steps to make these settings more clear, better help users understand how their files or folders can be shared, and reduce the potential for content to be shared unintentionally, including both improving admin policies and introducing additional controls for shared links.” the cloud giant said it plans to reduce the unintended discovery of public files and folders. amadeus, apple, box, discovery, herbalife, edelman and pointcare all reconfigured their enterprise accounts to prevent access to their leaking files after techcrunch reached out. amadeus spokesperson alba redondo said the company decommissioned box in october and blamed the exposure on an account that was “misconfigured in public mode,” which has now been corrected and external access to it is now closed. “we continue to investigate this issue and confirm there has been no unauthorized access of our system,” said the spokesperson, without explanation. “there is no evidence that confidential information or any information containing personal data was impacted by this issue,” the spokesperson added. when we asked amadeus how it concluded there was no improper access, another spokesperson, ben hunt, said: “we have the full audit trail for box and access of these files — none of the files have been downloaded outside of either amadeus or authorized customers.” the spokesperson declined to explain its statement when told files were downloaded to verify their contents. pointcare chief executive everett lebherz confirmed its leaking files had been “removed and box settings adjusted.” edelman’s global marketing chief michael bush said the company was “looking into this matter.” herbalife spokesperson jennifer butler said the company was “looking into it,” but we did not hear back after several follow-ups. (butler declared her email “off the record,” which requires both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were given no opportunity to reject the terms.) when reached, an apple spokesperson did not comment by the time of publication. discovery, opportunity international, schneider electric and united tissue network did not return a request for comment. data “dumpster diving” is not a new hobby for the skilled, but it’s a necessary sub-industry to fix an emerging category of data breaches: leaking, public and exposed data that shouldn’t be. it’s a growing space that we predicted would grow as more security researchers look to find and report data leaks. this year alone, we’ve reported data leaks at dow jones, rubrik, nasa, aiesec, uber, the state bank of india, two massive batches of indian aadhaar numbers, a huge leak of mortgage and loan data and several chinese government surveillance systems. adversis has open-sourced and published its scanning tool. here’s what to expect in cybersecurity in 2019"
"bad news from apple and signs of slowing international and domestic growth sent stocks tumbling in thursday trading on all of the major markets. investors erased some $75 billion in value from apple alone… an amount known technically as a shit ton of money. but stocks were down broadly based on apple’s news, with the nasdaq falling 3 percent, or roughly 202.44 points, and the dow jones industrial average plummeting 660.02 points, or roughly 2.8 percent. apple halted trading of its stock yesterday afternoon to provide lower guidance for upcoming earnings. apple lowers guidance on q1 results, cites china trade tensions apple’s news from late yesterday that it would miss its earnings estimates by several billion dollars thanks to a collapse of sales in china was the trigger for a broad sell-off that erased gains from the last trading sessions before the new year (which saw the biggest one-day gain in stocks in recent history). apple’s china woes could be attributed to any number of factors, d.a. davidson senior analyst tom forte said. the weakening chinese economy, patriotic fervor from chinese consumers or the increasingly solid options available from domestic manufacturers could all be factors. sales were suffering in more regions than china, forte noted. india, russia, brazil and turkey also had slowing sales of new iphone models, he said. apple stock has dropped 38 percent in 90 days investors have more than just weakness from apple to be concerned about. chinese manufacturing flipped from growth to contraction in december and analysts in the region expect that the pain will continue through at least the first half of the year. “we expect a much worse slowdown in the first half, followed by a more serious and aggressive government easing/stimulus centred on deregulating the property market in big cities, and then we might see stabilisation and even a small rebound later this year,” ting lu, chief china economist at nomura in hong kong, wrote in a report quoted by the financial times. u.s. manufacturing isn’t doing much better, according to an industrial gauge published by the institute for supply management. the institute’s index dropped to its lowest point in two years. “there’s just so much uncertainty going on everywhere that businesses are just pausing,” timothy fiore, chairman of ism’s manufacturing survey committee, told bloomberg. “no matter where you look, you’ve got chaos everywhere. businesses can’t operate in an environment of chaos. it’s a warning shot that we need to resolve some of these issues.” the index remains above the threshold of a serious contraction in american industry, but the 5.2-point drop from the previous month in the manufacturing survey is the largest since the financial crisis, and was only exceeded one other time — following the september 11, 2001 terror attacks on the u.s."
"microsoft’s seeing ai is an app that lets blind and limited-vision folks convert visual data into audio feedback, and it just got a useful new feature. users can now use touch to explore the objects and people in photos. it’s powered by machine learning, of course, specifically object and scene recognition. all you need to do is take a photo or open one up in the viewer and tap anywhere on it. “this new feature enables users to tap their finger to an image on a touch-screen to hear a description of objects within an image and the spatial relationship between them,” wrote seeing ai lead saqib shaikh in a blog post. “the app can even describe the physical appearance of people and predict their mood.” because there’s facial recognition built in as well, you could very well take a picture of your friends and hear who’s doing what and where, and whether there’s a dog in the picture (important) and so on. this was possible on an image-wide scale already, as you can see in this image: but the app now lets users tap around to find where objects are — obviously important to understanding the picture or recognizing it from before. other details that may not have made it into the overall description may also appear on closer inspection, such as flowers in the foreground or a movie poster in the background. in addition to this, the app now natively supports the ipad, which is certainly going to be nice for the many people who use apple’s tablets as their primary interface for media and interactions. lastly, there are a few improvements to the interface so users can order things in the app to their preference. seeing ai is free — you can download it for ios devices here."
"after raising $24 million in funding led by salesforce in april 2018, the startup ifttt — which provides an api platform so that people can create short scripts for apps to work together — has announced that its co-founder linden tibbets has stepped down as ceo after 10 years leading the company. chris kibarian, who most recently was the ceo of monster.com owner randstad digital ventures, has taken on the role, and joined the board in the process. tibbets, meanwhile, is staying on as ifttt’s chief design officer. kibarian is a self-described turnaround specialist who has worked across a diverse set of businesses. in addition to restructuring monster — a legacy from the first dot-com boom that was acquired for $429 million in 2016 — it got causes-based crowdfunding platform youcaring into fighting form under its private equity owner. (youcaring eventually bought generosity.com from indiegogo and then itself got acquired by gofundme.) at ifttt, his task will be to “realize ifttt’s full potential and become the connectivity platform trusted by every person and business in the world,” tibbets notes in a medium post. it’s notable that when ifttt announced $24 million in funding last year, it was the first infusion of money to come to the company in four years — a relatively long time in the world of silicon valley startups. in the interim the company had made a few moves to launch new products, including those generating revenue, but had largely operated without much fanfare or attention (a little like the functional premise of ifttt itself, to be honest). on the other hand, the startup has some strong investors who appear to be rooting for it. in addition to salesforce, its backers include ibm and the chamberlain group (best known for a variety of brands for automatic entry gates and garage door openers), fenox venture capital, andreessen horowitz, betaworks, greylock, nea, norwest, sv angels and more. and in another, if modest, sign of optimism, between 2014 and 2018 ifttt’s valuation went up. its current valuation, according to pitchbook, is $249 million, compared to its post-money valuation of just under $210 million in 2014. however, looking at the wider industry, you can see where ifttt may have stalled in its growth, or at least in realising its full potential, as tibbets puts it. tibbets writes that 2018 was “the best year in our company’s history” — noting record usage and over 700 services available for linking on its platform across verticals like retail, banking, food, automotive, government, health, education, and entertainment — but he doesn’t break out any specific usage numbers. last year, when it announced funding, the company said it had 14 million registered consumers (it did not disclose how many were active), 75 million applets since launch, more than 5,000 active developers building services and more than 140,000 building applets on the ifttt platform. products from google, microsoft, amazon, twitter, bmw, samsung, ibm, myq, and verizon are among those touched by ifttt scripts. however, the wider landscape for connecting different apps together (ifttt stands for “if this then that”) has been a tricky one to develop as a business. ordinary consumers — beyond early-adopting power users — may not be as likely to want to build such scripts (or “recipes” as ifttt once called them before rebranding to “applets”), and the most obvious integrations now often come as standard features in products or apps themselves. developers, meanwhile, may want to write their own scripts or use more sophisticated platforms that can provide deeper analytics or functionality around an integration. (for example, there are competing services like microsoft’s flow, and products that provide their own integration functionality that replace the need for using ifttt, such as alexa from amazon, even while there are also ways to write integration scripts for amazon products via ifttt.) “the biggest development in 2018 wasn’t growth in usage or our ecosystem, but growth for our business,” tibbets writes tellingly. “we found concrete validation that connectivity is a real challenge for any brand looking to grow and retain their customers.” i had thought that was actually ifttt’s mission from the start. more to the point, if kibarian can best figure out how to fit ifttt into the current market, then that might turn out to be the most lucrative applet of all."
"granted, this news is maybe a bit too late. samsung’s already sold out of the free galaxy buds it was throwing in with s10 pre-orders. that said, the new bluetooth earbuds are worth the $129 asking price, especially for galaxy device owners. as with many fellow s10 reviewers, i’ve been using the buds for about a week now. they happily hitched a ride in my ears from san francisco to barcelona and then back home to new york. and i’ve been digging them the whole time. this certainly isn’t samsung’s first wireless earbud rodeo, but frankly, it took the company taking more than a few pages out of apple’s playbook to get things right here. the galaxy buds are heavily inspired by the airpods’ simple “just works” approach to the category, bucking samsung’s tendency to overstuff products. that approach mostly works like a charm on handsets, but the best thing a set of earbuds can do is fade into the background. on that front, the galaxy buds work like a charm. the airpod comparisons are clear the moment you open the galaxy buds case the first time, triggering a dialog box on the screen of your galaxy device. like apple’s version, the headphones will work with any bluetooth device, but they work best with the company’s own products. ecosystems, people. for other android devices, you’ll need to download samsung’s smartthings or galaxy wearable apps for the proper effect. the charging case itself is a bit more bulky and bulbous than the airpods, but it’s certainly small enough to carry around in your jeans pockets. i also actually kind of prefer the pill shape to apple’s glide dental floss design. the case offers two other distinct advantages: there’s a charging light on the outside it can be wirelessly charged apple’s no doubt working on that latter bit with the airpods 2 (remember airpower?), but samsung’s beat the company to the punch here — and for that matter, with wireless powershare, which lets you charge the case by simply placing it on the back of the s10. that was one less cable i needed to pack. the battery should last you a while regardless. the buds are 58 mah each and the case is 252 mah. that should translate to six hours a go on the buds and seven hours with the case. i know i didn’t run out of juice during the day. the buds fit well and the silicon tips should ensure they fit more ear sizes. they also form a nice seal, keeping sound in and passively canceling out ambient noise. they’ll stay put pretty well — i didn’t have any issues keeping them on at the gym. the sound, tuned by samsung-owned akg, is solid. it’s not the best i’ve heard in a pair of wireless buds, but it’s perfectly fine for walking around and hitting the coffee shop. all in all, a nice little surprise from samsung, and a great addition to the galaxy ecosystem. perhaps they’re even good enough to convince samsung to drop the headphone jack — but hopefully not."
"lg has put out a gesture-heavy hint ahead of the annual unveiling of new smartphone hardware at the world’s biggest mobile confab, mobile world congress, which kicks off in a month’s time. the brief video teaser for its forthcoming mwc press event in barcelona, which was shared today via lg’s social media channels, shows a man’s hand swiping to change on-screen content, including the message “goodbye touch.” the title of lg’s teaser video includes the name “lg premiere,” which could be the name of the forthcoming flagship — albeit that would be confusingly similar to the mid-tier lg premier of yore. so, hopefully the company is going to make that last ‘e’ really count. beyond some very unsubtle magic wand sound effects to draw extra attention to the contactless gestures, the video offers very little to go on. but we’re pretty sure lg is not about to pivot away from touchscreens entirely. rather, we’re betting on some sort of leap motion -style gesture control interface being added to the front of the handset, using sensors to detect a hovering hand, for example — probably accompanied by heavy marketing about how filthy-with-germs phone screens are so it’s totally better you don’t actually touch them. safe to say, the idea looks terribly gimmicky. or, well, just terrible. this kind of stuff has been tried (and failed to stick) plenty of times before — as long ago as a decade, in the now no longer mobile-maker sony ericcson’s case. samsung also added a gesture feature, called air gesture, to some of its handsets more than five years ago — which lets smartphone users do things like wave to answer a call or swipe through air to scroll up. some of its smartphones also offer hands-free scrolling via facial tracking. yet smartphone users everywhere still seem as hooked as ever on actually fingering their touchscreens. and gesture-based interfaces have, fittingly enough, largely failed to stick. although you could view apple’s face id technology as a form of non-touch gesture control, as my tc colleague ingrid lunden suggests. albeit the primary point in that case is security/authentication, so it’s more than just a frictionless way to interact with a device without touching it. smartphone makers — and android oems especially — are under acute pressure to stand out in a fiercely competitive and growth-stalled market. so despite a flighty history for gesture interfaces on mobile, a bunch of hardware experiments look to be in play, such as whatever lg’s cooking. and that includes — as we noted earlier today — what’s now open flirtation with foldable tablet smartphones (see: xiaomi teased a double folder phone.) we’ll be on the ground in barcelona to bring you news of all the major hardware releases next month — including keeping an eye on whatever lg is preparing to unbox (but not actually touch) on february 24. so stay tuned. we just hope that another detail in lg’s description for the teaser video, in which it asks its followers whether they’re “prepared to get stunned by the lg premiere,” does not augur a highly potent new form of contactless haptic feedback."
"china is facing a challenging juxtaposition in the coming years: can the government remain in control of business and media while also opening up the country to the knowledge economy? china has uplifted more humans in a shorter period of time than any other country in the history of the planet. that mesmerizing growth engine, though, is starting to face an intense slog. economic growth has slowed considerably, and while there are vagaries to these indicators, it is clear that china needs to rebuild its economy as it migrates from industrials into services. the future (of course) is all the buzzwords that linger in silicon valley coffee shops: innovation, startups, and entrepreneurship, mixed in with some chinese flavors like indigenous technology development. china has designs to be the world-leader in semiconductors and artificial intelligence. to get there though, it needs to create the intellectual environment to push the frontiers of science and technology. you’re reading the extra crunch daily. like this newsletter? subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates. that’s the debate happening right now. on one side, you have this discussion from the new york times’ asia business columnist li yuan from this weekend. chinese entrepreneurs are supposedly fleeing the country and seeking safer waters as the government clamps down on dissent and further censors china’s already narrow internet. few are predicting a crash, but worries over china’s long-term prospects are growing. pessimism is so high, in fact, that some businesspeople are comparing china’s potential future to another country where the government seized control of the economy and didn’t ease up: venezuela. only one-third of china’s rich people say they are very confident in the country’s economic prospects, according to a recent survey of 465 wealthy individuals by hurun, a shanghai-based research firm. two years ago, nearly two-thirds said they were very confident. those who have no confidence at all rose to 14 percent, more than double the level of 2018. nearly half said they were considering migrating to a foreign country or had already started the process. minxin pei, a well-known writer on china’s business environment and politics, was quoted by yuan as saying: “it’s clear to the private businesspeople that the moment the government doesn’t need them, it’ll slaughter them like pigs. this is not a government that respects the law. it can change on a dime.” china’s government furiously denied the article’s contention, arguing in its international-focused mouthpiece that: because some western media’s always tend to smear or even subvert china’s political system. take chen tianyong’s story. with ulterior motives, the new york times tells stories of certain chinese individuals and then exaggerates the fact, thus declaring that there are serious problems in china’s economy and political system. this is their consistent practice and some foreign people who do not understand china will fall into the western media’s trap. chinese people always need to be on the alert for such ill-intentioned articles. (really, it’s fun to read the global times in the morning, in the way that taking a new york city subway at 8:15am on monday morning is fun). yet, for all the entrepreneurs supposedly leaving, business opportunities remain robust. china’s government announced a huge economic development plan to create a “greater bay area” region around guangdong, hong kong, macau and others to compete directly with california’s bay area (the lesser bay area: even better without high-speed rail!™). the goal is to build upon the region’s manufacturing prowess and increasingly turn it into a source for technology innovation. if the blueprint’s economic goals are achieved, the region would rival the united kingdom in economic size. but that’s a big “if.” few areas of the economy show the tension between openness and control better than the video game industry. china has once again stopped approving licenses for games in the country last week, after a brief session of approvals following last year’s nine-month long hiatus. tencent, which produces some of the country’s most popular games, has lost nearly a quarter of its value in the meantime, even while it puts new streaming rules into effect to try to please the government. china has incredible potential to lead in technology (and frankly beat the united states) if it can figure out how to open its economy, perhaps not to foreign competition, but at least to its own talent. yuan quotes several entrepreneurs saying that trump’s trade war with china may be the country’s last hope for a more open environment. trump’s delay implementing tariffs on china this weekend, though, highlights the danger of relying on external forces to push domestic change. only the chinese can rebuild china’s economy. across the strait, taiwan’s silicon valley is fizzling photo by keel via getty images becoming the next silicon valley is every government’s dream, although few seem capable of putting all the pieces together to make it happen. take taiwan, which has made innovation a key watchword as it attempts to survive in the penumbra of china’s overwhelming economy. it’s silicon valley plans are fizzling from lack of action and a stagnant economy according to a translated article in the taiwan gazette: but according to a member of the opposition chinese nationalist party (kmt), the agency’s goal is hindered by cumbersome business regulations and restrictive visas and work permits. “although [the government was] targeted to issue 2200 visas, the plan so far has disbursed a mere two,” said jason hsu, a kmt legislator with experience in taiwan’s innovation sector. hsu said the government has not succeeded in attracting any global entrepreneurs to the island since the plan was implemented. the agency has been slow to implement the asia silicon valley plan, prioritizing other aspects, or simply failing to match action with words. compounding taiwan’s global talent crunch is competition from china and the us, with graduates moving house to take advantage of higher wages and better employment opportunities. you can’t build an innovative economy if the talent can’t or won’t show up. u.s. slowing h-1b visas image by blue diamond gallery used under creative commons meanwhile, the united states has plenty of talent that wants to show up of course, but increasingly wants to prevent at least some of them from staying in the country. we previously talked about how the trump administration was attempting to simplify some elements of the h-1b process. now, uscis has released new data that shows a decline in the approval rate for h-1b visa applications. in 4q18 only 75% of h1-b applications were approved, compared to 83% and 92% in 2017 and 2016 respectively. the application process itself has also gotten more intensive, with reviewing agencies requesting additional evidence from roughly 60% of corporate applicants in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to 46% and 28% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the wall street journal noted that apple, microsoft and others had a 99% approval rate, while capgemini was much lower at 60%. maybe some of these applications are marginal, and protecting the wages of american workers is a fair compromise. more transparency here would be very helpful. but if the united states wants to maintain its technological edge, it needs smart and talented workers to congregate here. these new rates do not bode well. intel investing heavily to regain lost ground in the battle for chip supremacy photo via intel corporation written by arman tabatabai at a press event last week, intel’s newly appointed ceo bob swan reiterated the company’s strategy of investing heavily in growth markets outside of its core competencies. the company has taken heat for racking up its r&d bills, but swan insisted that the chip giant needs to spend that money after struggling in recent years to keep up with the industry’s transition to new technologies. intel invested nearly $30 billion last year in r&d with a focus on memory, 5g, and graphical processing units (gpus), which are seen as the best option for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and any use case needing strong parallelized processing capabilities. the ft quoted swan as saying : …“if we want to play in a much larger market we’re going to continue to invest more in r&d, there’s no question about that,” he said. “we don’t want to get too penny wise and pound-foolish so we don’t invest for the future.” traditional brand names chipmakers have lost dominant share by investing heavily in whatever was driving profits at the time, while ignoring emerging tech that has become the primary source of growth. intel is now paying for their failure to move sooner. are india’s nationalist policies creating a closed internet? photo by money sharma/afp/getty images written by arman tabatabai india is facing a similar dilemma to china on how open it wants to make its economy. india’s government announced draft policies that will dictate operational requirements for ecommerce, social, and messaging companies. following the country’s heightened focus around data localization, which we have discussed before, the set of proposals announced over the weekend would require internet companies to maintain locally-housed data centers and servers, impose a legal framework for regulating the movement of user data across borders, provide the government with access to company data stored abroad upon request, and force ecommerce websites or apps operating in india to have a locally registered business entity. at the same time, the government also announced plans to institute policies that would require social networking and messaging platforms to swiftly remove content deemed “unlawful” or threatening to the “sovereignty and integrity of india.” while the indian government is trying to take a hardline approach to avoid the misconduct that has followed the expansion of big tech, they’re also putting further pressure on companies that already face a tougher, more expensive operating environment behind india’s “national champion” policy push as we’ve harped on before. as india continues to move towards nationalist policies that make it difficult for companies to compete, a chinese-style closed and censored internet increasingly seems likely.

"samsung’s newest product launch happens next week, but already the korean tech giant has revealed its entire upcoming range of wearable devices that will seemingly be unveiled alongside the galaxy s10. that’s because the company’s galaxy wearable’s app was uploaded today with support for a range of unreleased products, which include wireless earbuds, a sports-focused smartwatch and a new fitness band. first reported by the verge — and originally noticed by @samcentraltech on twitter — the new wearables include a galaxy sport smartwatch, fitness bands galaxy fit and galaxy fit e and galaxy buds, samsung’s take on apple’s airpods. the devices have all been teased in various leaks in recent weeks, but this confirmation from the samsung app, deliberate or inadvertent, appears to all but confirm their impending arrival. that said, we really can’t tell too much about the respective devices based on the app, which just shows basic renders of each device. still, that might just be enough of a tease to general a little more interest in what promises to be samsung’s biggest consumer launch event of the year. the samsung unveiling comes days before mobile world congress, the mobile industry’s biggest event of the year — so expect to see new product launches coming thick and fast over the coming weeks. what to expect from mobile world congress 2019"
"when the government comes for your data, tech companies can’t always tell you. but thanks to a legal loophole, companies can say if they haven’t had a visit yet. that’s opened up an interesting clause that allows companies to silently warn customers when the government turns up to secretly raid its stash of customer data without violating a gag order it. under u.s. freedom of speech laws, companies can publicly say that “the government has not been here” when there has been no demand for data, but they are allowed to remove statements when a warrant comes in as a warning shot to anyone who pays attention. these so-called “warrant canaries” — named for the poor canary down the mine that dies when there’s gas that humans can’t detect — are a key transparency tool that predominantly privacy-focused companies use to keep their customers aware of the goings-on behind the scenes. where companies have abandoned their canaries or caved to legal pressure, cloudflare is bucking the trend. the networking and content delivery network giant said in a blog post this week that it’s expanding the transparency reports to include more canaries. to date, the company: has never turned over their ssl keys or customers’ ssl keys to anyone; has never installed any law enforcement software or equipment anywhere on their network; has never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure; has never provided any law enforcement organization a feed of customers’ content transiting their network. those key points are critical to the company’s business. a government demand for ssl keys and installing intercept equipment on its network would allow investigators unprecedented access to a customer’s communications and data, and undermine the company’s security. a similar demand led to ladar levison shutting down his email service lavabit when they sought the keys to obtain information on whistleblower edward snowden, who used the service. now cloudflare’s warrant canaries will include: cloudflare has never modified customer content at the request of law enforcement or another third party. cloudflare has never modified the intended destination of dns responses at the request of law enforcement or another third party. cloudflare has never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of its encryption at the request of law enforcement or another third party. it has also expanded and replaced its first canary to confirm that the company “has never turned over our encryption or authentication keys or our customers’ encryption or authentication keys to anyone.” cloudflare said that if it were ever asked to do any of the above, the company would “exhaust all legal remedies” to protect customer data, and remove the statements from its site. the networking and content delivery network is one of a handful of major companies that have used warrant canaries over the years. following reports that the national security agency was vacuuming up the call records from the major telecom giants in bulk, apple included a statement in its most recent transparency reports noting that the company has to date “not received any orders for bulk data.” reddit removed its warrant canary in 2015, indicating that it had received a national security order it wasn’t permitted to disclose. cloudflare’s expanded canaries were included in the company’s latest transparency report, out this week. according to its latest figures covering the second half of 2018, cloudflare responded to just seven subpoenas of the 19 requests, affecting 12 accounts and 309 domains. the company also responded to 44 court orders of the 55 requests, affecting 134 accounts and 19,265 domains. the company received between 0-249 national security requests for the duration, and didn’t process any wiretap or foreign government requests for the duration. amazon’s barely-transparent transparency report somehow gets more opaque"
"jake gyllenhaal, rene russo and writer-director dan gilroy — who worked together on the creepy crime thriller “nightcrawler” — have reunited for a new netflix original film, “velvet buzzsaw.” while “nightcrawler” wasn’t perfect, it was tense and unsettling, filled with eerily beautiful shots of nighttime la, plus a career-best performance from gyllenhaal. it’s hard to believe that the same team was responsible for the muddled “buzzsaw,” a film that tries to combine art-world satire and horror movie scares, ultimately failing on both counts. the setup involves the death of a mysterious artist, leaving behind a trove of strangely compelling paintings. soon, though, everyone involved in promoting or selling these paintings starts dying too. on the latest episode of the original content podcast, we’re joined by jon shieber to try to understand what went wrong here. the movie isn’t particularly funny or scary — instead, we’re stuck with obvious jabs at the hypocrisy of the art world, interrupted by boring, unimaginative death scenes. and while gyllenhaal is trying something in his portrayal of pompous art critic morf vandewalt, the results are more head-scratching than compelling. this episode isn’t just one long pan, though. we also offer our (considerably more positive) impressions of the netflix series “russian doll,” which stars co-creator natasha lyonne as a new yorker who keeps dying and repeating the night of her 36th birthday. and we discuss super bowl streaming numbers and new details about disney’s streaming service. you can listen in the player below, subscribe using apple podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice. if you like the show, please let us know by leaving a review on apple. you also can send us feedback directly.

"spotify has reportedly launched for some users in india today, with plans to officially launch on wednesday to everyone, variety, citing sources with knowledge of spotify’s plans, reports. update: it’s now official, spotify has announced its launch in india. what’s particularly interesting is that, just for india, spotify users who do not pay for a subscription can play any song on demand on mobile. there is also playlists for india and a “starring…” feature that includes music from bollywood movies. here’s a statement from spotify founder and ceo daniel ek: as spotify grows, our goal is to bring millions of artists and billions of fans together from every country and background. india has an incredibly rich music culture and to best serve this market, we’re launching a custom-built experience. not only will spotify bring indian artists to the world, we’ll also bring the world’s music to fans across india. spotify’s music family just got a whole lot bigger. spotify said it now has over 200 million users, of which 87 million are paying customers, and it is in 79 markets worldwide. the rest of our original post is below. for the first 30 days, spotify’s premium service will be free and then cost 119 rupees (about $1.67) per month. there are also single-day, weekly, monthly, three-month, six-month and annual plans. similar to other streaming services available in india, spotify will also offer a free, ad-supported product. spotify first announced its intent to launch in india last march. in november, spotify ceo daniel ek cited licensing situations as a roadblock to its launch. last month, spotify inked a global content deal with t-series, a leading indian film and music company with a catalog of more than 160,000 songs. as techcrunch’s sarah perez has noted, the indian market won’t be an easy one for spotify to win. that’s because spotify is up against local player gaana, which already has more than 80 million users, saavn and wynk, as well as the north american likes of google, apple and amazon. this launch is happening in light of spotify’s legal battle with warner music group. earlier this week, wmg asked an indian court to block spotify from being able to play music from its catalog. techcrunch has reached out to spotify and will update this story if we hear back. additional reporting from jon russell"
"when verizon stealthily launched a new startup called visible last year, it operated under a bring-your-own-device model — to sign up, you needed to already have an unlocked iphone, and visible would send you a new sim card. today, however, visible is announcing that it’s partnering with affirm and apple to sell iphones with 0 percent apr financing. it’s also launching android compatibility in beta testing (the carrier was ios-only until now), and is selling samsung galaxy s9 and s9+ devices. visible is one of several attempts by companies large and small to rethink the wireless carrier model. in this case, the service is backed by verizon (which owns techcrunch) and uses verizon’s 4g lte network, but it says it operates as an independent startup. as for what visible is actually offering, you pay $40 a month for unlimited text, voice, data and hotspot usage at speeds of up to 5 mbps. there’s no contract, no extra fees and you manage everything through an app on your phone. now, on top of that, visible is selling 11 different iphone models, along with two different samsung galaxy models. you can either pay the full price upfront or sign up for financing from affirm — which, again, has a 0 percent apr and, for some consumers, won’t require a down payment. verizon stealthily launched a startup offering $40-per-month unlimited data, messaging and minutes the company says there are no hidden fees (like an activation, sim card kit or restocking fee) either. when asked how visible is able to offer this kind of pricing, a spokesperson pointed to the company’s “all digital business model” — it has lower costs because it’s not paying for physical infrastructure like stores. in addition, visible is introducing a new program called visible protect, which covers you (and provides access to apple care) in cases of loss, theft or hardware damage after the manufacturer’s warranty expires. to do this, it’s partnering with assurant. pricing starts at $10 per month. “above anything else, service, quality of product, and simplicity are what matter most,” said visible ceo miguel quiroga in a statement. “from the start of our business, we wanted to set a new bar for the way things are done by re-defining and evolving wireless and the overall retail experience. with every new offering, including our 0% [apr] financing, no fees for device purchase, and visible protect, we will advance our mission of removing complicated barriers for all consumers.”"
"when you live with roommates or go out often with friends, it’s common for someone to front the payment — be that for utilities, the cable bill, rent or the restaurant bill — and have everyone else pay them back via cash, venmo or apple pay. but ysplit, a company launching out of y combinator, wants to make it so you never have to owe anyone ever again. it works by creating a virtual card that automatically deducts money from everyone’s bank account. so, the person who usually fronts the payment would instead use ysplit’s virtual card. “we front the payment and as we’re fronting payment, we’re ensuring everyone on the card has enough money,” ysplit co-founder tunde alao told techcrunch. “we authorize the payment and then charge everyone at the same time.” ysplit is totally free to users but makes money through interchange fees. since the payment happens through ysplit’s card, it’s able to charge the utility provider between 1.3 to 2 percent of the transaction. ysplit spun out of alao and his co-founders’ first startup, cluttr. while the three of them were interning at google, they shared a house and came up with the idea to help them organize their shared finances. “we created something to track how much we owed each other,” alao said. “it got quite popular in the u.k. but we realized we’re not solving any problem by helping people track how much they owe each other. we wanted to stop people from owing each other entirely.” cluttr, which alao said was similar to splitwise, was basically splitwise plus scheduling. splitwise allows you to easily track bills and other expenses with friends. there are numerous other apps that make it easy to track how much you owe someone, but few — if any — that let you so easily split the expenses upfront. ysplit is currently in closed beta with about 40 households using the product. after y combinator demo day next week, ysplit will roll out the app to an additional 500 people. ysplit is initially focused on utility payments for roommates, but plans to add additional service providers down the road. “it scales into a lot of situations,” alao said."
"it’s a weird quirk of the current generation of airpods: they support siri, but only if you double-tap one of the earbuds first. unlike with iphones, ipads, apple watches and homepods, you can’t just say “hey siri” and babble out your request. rumors have been floating around for a while suggesting that a new iteration of airpods — airpods 2, the rumor mill is calling them — would bring “hey siri” functionality. now a screen hiding in the latest ios beta seems to suggest the same. while it’s not a publicly accessible screen, guilherme rambo of 9to5mac managed to trigger the following prompt in the just-released ios 12.2 beta: (image credit: 9to5mac) “talk to siri with your airpods or iphone by saying ‘hey siri’,” it reads. its absence from the current generation of airpods presumably boils down to a matter of battery life. apple figured out how to make “hey siri” work with minimal impact on battery life with the iphone 6s, then broke down how it all works in a post on its machine learning journal in april of 2018. but to pull off the same trick in a tiny earbud — each having a battery capacity of 93 milliwatt hours, or roughly 1 percent of that of an iphone — is an entirely new challenge. for the first gen, it was just easier to let the headphones wait for that double-tap, queueing it up as a new selling point whenever apple figured out how to pull it off. rumors have also hinted at other features for the eventual airpods sequel, from waterproofing to sensors that help track health data. alas, no sneaky hidden prompts hinting at any of that have been found yet."
"french premium tv channel canal+ is facing increased competition from netflix in france. the company is trying to reinvent itself with a new over-the-top offering called canal+ séries. the new service is launching today. as the name suggests, canal+ séries is focused on tv series — you won’t find any movies on the streaming service. in addition to original content, canal+ has already signed distribution deals with american networks to distribute their shows in france (showtime, fx, etc.) — those shows will also be part of the streaming service. overall, there are around 150 series at launch, from hippocrate and engrenages to killing eve and twin peaks. retrouvez au lancement de canal+ séries, les @creationcanal avec @engrenages , #hippocrate, @versaillescanal , #platane, @guyanecanal … et bientôt #vernonsubutex. pic.twitter.com/aqcrb5nebt — groupe canal+ (@canalplusgroupe) march 11, 2019 when it comes to prices, the company wants to undercut netflix with aggressive pricing. you can subscribe for €7 per month ($7.90) to stream in hd and 4k on one screen at a time. for €10 and €12 per month ($11.20 and $13.50), you can stream on two and four screens at once, respectively. in france, netflix currently costs €8 for the basic package, €11 for hd and two screens, and €14 for 4k and four screens ($9.10, $12.50, $15.90). canal+ has been working on an ott streaming service for years, called mycanal. it’s one of the best ott services in france (with molotov). canal+ is taking advantage of mycanal to let you stream canal+ séries content in the mycanal app on your phone, tablet, computer, apple tv or android tv device. this is an interesting offer for canal+. the company still relies heavily on expensive subscription contracts with 12 months or 24 months of commitment — a throwback to the golden age of cable tv. the company can’t lose all those valuable subscribers and cannibalize its own offering. by focusing on tv series, canal+ can let users stream content right after they air. french law is restrictive when it comes to movie streaming, but not tv series. most movies on netflix in france are at least two or three years old, for instance. netflix recently announced that it has 5 million subscribers in france, a tiny bit more than canal+. with netflix’s recent price hikes and canal+ cheap tier, let’s see if it can boost canal+’s bottom line and shake things up in the french tv landscape."
"competition is the core of capitalism. competition between companies lowers prices — on average — and ensures that they are forced to innovate lest they lose their markets to others. competition between workers ensures that people strive to do their best work lest their jobs go to more qualified or faster or cheaper replacements. obviously, there is a spectrum here from lethargic monopoly to cutthroat competition that causes more problems than it’s worth (environmental damage in the hopes of cutting costs, fraud, deceit, etc.). drawing that line though is really, really hard though, and there are unfortunately not many non-academic discussions of how much competition is needed to spur innovation. so it was surprising to read an entire chapter about this dilemma comparing china and the u.s. in kai-fu lee’s book ai superpowers (yes, yes, i am dreadfully behind on this particular book review). while the book is about ai, lee is trying to undo american conceptions of chinese innovation early on in the text. yes, the country was once a copycat haven, but that has changed as the learnings of copying have led to originality: the first act of copying didn’t turn into an anti-innovation mentality that its creator could never shake. it was a necessary steppingstone on the way to more original and locally tailored technology products. in his narrative, american (tech) companies didn’t fail in china because they were incompetent, but rather because they never made the effort to localize: american public companies tend to treat international markets as cash cows, sources of bonus revenue to which they are entitled by virtue of winning at home. […] american companies treat china like just any other market to check off their global list. they don’t invest the resources, have the patience, or give their chinese teams the flexibility needed to compete with china’s world-class entrepreneurs. china’s entrepreneurs didn’t just learn how to build products quickly from their early copying, but also learned that they had to ferociously compete for markets: the sheer density of competition and willingness to drive prices down to zero forced companies to iterate: to tweak their products and invent new monetization models, building robust businesses with high walls that their copycat competitors couldn’t scale. lee’s ultimate point is that by focusing on markets instead of mission, chinese startups move far faster and more aggressively to seize opportunities. but that also means that there are can be thousands of startups all targeting the same market at the same time, which forces outside-the-box (read: quite possibly unethical or illegal) behavior in order to compete. “for these gladiators, no dirty trick or underhanded maneuver was out of bounds. they deployed tactics that would make uber founder travis kalanick blush.” i’ve talked a number of times about the “chinese think palo alto is dumpy” problem. but it bears repeating: competition is the key to a startup ecosystem. competition forces founders to move faster, to hire quicker, to make product decision with alacrity and otherwise to win their markets today and not a year from now. the best founders in silicon valley founders understand this, although this secret seems to be increasingly lost today. history, of course repeats. just yesterday, it was revealed that chinese caffeine chain luckin coffee received a $200 million loan from investment banks in prep for an ipo. from julie zhu and kane wu at reuters: the firm officially launched its business only in january last year and in july raised $200 million in its maiden funding round that valued it at $1 billion, making it one of the fastest-ever firms to make the ‘unicorn’ milestone. […] the loss-making firm has been expanding at breakneck speed with over 2,000 cafes opened and plans to open 2,500 this year – displacing starbucks as china’s largest coffee chain in the process. 15 months and larger than starbucks. that’s speed, and that’s how you compete. digging into the s1: jumia ipo has points for praise and pause pius utomi ekpei/afp/getty images written by arman tabatabai jumia grabbed headlines yesterday after the african e-commerce player filed for an ipo on the nyse. our writer jake bright covered the news and provided insightful context around jumia’s business model, its footprint, and the state of e-commerce in africa. with jumia en route to becoming africa’s first public tech company listed abroad, we dug into the company’s s-1 to get a better understanding of all its moving parts. generally, the story is pretty compelling: jumia is one of the largest pan-africa e-commerce businesses with a large and rapidly growing active user base that is positively levered at africa’s economic development and mobile adoption. while the company is burning cash and losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year, that’s hardly uncommon anymore. but one area that gave me pause was the company’s margin breakdown. to measure the economics and operating performance of the company’s core operations, jumia uses “platform contribution,” a metric it defines as gross profit — excluding revenue from services outside the core platform — subtracted by fulfillment costs from third-party logistics providers, primarily related to freight and shipping. using this metric, jumia’s platform contribution was about 9-11% of sales in 2017-18. however, jumia’s metric excludes fulfillment and delivery costs associated with jumia’s network of warehouses, their fulfillment employees, and other related expenses, with the logic being that these costs are fairly flat year-to-year and less indicative of the variable costs of the business. however, as an e-commerce logistics and delivery provider, the unaccounted for fulfillment costs seem at least relevant, if not core. if we were to include all jumia’s fulfillment expenses in the calculation, jumia’s platform contribution would actually be negative 5-11% in 2017-18. while thin to negligible margins aren’t unusual for scaling e-commerce platforms, jumia’s margins fall short of levels seen in past prospectuses from some of the e-commerce giants jumia looks up to. amazon, alibaba, and even jd.com all had at least a year of positive margins including total fulfillment costs at the time of their s-1s. (though to be fair here, none of the three companies are apples-to-apples comps — amazon’s s-1 was decades ago, alibaba operated on a completely different scale at the time of its ipo, and jd.com used a different model focused on direct sales). still, the numbers here are just a little unnerving within the context of africa’s previous e-commerce failures, as discussed by jake bright: “jumia’s move to go public comes as several notable consumer digital sales startups have faltered in nigeria… …in late 2018, nigerian online sales platform dealdey shut down. and techcrunch reported this week that consumer-focused venture gloo.ng has dropped b2c e-commerce altogether to pivot to e-procurement. the ceo cited better unit economics from b2b sales. jumia also competes with services backed by amazon and naspers in several of its markets, which can be daunting when competing on economics. the other disclosure that had me harping on jumia’s fulfillment expense was in the “risk factors” section, where the company highlighted that it operates in markets with under-developed physical, economic, legal, and institutional infrastructure. and while there’s heavy investment going into african infrastructure — which could act as a growth tailwind for jumia in the long-run — improving, let alone creating, infrastructure takes much longer than doing the same in normal business operations, as we’ve discussed ad nauseam. because of the lack of infrastructure, jumia openly discusses the difficulties of delivery and stable fulfillment in its markets and has had to build out a lot of operational infrastructure itself. to me, it at least raises questions around how quickly jumia will be able to get its cost structure down and whether it might take a bit longer compared to some of its global e-commerce peers. thanks to every member of extra crunch: thank you. you allow us to get off the ad-laden media churn conveyor belt and spend quality time on amazing ideas, people, and companies. if i can ever be of assistance, hit reply, or send an email to danny@techcrunch.com. this newsletter is written with the assistance of arman tabatabai from new york"
"as schools continue to look for new ways to cut costs while at the same time reboot their curriculum to better tap new innovations and improved understandings of how children learn, e-learning startups are attracting attention, both from educators and the vcs that fund them to fuel growth. in the latest development, newsela — which has created a platform that packages together different third-party content like primary-source documents, news articles and more to help teachers and students learn about a particular subject, more or less as a replacement for more traditional textbooks — has announced that it has raised $50 million in a series c round of funding led by tcv. the new york-based startup said that it plans to use the money to get more penetration within the schools where it is already being used, as well as continue expanding the subject areas that it covers. the company — which currently focuses primarily on k-12 but does cover other learning environments like english-as-a-second-language courses and adult education — covers mostly social sciences, science and english, but also some math. it currently has more than 20 million students and 1.8 million teachers using its the platform, and says that it has usage already in some 90 percent of all schools in the us. the startup is not talking valuation, but as a rough guide, prior to this, newsela had raised about $38 million and was valued at about $82 million in its previous round, according to pitchbook, with some notable backers already on its cap table, including the chan zuckerberg initiative and kleiner perkins, as well as education-focused funds like owl ventures, reach capital and new schools venture fund. it’s a long way to come for a company that was founded, matthew gross (ceo) and dan cogan-drew (the chief product officer), two educators who cut their teeth working in more traditional environments, including via teach for america. newsela first got its start, as you might guess from the name, aggregating interesting news articles that could be used to supplement learning plans around particular subjects, with a specific focus on “ela” — english and language arts. it was after a year in beta that it started to see that there was potential to expand outside of that focus and into adjacent areas. “we’ve outgrown our name,” gross said. the company, founded in 2012, was born out of the idea that computers — used not just for learning coding, but for doing research and communications — have become a cornerstone of how children get information today in the classroom. broadband penetration in schools is now at over 90 percent (compared to 30 percent when newsela first started). and with many schools in the us already equipping each student with a dedicated laptop, that presented an opportunity to rethink how they could be used to harness a wider and more fluid set of materials than what students might be able to get out of a traditional textbook. the material shift in learning comes at a time when we are tapping the internet as the first port of call for all our information outside the classroom. we carry a library in our pockets, and those in a classroom can use their screens to view the us constitution, a specific work of art, the sequence of battles in the civil war and writings from people at the time, modern takes on what a financial crisis in the past might have indicated, or new scientific discoveries. “we can see an unprecedented opportunity to rethink content,” gross said. “textbooks are being pushed aside, and even where they are still being used, many are no longer making textbooks core curricular purchases.” and the shift to interactive also means that other things can now also be measured. “educators are looking for more engagement in their learning outcomes,” he added. indeed, that has had a big knock-on effect already in the textbook publishing world. just last month, pearson sold its entire k-12 textbook division to a pe firm, nexus capital management, in a fire sale: for $25 million plus $225 million in the form of a vendor note due in the next three to five years, with the understanding that nexus may also sell it (in which case pearson would get a cut). pearson said that it will be focusing its education publishing efforts now on digital. gross estimated to me that the textbook market, however, is a $10 billion business annually in terms of collective budgets that are allocated for buying them, which represents a big market for it — and others looking to replace textbooks, including the publishers themselves — to tackle. the format that newsela follows is flexible depending on what is needed by the customer (the school): it provides a set of materials that are constructed around learning a particular subject. but it doesn’t create the coursework around that: this is left to teachers, departments, schools and districts to build. sometimes a district will provide newsela with a more targeted request of what it would like to see covered, and newsela will build a collection to those parameters, gross told me. that is one area it wants to grow. what newsela does behind the scenes is work with more than 100 different sources that have inked licensing agreements with the startup. the licenses allow newsela to republish content on its own platform, and also rewrite content into five levels that are adaptive to age, reading ability and so on. it’s work that would be very time-consuming, and potentially expensive (or even cost-prohibitive), for individual teachers, schools and districts to do on their own. working with a team of editors, newsela gives educators the assurance that there has been some vetting done to provide accurate and complete sets of materials. “it’s a wild world when they search in a google box,” gross said of the challenges to be able to predict a consistent level of quality in results and resources when people sometimes turn to the internet to build similar bundles of content on their own. all of this comes at a price. there is a free tier of newsela that provides the ability to browse and assign content; create classes and give students access to that content, alongside quizzes and activities. two further paid tiers provide a number of extra features. one, teacher-focused, covers monitoring reading activity and quiz scores, assignment planning, annotations, writing prompts, and more teaching resources. the second aimed at schools and districts adds admin visibility, teacher training, live support, and more customised learning plans. in both paid tiers, newsela does not publicly disclose pricing.  the expansiveness of the platform, and future potential of where it can go, are two reasons why tcv — which has backed the likes of capella education, open english and varsity tutors in the education sector, but also very huge consumer internet startups like airbnb, facebook, linkedin and netflix — was interested in backing newsela. “at tcv we focus on finding transformative edtech companies, and newsela has proven to be a tool that boosts learning outcomes,” said woody marshall, general partner at tcv, in a statement. “our investment will help extend the platform and make it more accessible and even more valuable to students, teachers, and administrators. we are especially excited by the great engagement and feedback that newsela already has with their users.” marshall is joining the board with this round. newsela is far from being the only edtech startup that has tapped money from the vc world to grow. in the k-12 sector alone, others have included byju’s in india, which is now valued at over $4 billion (and just this week appears to have started to raise more money from tencent and general atlantic); classdojo; age of learning; vipkid, and kahoot to expand their businesses amid a surge of interest from students, parents and teachers. at newsela, meanwhile, gross said the startup is hiring and has grown staff 50 percent in the last year, and expects to grow as much again this year. “we might have attracted more interest if we had raised $100 million instead of $50 million,” he said in a comment about what seems to turn people’s heads in the tech world these days, “but we happen to be a very capital efficient business, and we heeded a warning i got early on not to raise more than what you really need. we’re proud of being a fiscally sound business that is also mission driven, and making an impact.” that doesn’t rule out raising more for m&a, he added, or indeed fielding inbound interest themselves: the company has already been approached by interested parties, although he declined to say who. but when you consider that education publishers are all looking for their next move to serve the classroom of the future; and tech companies like google, amazon, apple and microsoft have all made huge plays to court the education sector, the longer-term picture is a bright one for newsela."

"amazon’s formidable presence in the world of retail stems partly from the fact that it’s just not a commerce giant, it’s also a tech company — building solutions and platforms in-house that make its processes, from figuring out what to sell, to how much to have on hand and how best to distribute it, more efficient and smarter than those of its competition. now, one of the startups that is building retail technology to help those that are not amazon compete better with it, has raised a significant round of funding to meet that challenge. relex — a company out of finland that focuses on retail planning solutions by helping both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce companies make better forecasts of how products will sell using ai and machine learning, and in turn giving those retailers guidance on how and what should be stocked for purchasing — is today announcing that it has raised $200 million from tcv. the vc giant — which has backed iconic companies like facebook, airbnb, netflix, spotify and splunk — last week announced a new $3 billion fund, and this is the first investment out of it that is being made public. relex is not disclosing its valuation, but from what i understand it’s a minority stake, which would put it at between $400 million and $500 million. the company has been around for a few years but has largely been very capital-efficient, raising only between $20 million and $30 million before this from summit partners, with much of that sum still in the bank. that lack of song and dance around vc funding also helped keep the company relatively under the radar, even while it has quietly grown to work with customers like supermarkets albertsons in the u.s., morrisons in the u.k. and a host of others. business today is mostly in north america and europe, with the u.s. growing the fastest, ceo mikko kärkkäinen — who co-founded the company with johanna småros and michael falck — said in an interview. while the company has already been growing at a steady clip — kärkkäinen said sales have been expanding by 50 percent each year for a while now — the plan now will be to accelerate that. relex competes with management systems from sap, jda and oracle, but kärkkäinen said that these are largely “legacy” solutions, in that they do not take advantage of advances in areas like machine learning and cloud computing — both of which form the core of what relex uses — to crunch more data more intelligently. “most retailers are not tech companies, and relex is a clear leader among a lot of legacy players,” said tcv general partner john doran, who led the deal. significantly, that’s an approach that the elephant in the room pioneered and has used to great effect, becoming one of the biggest companies in the world. “amazon has driven quite a lot of change in the industry,” kärkkäinen said (he’s very typically finnish and understated). “but we like to see ourselves as an antidote to amazon.” brick-and-mortar stores are an obvious target for a company like relex, given that shelf space and real estate are costs that these kinds of retailers have to grapple with more than online sellers. but in fact kärkkäinen said that e-commerce companies (given that’s also where amazon primarily operates too) have been an equal target and customer base. “for these, we might be the only solution they have purchased that has not been developed in-house.” the funding will be used in two ways. first, to give the company’s sales a boost, especially in the u.s., where business is growing the fastest at the moment. and second, to develop more services on its current platform. for example, the focus up to now has been on-demand forecasting, kärkkäinen said, and how that effects prices and supply, but it would like to expand its coverage also to labor optimisation alongside that; in other words, how best to staff a business according to forecasts and demands. of course, while amazon is the big competition for all retailers, they potentially also exist as a partner. the company regularly productizes its own in-house services, and it will be interesting to see how and if that translates to amazon emerging as a competitor to relex down the line."
"huawei has decided to go on the legal offensive against the united states government after defending itself against alleged espionage and bank frauds linked to american sanctions on iran. during a press conference late wednesday, huawei announced that it has filed a lawsuit against the u.s. government, arguing that a ban on the use of its products by federal agencies and contractors violated due process and is unconstitutional. the company is the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment and a growing threat to apple in the global smartphone race. at the center of the suit, which was filed with a federal court in huawei’s u.s. home base of texas, is the company’s claim that section 889 in the national defense authorization act, passed in august 2018, is unconstitutional. section 889 contains restrictions that prevent federal agencies from procuring huawei equipment or services, working with contractors that use huawei equipment or services or awarding grants and loans that would be used to procure huawei products. during today’s press conference, huawei‘s rotating chairman guo ping said congress has failed to provide evidence to support the restrictions or allowed huawei due process of law. the company is seeking a permanent injunction against the restrictions. “for three decades, we have maintained a solid track record in security,” said guo. “huawei has not and never installed backdoors and we will never allow others to install backdoors in our equipment. the u.s. government branded our services a threat. the u.s. government has never provided any evidence supporting their accusations that huawei poses a serious security threat. the u.s. government is sparing no effort to smear the company. even worse, it is trying to block us in other countries.” u.s. officials have long warned domestic companies and other governments against using huawei equipment over threats that china could be using its tech for spying. a law passed in 2017 requires all organizations and citizens to “support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.” huawei’s legal action compares with a reconciliation reached between its rival zte and the u.s. government last year. the u.s. announced in july that it would lift a ban preventing zte from selling to american suppliers after zte agreed to pay a $1 billion fine. the penalty followed an investigation showing that the chinese maker of telecommunications devices had violated u.s. sanctions by doing business with iran and north korea. growing threats concerns around huawei have escalated as the chinese company grows to play a key role in 5g, the network solution crucial to driverless cars, remote surgeries and other futuristic technologies. in the backdrop is china’s ambition to lead the global 5g evolution, which has seen beijing fast-track the issuance of 5g commercial licenses to spur consumer interests. earlier this year, the u.s. justice department filed criminal charges against huawei and its financial executive meng wanzhou over business practices that allegedly circumvent u.s. sanctions over iran. meng announced this week she is suing the canadian government and police for violating her rights when they detained her on behalf of the u.s. government in december. huawei executives, including founder ren zhengfei, who rarely speaks out publicly, have firmly denied the presence of any backdoors in its equipment. ren recently declared that the u.s. won’t hamper his company’s trajectory and that the arrest of meng — his daughter — is a “politically motivated act [that] is not acceptable.” the huawei controversy comes as the u.s. and china are engaged in a prolonged trade dispute. critics have warned that escalating tensions between the world’s largest economies could strangle innovation breakthroughs, as countries around the world become increasingly reliant on china for investment, supply chain resources and skilled labor, while many of them depend on the u.s. for security alliance. update (march 7, 2019, 11:30 am): added context on zte and trade war."
"somewhere out there is a person willing to pay $2,500 for a smartwatch. surprisingly, that individual has several high-end options from which to choose. and while the garmin name doesn’t exactly scream luxury, the company does know how to build a solid smartwatch — and these look pretty decent, to boot. maybe not $2,500 decent, but decent nonetheless. the marq gps line puts the company in relatively rare air, with devices starting at $1,500. asking people to spend luxury watch prices on a smartwatch is a pretty heavy lift, of course. at well over three times the cost of an apple watch, you’re going to want the thing to last for…well, a long time. to make things even nichier, each watch is targeted at a very specific audience, including athletes, hikers, boating enthusiasts, pilots and race car drivers (that last one is the $2,500, mind). they all offer a specific design and feature set tailored to those categories, including faces that show off wind speed and a built-in altimeter. here’s garmin on why the things are so damn expensive: each watch is built with titanium, which is lightweight, yet incredibly strong for high performance in all activities, and are constructed with sapphire crystal formed under extreme heat and pressure to create an extremely durable lens that’s over twice as hard as glass. of course, garmin’s always been a bit of an underdog in the smartwatch wars, courtesy of devices targeted specifically at outdoors folks and athletes, so a targeted audience has always been the company’s m.o. though even for them, $1,500 and up is almost certainly pushing it. the watches will be available later in q2."
"apple sent out invites to reporters this afternoon for a march 25 special event at the steve jobs theater in cupertino. reports have suggested that the company will focus its keynote on the content side of its business. the invite offers some pretty heavy-handed hints that the video content service will be on full display at the event, mainly a film reel countdown timer that eventually reveals the phrase “it’s show time.” here's a gif of the animation pic.twitter.com/yd3qzli9kf — matthew panzarino (@panzer) march 11, 2019 apple has been seeding a ton of tv shows and delivering plenty of announcements about the content that it has in the pipeline, but we’ve strangely heard quite little about the underlying platform or subscription that apple has planned beyond media reports. there’s also been some discussion about a subscription business for apple news being announced here, but given the somewhat overt marketing references to the video service, the news product might either not be quite ready or could be playing second fiddle to the video announcements. speaking of back burner, hardware announcements feel unlikely, though airpower and a second-generation airpods feel long overdue."
"we’re coming to you with another episode of mixtape, the techcrunch podcast that takes a peek behind the headlines that go beyond tech. this week, megan rose dickey and i get into a discussion about women’s sexuality, because the world’s biggest “consumer electronics show” revoked an innovation award from lora dicarlo, a company that created a sex toy for women. in its initial objection, the cta cited a clause that entries they believed “in their sole discretion to be immoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with the cta’s image will be disqualified.” that’s not great. of course it walked the comments back, saying that the product, called osé, didn’t fit into an existing product category. except that the product falls squarely in the robotics category. we also discussed robot delivery dogs, because those things don’t seem like they’re ever going to go away. and finally, people continue to do stupid “bird box” challenges based on dumb ideas they have after watching netflix’s hit movie starring sandra bullock. stop it. click play above to listen to the full episode. and if you haven’t subscribed yet, get on over to your favorite podcast platform, whether it be apple podcasts, stitcher, overcast, castbox or whatever else you use."
"one of china’s top smartphone brands vivo appears to have joined its fellows oppo, huawei and xiaomi in setting up a new sub-brand as a softening market and heightened competition at home drive players to venture upon their original reach. a new smartphone brand called iqoo made its debut on weibo, china’s answer to twitter, on tuesday by greeting in english: “hello, this is iqoo.” it also playfully encouraged people to guess how its name is pronounced, as the spelling doesn’t resonate with either chinese or english speakers. vivo immediately reposted iqoo’s message, calling iqoo a “new friend.” vivo has not further revealed its ties with iqoo, although the latter’s weibo account is verified under vivo’s corporate name. techcrunch has contacted vivo and will update the story when we have more information. screenshot of iqoo’s first weibo post sub-brands have become a popular tactic for chinese smartphone makers to lure new demographics without undermining and muddling their existing brand reputation. as the third-ranked player by shipments in 2018 according to research firm counterpoint, vivo is the only one in china’s top five smartphone companies without a subsidiary brand. “sub-brands can help fill the gap in parent companies,” counterpoint’s research director james yan told techcrunch. “i think iqoo is a brand born for the gaming market, the online sales channel, or young consumers, similar to what honor did to huawei.” huawei cemented its top spot with solid growth in shipments last year by playing a two-pronged strategy. its sub-brand honor has its eyes on the mid-range and huawei stays at the top end. vivo’s sibling oppo, which falls under the same electronics manufacturing outfit bbk, came up with an exclusively online brand realme in 2018 to go after xiaomi’s redmi in india’s burgeoning smartphone market. xiaomi pressed on by launching poco for india’s high-tier market. to further solidify its multi-faceted approach, redmi shed the xiaomi branding in january to start operating as an independent brand focusing on cost efficiency. these moves arrived as years of breakneck growth in china’s smartphone space comes to an end. overall smartphone sales contracted 11 percent in 2018 according to counterpoint, as users become more pragmatic and less likely to upgrade their handsets. local players reacted swiftly by going global and introducing headline-grabbing features like xiaomi’s folding screen and honor’s pole-punch display, putting a squeeze on global players apple and samsung. in 2018, huawei shored up a 25 percent market share to take the crown. trailing behind was oppo, vivo, xiaomi and apple . samsung plunged 67 percnet to take seventh place."
"in august 2018, spotify became samsung’s go-to streaming music service provider following a strategic partnership between the two companies that initially focused on bringing spotify to samsung smart tvs and a deeper connection with samsung’s assistant technology, bixby. today, timed alongside the retail launch of samsung’s galaxy s10, the companies are expanding their partnership to make spotify a pre-installed application on a range of samsung devices, including the new galaxy s10, s10+, s10e and s10 5g, as well as the galaxy fold and some of samsung’s lower mid-range galaxy a devices. in addition, u.s. consumers buying the new galaxy s10 will qualify for six months of free spotify premium access if they’re new customers, spotify said. the two companies had not offered many more details about their partnership plans since the announcement last year, saying only that a lot of discussions were taking place as to what’s next. however, a move to pre-install spotify on samsung phones was likely under consideration from day one — especially after the 2016 failure of samsung’s own milk music streaming service, which meant it no longer had its own direct answer to apple music. at the time of milk music’s closure, samsung said it would shift to investing in a partner model for integrating the “best” music services onto its galaxy family of devices. picking spotify as a key strategic partner made sense, as it’s a clear frontrunner in the space and one that’s not operated by a tech giant like google’s youtube music/google play music, apple music or amazon music. (however, samsung and youtube also announced a joint deal today where samsung galaxy s10 owners get 4 free months of ad-free youtube and youtube music.) the spotify-samsung partnership not only means that spotify now gets deeper integration on devices and services, like bixby, it could potentially allow the two companies to work together on under the hood, cross-platform integrations, as well. this could benefit spotify’s ambitious podcasting plans, as listeners could pick up where they left off as they switch between devices. that wouldn’t have necessarily been possible without a device partnership like this. spotify says the expanded samsung partnership will see the music service pre-installed on “millions” of samsung devices worldwide, starting today, march 8, 2019. “we were very excited to be named samsung’s go-to music streaming service several months ago and today’s news will only ensure a more seamless spotify listening experience across devices for listeners around the world,” said sten garmark, vp of consumer products, spotify, in a statement. “this partnership makes it easy for samsung mobile users to access their favorite music and podcasts on spotify, wherever they are and however they choose to listen.”"
"zeta global, the well-funded marketing technology company founded by ceo david a. steinberg and former apple ceo john sculley, has hired its first chief privacy officer — ben hayes, who was previously chief privacy officer at nielsen. steinberg said the company already has a “global privacy team” and has been taking the issue “very seriously.” however, he said that by hiring hayes, he’s hoping to make zeta a “global thought leader.” “we want to send a message to the world that the end users that hit our platform are important to us, your privacy is important to us,” he said. and he noted, “when we sit down with our customers — and these are very, very large customers — the first two things they always want to talk about are data security and data privacy.” for his part, hayes said zeta is “poised to deliver a unique value to the marketplace and, in my estimation, disrupt multiple industries in so doing.” he also said he was impressed by zeta’s approach to protecting user data, specifically the fact that “it’s not a data broker.” in other words, even though it helps marketers target customers based on user data, it’s not selling that data to others. i wondered whether that distinction might get lost in the broader backlash against the way online companies vacuum up personal data, but hayes said, “i believe that paranoia grows in the shadows and the privacy backlash is largely about people feeling a loss of control over their data.” “explaining the value proposition to users is crucially important,” he added. “people are rational. if they understand it to be a net benefit to themselves they will like that thing.” marketing tech company zeta global raises $140m at a $1.3b valuation"
"google’s latest effort to help users monitor and control their screen time, digital wellbeing, is making its way to more devices. initially available exclusively to pixel and android one device owners, digital wellbeing’s feature set is now rolling out to nokia 6 and nokia 8 devices with android pie, as well as on the new samsung galaxy s10. the site nokiapoweruser was first to spot the addition to nokia devices, which was picked up by xda developers and noted on their blog. xda also noticed digital wellbeing was available in the samsung galaxy s10‘s device settings, which makes it the first non-pixel or non-android one phone to ship with digital wellbeing installed. digital wellbeing, by way of background, is basically google’s version of apple’s screen time, and one of the key ways the company is addressing consumer concerns over device addiction. this has been a hot topic in the tech industry in recent months, as people have become more aware of unhealthy behaviors with regard to use of smartphones and their apps. in fact, a number of those involved with mobile apps’ creation have since come out to say that they were complicit in building apps that exploited weaknesses in the human psyche for the sole purpose of addicting users. one former google exec, tristan harris, kicked off a whole movement focused on this problem. he also created the center for humane technology, which encourages the implementation of new design principles that help put users back in control of their technology. in the meantime, companies are rolling out features to give us control over our behaviors around existing technology. for example, facebook last year changed how its news feed operates to reduce time spent on its site in favor of well-being. and facebook-owned instagram introduced a time well spent feature, by informing users “you’re all caught up” instead of offering an endless scroll. youtube lets you schedule reminders to take a break. we also have os-level features like apple’s screen time and google’s digital wellbeing for more comprehensive control and monitoring. specifically, digital wellbeing allows you to track your device addiction in several ways, including how often you check your phone, how many notifications you receive, how often you use apps and more, and allows you to set limits on usage, and configure settings like a nightly “wind down” mode and do not disturb settings. announced at google i/o 2018, this feature set first debuted on pixel devices last year as part of android pie. it later came to android one devices last fall. according to the standalone digital wellbeing app’s release notes, it exited beta on february 19. however, the note didn’t indicate it was coming to non-pixel, non-android one devices. google has not yet responded to a request for comment about the expansion of digital wellbeing."
"u.s. smart speaker owners grew 40 percent over 2018 to now reach 66.4 million — or 26.2 percent of the u.s. adult population — according to a new report from voicebot.ai and voicify released this week, which detailed adoption patterns and device market share. the report also reconfirmed amazon echo’s lead, noting the alexa-powered smart speaker grew to a 61 percent market share by the end of last year — well above google home’s 24 percent share. these findings fall roughly in line with other analysts’ reports on smart speaker market share in the u.s. however, because of varying methodology, they don’t all come back with the exact same numbers. for example, in december 2018, emarketer reported the echo had accounted for nearly 67 percent of all u.s. smart speaker sales in 2018. meanwhile, cirp last month put echo further ahead, with a 70 percent share of the installed base in the u.s. though the percentages differ, the overall trend is that amazon echo remains the smart speaker to beat. while on the face of things this appears to be great news for amazon, voicebot’s report did note that google home has been closing the gap with echo in recent months. amazon echo’s share dropped nearly 11 percent over 2018, while google home made up for just over half that decline with a 5.5 percent gain, and “other” devices making up the rest. this latter category, which includes devices like apple’s homepod and sonos one, grew last year to now account for 15 percent of the market. that said, the sonos one has alexa built-in, so it may not be as bad for amazon as the numbers alone seem to indicate. after all, amazon is selling its echo devices at cost or even a loss to snag more market share. the real value over time will be in controlling the ecosystem. the growth in smart speakers is part of a larger trend toward voice computing and smart voice assistants — like siri, bixby and google assistant — which are often accessed on smartphones. a related report from juniper research last month estimated there will be 8 billion digital voice assistants in use by 2023, up from the 2.5 billion in use at the end of 2018. this is due to the increased use of smartphone assistants as well as the smart speaker trend, the firm said. voicebot’s report also saw how being able to access voice assistance on multiple platforms was helping to boost usage numbers. it found that smart speaker owners used their smartphone’s voice assistant more than those who didn’t have a smart speaker in their home. it seems consumers get used to being able to access their voice assistants across platforms — now that siri has made the jump to speakers and alexa to phones, for instance. the full report is available on voicebot.ai’s website here."
"apple is looking to get over its sales woes in china by offering prospective customers interest-free financing with a little help from alibaba. apple’s china website now offers financing packages for iphones that include zero percent interest packages provided in association with several banks and huabei, a consumer credit company operated by alibaba’s ant financial unit, as first noted by reuters. the reuters report further explains the packages on offer: on its china website, apple is promoting the new scheme, under which customers can pay 271 yuan ($40.31) each month to purchase an iphone xr, and 362 yuan each month for an iphone xs. customers trading in old models can get cheaper installments. users buying products worth a minimum of 4,000 yuan worth from apple would qualify for interest-free financing that can be paid over three, six, nine, 12 or 24 months, the website shows. apple is also offering discounts for customers who trade in devices from the likes of huawei, xiaomi and others. the deals are an interesting development that comes just weeks after apple cut revenue guidance for its upcoming q1 earnings. the firm trimmed its revenue from the $89 billion-$93 billion range to $84 billion on account of unexpected “economic deceleration, particularly in greater china.” offering attractive packages may convince some consumers to buy an iphone, but there’s a lingering sense that apple’s current design isn’t sparking interest from chinese consumers. traditionally, it has seen a sales uptick around the launch of iphones that offer a fresh design, and the current iphone xr, xs and xs max line-up bears a strong resemblance to the one-year-old iphone x. the first quarter of a new product launch results in a sales spike in china, but q2 sales — the quarter after the launch — are where devices can underwhelm. it’ll be interesting to see if apple offers similar financing in india, where it saw sales drop by 40 percent in 2018 according to the wall street journal. apple’s market share, which has never been significant, is said to have halved from two percent to one percent over the year. finance is a huge issue for consumers in india, where aggressively priced but capable phones from chinese companies like xiaomi or oneplus dominate the market in terms of sales volume. with the iphone costing multiples more than top android phones, flexible financing could help unlock more sales in india. china, however, has long been a key revenue market for apple, so it figures that this strategy is happening there first."
"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. this week was a treat. we had techcrunch’s own connie loizos in the studio along with your humble servant and general catalyst’s niko bonatsos. a fine group for a busy week. we had to pare our topic list some for length, but after working out what qualified as the biggest news from our usual orbit, we decided to touch on: peloton’s bank shopping: peloton, the popular in-home cycling service, is looking for banks to help take it public. we riffed on its revenue, revenue growth, its possible margins and price points. peloton has become a big name in recent quarters due to its growth, and its marketing. we’re excited to read the eventual s-1. check here for historical context regarding its debut. postmate’s private ipo filing: postmates actually filed, albeit privately, putting it a smidge further along the public-offering conveyor belt. the postmates ipo will help the market better understand the food delivery marketplace, an area where a host of companies play. including the company in our next topic! doordash’s latest round: yes, more money for food delivery. doordash is said to be on the hunt for $500 million more at a valuation around $6 billion. that’s many dollars at a very high price. oh, and don’t forget this. nuro’s enormous check: have you heard of nuro? no? neither had we. but it just raised over $900 million in a single go. even for 2019, the delivery-robot-car company’s fundraising is aggressive. and the latest in saas: quickly, the private saas market looks hot, and the public saas market is scorching. it’s a good time for saas. which is odd, as it seemed that the world ended in december. all that and we had some fun. thanks as always for listening to equity; it’s a treat to make for you each week. stay cool! equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."
"amazon this morning announced a new initiative focused on reducing counterfeiting on its site called project zero — a name that references amazon’s lofty goal of driving counterfeit sales to zero. the program will take advantage of amazon’s technology, including machine learning capabilities, combined with brands’ own knowledge of their intellectual property, in order to automatically and continuously scan amazon’s store to identify and proactively remove violations, among other things. brands that want to utilize the new tools will provide amazon with their logos, trademarks and other key data about their brand. amazon will then scan its 5 billion product listing updates per day, looking for any suspected counterfeits, it says. the idea here is to put more technology behind the search for counterfeits, in order to become more proactive instead of reactive. in the past, brands would need to file a counterfeit report with amazon in order to take action. the new tools allow brands to directly remove and control listings from amazon’s store without having to first contact amazon. another optional service involved with the larger project zero program is product serialization. this service will allow amazon to scan to confirm the authenticity of every one of a brand’s products purchased on the site. it provides a unique code for each manufactured unit, which are put on products during the manufacturing process. when the product is later ordered, amazon scans this code to verify the purchase is authentic. if it’s not, amazon can detect and stop a counterfeit item before it reaches the customer. while project zero enrollment itself is free, brands that use the product serialization service will incur a cost between $0.01 and $0.05 per unit, based on volume, amazon notes. counterfeiting has become a serious problem on amazon, largely due to the size and scale of amazon’s third-party marketplace, which it does little to regulate. some of these items are never even touched by amazon, but are sold and shipped by the third-party seller themselves. others are only fulfilled by amazon, but that doesn’t include a verification process. however, those will bear a “fulfilled by amazon” label, which some consumers misunderstand to mean they’re trustworthy because amazon is somehow involved. according to a study by advocacy group the counterfeit report last year, there have been around 58,000 counterfeit products on amazon since may 2016, engadget reported. but the total number of fakes is much higher, because tcr only accounted for the brands it represents. amazon has been repeatedly called out by brands for effectively being “complicit” with the counterfeiting business, always dusting aside issues because they involved third-party sellers, not amazon’s own store. this has also allowed amazon to escape many legal issues around counterfeiting, though it continues to face lawsuits. for instance, daimler ag sued amazon in 2016 for profiting from sales of wheels that violated its patents. that same year, a family sued amazon when a counterfeit hoverboard burned down their house. apple also sued mobile star llc for making counterfeit apple chargers, which it tried to pass off as authentic on amazon, which brought the retailer’s name to the news. more recently, amazon has inserted itself into the legal battles. last year, it filed three lawsuits in partnership with fashion designer vera bradley and mobile accessories maker otterbox over counterfeits. counterfeiting is not only detrimental to consumers and the brands being copied, it impacts amazon’s business directly — particularly in the increasingly important fashion category. many fashion brands won’t work with amazon. birkenstock, for example, decided to stop doing business with amazon. lvmh (celine, dior, givenchy, louis vuitton and others) said last year that the business of amazon “does not fit” with its brands, and swatch backed out of a deal to sell on amazon in 2017 when the retailer refused to implement proactive protections against counterfeiters. despite all these issues, recent pressure from the u.s. government may have been what helped turn the tide here — forcing amazon and others in the industry to take counterfeiting more seriously. last year, federal investigators purchased counterfeit products off the biggest and most well-known e-commerce sites, including amazon, walmart, ebay, newegg and sears marketplace. of 47 products, 20 were counterfeit — including urban decay cosmetics, yeti mugs, nike air jordan shoes, phone chargers and more. the e-commerce companies, naturally, expressed righteous condemnation of counterfeiting and pledged to work with policy makers on resolutions. amazon says its new project zero tools have been in testing with several brands before today’s launch, including the above-mentioned vera bradley; pet anxiety products manufacturer thunderworks; mobile accessories maker kenu; and lint remover manufacturer chom chom roller. during the testing period, amazon claims it was able to proactively stop 100 times more suspected counterfeit products, compared to what it reactively removes based on brands’ reports. “project zero, with its automated protections and the self-service removal of counterfeit products, is a significant development that will help ensure our customers receive authentic vera bradley products from amazon,” said mark dely, chief legal and administrator officer at vera bradley. “amazon’s product serialization service has been a game-changer for us. we are excited to have this self-service counterfeit removal tool for the u.s. marketplace and consider this to be an insurance policy,” said ken minn, ceo, kenu. project zero is placing a lot of trust in the brands submitting the claims, so amazon warns it will monitor usage for accuracy of their reports. “we are providing brands with an unprecedented level of responsibility, and we are willing to do so because we believe that the combined strengths of amazon and brands can drive counterfeits to zero,” the company writes on the project zero website faq. “brands must maintain a high bar for accuracy in order to maintain their project zero privileges. we have a number of processes in place to promote accuracy, including required training as part of project zero enrollment and ongoing monitoring to prevent misuse of our tools.”  project zero is launching first as an invite-only product in the u.s.; brands can sign up to join before rolling out more broadly. participants must have a government-registered trademark and be enrolled in the amazon brand registry to qualify."
"“bandersnatch” offers an unusual television experience — but not a very satisfying one. the new “black mirror” special follows stefan butler as he attempts to turn a science fiction novel (also called “bandersnatch”) into a choose your own adventure-style video game. as the story progresses, stefan gets pulled deeper into the mystery of what happened to “bandersnatch” author jerome f. davies, a mystery that eventually involves parallel universes, government conspiracies and stefan’s own family tragedy. netflix has experimented with interactive content before, though previously aimed at kids — for example with an adaptation of “minecraft: story mode” from telltale games. the format, where the viewer is periodically given a limited time to choose stefan’s next action, should also feel familiar to players of telltale titles like “the walking dead” and “batman: the telltale series.” the big difference, however, is that most other games want you to feel that your choices are meaningful. “bandersnatch” flips the formula on its head, ripping away the illusion of free will and consequence and instead exploring a scenario where your choices can often feel reversible or otherwise meaningless. on the latest episode of the original content podcast, we’re joined by kirsten korosec to review the show. our reactions ranged from outright hatred to tentative admiration for the creators’ ambition — but even when we found “bandersnatch” to be at least conceptually interesting, the experience itself became tiresome by the end. we also review “bird box,” the new netflix thriller starring sandra bullock as a woman navigating a world overrun by monsters who cannot be seen — because if you see them, you’ll immediately kill yourself. according to netflix, “bird box” set a record among the streaming service’s original films for most viewers in its first week. you can listen in the player below, subscribe using apple podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice. if you like the show, please let us know by leaving a review on apple. you also can send us feedback directly.

"ahead of spotify’s entry into the indian market, the streaming service this morning announced a global content deal with a leading indian film and music company, t-series, which gives it access to t-series’ entire indian song catalog. this includes bollywood and regional movie soundtracks, plus other non-film albums and emerging artist content, the company says. in total the catalog boasts more than 160,000 songs, and is available to spotify listeners as of today. the deal has been rumored to be in the works for some time, as spotify has been negotiating with top indian labels like t-series as well as times music, eros music and zee music to expand its catalog of local content before a launch in india. in november, t-series managing director bhushan kumar confirmed a deal with spotify was in its final stages. “we are bullish about india’s most popular music company tying up with the world’s most popular music streaming service,” kumar said today, in a statement. “we are confident that together we will be able to reach new markets and spread the love for indian music far and wide.” deals with labels aren’t the only way spotify is prepping for its indian debut. this past summer, it launched an indian music hub on its service called desi, which now counts more than 930,000 followers and includes its own playlist, desi hits. the indian market won’t be simple for spotify to win, as it will go up against local players, including gaana, which has more than 80 million users, in addition to saavn, wynk and global music services provided by apple, amazon and google. but gaining a foothold is key to spotify’s continued international growth, due to the market’s sheer size. spotify has grown to more than 200 million monthly users worldwide ahead of its launch in india, but is not profitable. (except for that brief moment it had, thanks to a tax benefit.) despite not yet operating in india, spotify says more than 4 million users are now regularly listening to indian music on the service. there also are an estimated 30 million indians living overseas, including in markets where spotify operates, like the u.s., mexico, brazil, the u.k, and germany, says spotify. the company is expected to launch in india in the first half of 2019, and that time frame hasn’t changed, we understand. “one of the ways spotify has helped revolutionise music discovery is through its ability to connect millions of fans with the best music and artists from all over the world in a way that just wasn’t possible before streaming,” said paul smith, director, head of international licensing at spotify, in a statement. “today’s deal with t-series significantly strengthens our indian music catalogue, bringing bollywood to more than 200 million spotify users worldwide. having t-series on spotify is hugely significant and shows our commitment towards providing the very best music for our users,” he added."
"apple music is launching on amazon fire tv in the u.s. today, after rolling out in december to amazon’s echo line of smart speakers. the news is notable as it’s yet another example of the eased tensions between the two rivals following apple ceo tim cook’s 2017 announcement of apple’s agreement with amazon. their deal allowed amazon’s prime video app to launch on apple tv and saw the return of apple products on amazon.com. since then, the companies have made several moves to honor their deal. last year, for example, amazon expanded its assortment of apple inventory to include other devices besides apple tv — like ipads, iphones, apple watch and beats headphones. it also brought its freetime unlimited app to ios. and most recently, apple music arrived on echo. now it’s coming to amazon fire tv, too. the launch will allow apple music subscribers the ability to access the streaming service’s catalog of 50 million songs just by asking alexa. users can request songs, artists, playlists and albums by saying things like “alexa, play today’s hits on apple music,” or “alexa, play music by [artist’s name] on apple music,” for example. on fire tv cube, apple music can also be streamed within multi-room music groups. to use apple music on fire tv, you’ll have to enable the apple music skill and link your account. (those who had already done so in order to listen on their echo device won’t need to do this again.) amazon isn’t the only company benefiting from apple’s decision to shift more of its company’s focus to subscription services — like its streaming music offering and, soon, its streaming video service. apple also recently announced a partnership with samsung to bring itunes content to samsung smart tvs through a dedicated app and related deals with tv makers like vizio and lg to support airplay. it’s said to be working on a similar deal to get airplay supported on roku. apple music is available to u.s. fire tv owners starting today. amazon says apple music support will roll out to both fire tv and echo users in the u.k. in the weeks ahead."
"security researchers say they’ve found more than a dozen iphone apps covertly communicating with a server associated with golduck, a historically android-focused malware that infects popular classic game apps. the malware has been known about for over a year, after it was first discovered by appthority infecting classic and retro games on google play, by embedding backdoor code that allowed malicious payloads to be silently pushed to the device. at the time, more than 10 million users were affected by the malware, allowing hackers to run malicious commands at the highest privileges, like sending premium sms messages from a victim’s phone to make money. now, the researchers say iphone apps linked to the malware could also present a risk. wandera, an enterprise security firm, said it found 14 apps — all retro-style games — that were communicating with the same command and control server used by the golduck malware. “the [golduck] domain was on a watchlist we established due to its use in distributing a specific strain of android malware in the past,” said michael covington, wandera’s vice-president of product. “when we started seeing communication between ios devices and the known malware domain, we investigated further.” the apps include: commando metal: classic contra, super pentron adventure: super hard, classic tank vs super bomber, super adventure of maritron, roy adventure troll game, trap dungeons: super adventure, bounce classic legend, block game, classic bomber: super legend, brain it on: stickman physics, bomber game: classic bomberman, classic brick – retro block, the climber brick, and chicken shoot galaxy invaders. according to the researchers, what they saw so far seems relatively benign — the command and control server simply pushes a list of icons in a pocket of ad space in the upper-right corner of the app. when the user opens the game, the server tells the app which icons and links it should serve to the user. they did, however, see the apps sending ip address data — and, in some cases, location data — back to the golduck command and control server. techcrunch verified their claims, running the apps on a clean iphone through a proxy, allowing us to see where the data goes. based on what we saw, the app tells the malicious golduck server what app, version, device type, and the ip address of the device — including how many ads were displayed on the phone. as of now, the researchers say that the apps are packed with ads — likely as a way to make a quick buck. but they expressed concern that the communication between the app and the known-to-be-malicious server could open up the app — and the device — to malicious commands down the line. “the apps themselves are technically not compromised; while they do not contain any malicious code, the backdoor they open presents a risk for exposure that our customers do not want to take. “a hacker could easily use the secondary advertisement space to display a link that redirects the user and dupes them into installing a provisioning profile or a new certificate that ultimately allows for a more malicious app to be installed,” said the researchers. that could be said for any game or app, regardless of device maker or software. but the connection to a known malicious server isn’t a good look. covington said that the company has “observed malicious content being shared from the server,” but that it wasn’t related to the games. the implication is that if the server is sending malicious payloads to android users, iphone users could be next. techcrunch sent the list of apps to data insights firm sensor tower, which estimated that the 14 apps had been installed close to one million times since they were released — excluding repeated downloads or installs across different devices. when we tried contacting the app makers, many of the app store links pointed to dead links or to pages with boilerplate privacy policies but no contact information. the registrant on the golduck domain appears to be fake, along with other domains associated with golduck, which often have different names and email addresses. apple did not comment when reached prior to publication. the apps are appear to still be downloadable from the app store, but all now say they are “not currently available in the u.s. store.” apple’s app stores may have a better rap than google’s, which every once in a while lets malicious apps slip through the net. in reality, neither store is perfect. earlier this year, security researchers found a top-tier app in the mac app store that was collecting users’ browsing history without permission, and dozens of iphone apps that were sending user location data to advertisers without explicitly asking first. for the average user, malicious apps remain the largest and most common threat to mobile users — even with locked down device software and the extensive vetting of apps. if there’s one lesson, now and always: don’t download what you don’t need, or can’t trust. cybersecurity 101: five simple security guides for protecting your privacy"
"your cable nightmare might soon be over. the usb implementers forum (usb-if) has unveiled the specifications of usb 4.0, as engadget reports. and usb 4.0 looks a lot like thunderbolt 3. while specifications won’t be finalized until later this year, usb 4 should support speeds of 40 gbps. the usb-if is using thunderbolt 3 as the foundation for usb 4. intel originally developed the thunderbolt interface with apple back in 2011. it was supposed to be a faster and more versatile interface that supports multiple protocols. for instance, you can use thunderbolt cables and devices to connect displays and hard drives. you can daisy-chain your peripherals, which can be useful for external graphics cards, for instance. with thunderbolt 3, intel added usb 3.1 gen 2 support, which means that you can plug a usb device to a thunderbolt port. and intel adopted the usb-c port. in other words, thunderbolt ports became usb ports with thunderbolt capabilities on top. it means that any usb device can be used with a thunderbolt port. if you’re using a macbook pro, you’ve probably taken advantage of that feature. but usb devices plugged into thunderbolt ports don’t magically become thunderbolt devices. if you plug an external usb 3.0 hard drive in a thunderbolt port, you’re limited to usb 3.0 speeds. even though thunderbolt is technically superior, it hasn’t been as popular as usb devices. device manufacturers had to pay royalty fees to intel (correction: thunderbolt 3 has always been royalty-free, but specifications weren’t public). making a thunderbolt device is also more expensive in general. a couple of years ago, intel announced that it would make thunderbolt available to everyone without any royalty fee. so the usb-if is taking advantage of that by integrating thunderbolt 3 specifications into usb 4. usb 4.0 will support charging speeds of 100w of power, transfer speeds of 40 gbps and enough video bandwidth for two 4k displays or one 5k display. usb 4 should also be backward-compatible with usb 3.x, 2.x and 1.x devices. if you have a usb 3.x cable with type-c connectors, you may have to upgrade to usb 4 cables. but thunderbolt 3 should work fine, as they’re essentially the same thing as usb 4 cables. i hope there will be a way to distinguish usb 3.x ports from usb 4 ports though. intel won’t drop the thunderbolt name altogether. thunderbolt devices are certified by intel, while you don’t need any certification to release a usb device. usb 4 sounds like a great way to start from a clean slate. one port and one cable type to rule them all. but let’s hope manufacturers follow the official specifications and don’t try to cut corners."
"twitter today is joining the podcasting arena. this morning, the social network is launching its first-ever podcast series with a new show focused on twitter’s advertising business, which it’s calling “character count.” the company says, for now, it’s testing the waters with five already produced episodes of around 25 to 30 minutes in length. it plans to wait to record more shows after getting the crowd’s reaction to the first few episodes, so it can make adjustments if need be. the podcast will be hosted by joe wadlington, a marketer at twitter who’s specifically supporting twitter’s business initiatives. each episode will involve talking to people behind the scenes of some of twitter’s advertising stories, including the monterey bay aquarium (@montereyaq), dropbox (@dropbox) and simon & schuster (@simonbooks). the companies will speak about how they built effective ad campaigns and why twitter’s audience mattered to them. the goal, says twitter, is to offer others in the industry a look into which brands are “doing it right on twitter,” and potentially spark more brands to do the same. the launch of the podcast arrives when twitter is trying to shift wall street’s attention away from the network’s stagnant user growth. twitter recently said it would stop reporting monthly users, in favor of daily users, as a result of its inability to grow this key number. the change was announced in twitter’s q4 2018 earnings release, where the company said it had lost another 5 million monthly users in the final quarter of 2018, bringing its total down to 321 million. instead, twitter wants more attention on its ability to turn a profit from the users it does have — as it did in q4 for the fifth quarter in a row, and the fifth time ever. its q4 revenues were $909 million, which were more than the expected $868.1 million and up 24 percent on the year ago quarter. advertising accounted for 87 percent of those revenues, twitter said. it’s no surprise, then, that twitter now wants to help advertisers learn from others succeeding in this space and grow that figure further. twitter is not the only company that’s tapping into the popular audio format of podcasting to talk to advertisers and marketers more directly. in january, facebook also launched its first u.s. podcast with a series focused on entrepreneurship — the larger, unspoken goal being to position facebook as a place where entrepreneurs come to advertise their business. and somewhat related, linkedin debuted linkedin live, a new video broadcast service that gives people and organizations the ability to stream real-time videos to groups in a sort of cross between youtube live and video podcasting, perhaps. twitter, like facebook and linkedin, will not be running other ads within its programming. that makes sense, as the podcast itself is effectively an ad for twitter’s business and advertising tools. new episodes will debut every two weeks on apple podcasts, google podcasts, spotify, tunein and stitcher."
"apple sues qualcomm, qualcomm sues apple, qualcomm sues apple, qualcomm sues apple. for the past two years, the legal battle between apple and qualcomm has played out much like this, while the patent cases have greatly inconvenienced apple at times in certain markets, the royalties suit that apple filed in january of 2017 has threatened a big part of qualcomm’s core business and ultimately led apple to start eschewing qualcomm ip in their devices. the entire saga is about to reach a fever pitch, we are just weeks away from proceedings kicking off for apple’s $1 billion royalties suit. today, a more low-key eight-day trial kicked off in san diego federal court regarding apple’s alleged usage of patent-infringing modem tech. the case, overseen by u.s. district judge dana sabraw, is related to the power consumption and speed of boot-up times for iphones sold in the period between mid-2017 and late-2018. a positive outcome for qualcomm could result in up to $1.41 in damages per infringing iphone sold during this period, an amount that could swell to tens of millions in damages, reuters reports. qualcomm has scored some small victories in its efforts to chip away at apple. the company has won iphone sales bans in germany and china for certain models, though the ban in china has yet to be enforced and apple has modified some of its phones in germany to comply with the ruling."
"last year, spotify took a stake in music distribution service distrokid. apple acquired platoon. and today, soundcloud announced it’s adding its own music distribution tools to its premium accounts aimed at artists, soundcloud pro and soundcloud pro unlimited. with soundcloud premier distribution, artists can upload their tracks to all major music services, including amazon music, apple music, spotify, tencent, youtube music and even instagram, directly from soundcloud. the service, which is now launching into beta, is available at no extra cost to existing premium account holders. the company notes this is the first distribution tool built directly into a streaming platform, but that’s not likely to remain the case for long. when spotify invested in distrokid in october 2018, it said that it would soon roll out a tool that would allow musicians to upload their tracks to the service through the spotify for artists platform. and apple’s acquisition of platoon seems to indicate the company wants to go in a similar direction in terms of offering more tools and services to artists. however, soundcloud touts the benefits of its own premier distribution service as a means of centralizing artist payouts, from all music services — itself included. via soundcloud premier, artists can monetize their music through a revenue-sharing program. with the distribution service, artists can now publish their tracks more broadly — and soundcloud says it doesn’t take a cut of the payouts from the other services. in addition, the company highlights the tool’s feature set, noting how it allows artists to make changes and correct mistakes on the fly, rather than having to go through customer service as on some other distribution services. it even offers to help artists currently using alternatives like distrokid or tunecore to switch over, so they don’t lose their stats. the new distribution tool is rolling out to eligible pro ($6/mo) and pro unlimited ($12/mo) subscribers who are 18 years of age or older, creators of original music and have zero copyright strikes and at least 1,000 monetizable track plays, the company says. creators will be notified by email and in-product notifications when the tool becomes available to them. soundcloud had once aimed to compete on the same playing field as streaming music giants like apple music and spotify, but may be waking up to the fact that it can offer more value by investing in tools that artists need. it wouldn’t be the first company to make this sort of shift either. in the video space, vimeo once aimed to compete with youtube, before changing its focus entirely to become a hub for tools for video creators. that pivot has paid off for vimeo — this month, parent company iac noted vimeo saw a 28 percent increase in revenue during the past quarter. soundcloud, however, has progressed slowly, including on monetization and other changes — allowing competitors to catch up or surpass its own offerings. that could be the case with music distribution, too, as spotify’s soon-to-launch tools could outdo soundcloud’s in the near future."
"augmented reality looked like it was supposed to a ubiquitous success; apple and google and facebook seemed to say so. but things are taking a bit of time to get kicked off, so the startups in the space are having to get real weird with it. adventurous is an augmented reality scavenger hunt geared toward families, but it drags in enough elements of the real world to make it a pretty robust experience. this isn’t your typical ar phone app that you pop open once. for one thing, you have to be at a certain physical location in order to try it out, you have to make an appointment and, oh yeah, there are live actors involved. this may be one of the more odd companies in y combinator’s latest startup batch — it’s basically a kind of tech-enabled live theater. the company’s co-founders acknowledge that having appointments and live actors involved with an app isn’t the most scalable business model in internet history, but they say they’ll figure stuff out as they move along, and that for now the families and kids involved really like the experience. “we know that families are constantly looking for stuff to do with their kids, and not all screen time is good screen time,” adventurous co-founder jeany ngo tells techcrunch. adventurous co-founders jeany ngo and brian schulman when a family or group books an adventure, they meet at a designated location at a given time and get a rundown on the mission and story from actors in full dress and character, then they’re tasked with walking around to different physical locations where different geo-tagged experiences will pop up on their arkit or arcore-enabled phone and they’ll have to complete the tasks to move on. the experiences are designed to be around 45 minutes to 1 hour each and the whole shebang costs $15 per person. one of the big selling points of augmented reality as a medium is that it can theoretically gain an understanding of a location’s geometry and plunk down digital content in a way that’s tailored to your space. that may be true for something like google’s ar stickers, where it’s a little stationary 3d model, but when you start talking about actual story lines, the fact is that computer vision just can’t make reliable sense of a dynamic environment when it comes to a game or experience. suns out foxes out! enjoy the sunny day and help the foxes bring peace to the neighborhood with our latest adventure! download the app at https://t.co/frtxrnkmfa! pic.twitter.com/inbgtvtknd — adventurous co (@adventurousco) february 18, 2019 the company has been testing various locations for their ar adventures; right now they’re sticking with missions in san francisco’s chinatown and golden gate park. it’s a little unclear whether there could be any associated legal issues for a startup tying digital experiences to physical public locations, but the co-founders say they haven’t run in to any issues yet. with adventurous, the startup is banking on the robustness of an ironed-out experience to suck in fans and bring them back. the company’s co-founders foresee a world where narratives fit together like episodes in a tv series, bringing families back to book appointments to see what happens next. location-based entertainment has been a hit-or-miss vertical for the vr industry, though some startups have seen success. sandbox vr finished out a $68 million series b earlier this year in a round led by a16z. for ar startups, there haven’t been too many stories of entertainment experiences that have been strictly tied to geographic areas outside of event activations. while you can find pokéstops inside pokémon go, it isn’t a full linear experience that requires everyone to move along an identical path. adventurous is live now. if you’re in sf, you can book yourself a fancy scavenger hunt in augmented reality this weekend."
"thailand’s government passed a controversial cybersecurity bill today that has been criticized for vagueness and the potential to enable sweeping access to internet user data. the bill (available in thai) was amended late last year following criticism over potential data access, but it passed the country’s parliament with 133 positives votes and no rejections, although there were 16 absentees. there are concerns around a number of clauses, chiefly the potential for the government — which came to power via a military coup in 2014 — to search and seize data and equipment in cases that are deemed issues of national emergency. that could enable internet traffic monitoring and access to private data, including communications, without a court order. the balance of power beyond enforcement has also been questioned. critics have highlighted the role of the national cybersecurity committee, which is headed by the prime minister and holds considerable weight in carrying out the law. the committee has been called upon to include representation from the industry and civic groups to give it greater oversight and balance. added together, there’s a fear that the law could be weaponized by the government to silence critics. thailand already has powerful lese majeste laws, which make it illegal to criticize the monarchy and have been used to jail citizens for comments left on social media and websites. the country has also censored websites in the past, including the daily mail and, for a nearly six-month period in 2007, youtube. “the asia internet coalition is deeply disappointed that thailand’s national assembly has voted in favor of a cybersecurity law that overemphasizes a loosely-defined national security agenda, instead of its intended objective of guarding against cyber risks,” read a statement from jeff paine, managing director of asia internet coalition — an alliance of international tech firms that include facebook, google and apple. “protecting online security is a top priority; however, the law’s ambiguously defined scope, vague language and lack of safeguards raises serious privacy concerns for both individuals and businesses, especially provisions that allow overreaching authority to search and seize data and electronic equipment without proper legal oversight. this would give the regime sweeping powers to monitor online traffic in the name of an emergency or as a preventive measure, potentially compromising private and corporate data,” paine added. reaction to the law has seen a hashtag (#พรบไซเบอร์) trend on twitter in thailand, while other groups have spoken out on the potential implications. thailand isn’t alone in introducing controversial internet laws. new regulations, passed last summer, came into force in near-neighbor vietnam on january 1 and sparked similar concerns around free speech online. that vietnamese law broadly forbids internet users from organizing with, or training, others for anti-state purposes, spreading false information and undermining the nation-state’s achievements or solidarity. it also requires foreign internet companies to operate a local office and store user information on vietnamese soil. that’s something neither google nor facebook has complied with, despite the vietnamese government’s recent claim that the former is investigating a local office launch."
"a veteran tv maker just got a notable refresh as it enters the age of connected devices. xiaomi, the beijing-based firm best known for budget smartphones, has bought 65.2 million shares, or 0.48 percent, of chinese home appliance maker tcl, said tcl in a statement to the shenzhen stock exchange on sunday. shares of tcl, the world’s third-largest lcd tv manufacturer, jumped nearly 4 percent in morning trading on monday, giving the company a market cap of $36 billion. the financial gesture deepens an existing alliance between the duo. on december 29, the companies signed a strategic partnership that would see them collaborate on various fronts, including r&d in integrating smart devices with “core, high-end, and basic” electronic parts. to put in layman’s terms, the joint effort focuses on chips and will make it easier for tcl devices to incorporate into xiaomi’s operating system, where an expanding universe of third-party gadgets reside. the partners may also make co-investments in the hardware field. the tie-up provides “tremendous help” for xiaomi as it ups the ante in home appliances, wrote xiaomi founder and ceo lei jun on weibo, china’s closest answer to twitter, in a reply to tcl’s ceo li dongsheng. during the third quarter of 2018, smart tvs helped drive revenue growth for xiaomi’s non-smartphone hardware segment, shows the company’s financial results. “[our partnership] helps facilitate the transformation and upgrade of china’s manufacturing industry,” wrote li, whose company started in 1981 as a cassette manufacturer. xiaomi has long been keen to team up with manufacturers to make its own branded devices instead of producing them itself. by early 2018, xiaomi reached nearly 100 such partners, many of which xiaomi had invested in to harness bargaining power in the supply chain, from what a smartphone should look like to how much it’s priced at. xiaomi’s retail stores — available online and in physical manifestations — have also opened doors to third-party brands in an effort to broaden product selection. xiaomi’s close ties with its ecosystem partners result in an inventory of affordable products rivaling the likes of fitbit and apple. during the third quarter of 2018, xiaomi topped the global chart by shipping 6.9 million units of wearables. apple and fitbit came in second and third with 4.2 million units and 3.5 million units, respectively, according to market research firm idc. xiaomi derives most of its revenues from smartphones, though lei jun has long envisioned a future in which internet services will be the firm’s main force. this segment, which xiaomi has marketed as its key financial differentiator against other phone brands, includes sales from mobile games, internet finance, paid content among a slew of services available through xiaomi’s connected devices."
"let’s face it, we love large numbers. we are obsessed with them, whether it’s forbes list of wealthiest individuals or tech unicorns, if it’s a big number we can’t get enough. such is the case with the somehow magical trillion-dollar mark that apple briefly reached last summer. we splashed the headlines and glorified it as though it mattered… but it didn’t. it was just a number. sure it showed the tremendous value of the apple stock, but it was a moment in time fueled by an overheated stock market, full of sound and fury, but in the end adding up to nothing. fast forward 4 months and the company has lost more than a third of its stock value. last week, it lost $75 billion with a b in market cap in a single day. we got a hard lesson in stock market physics — what goes up eventually must come down. hard lessons in that light, the trillion-dollar mark was fun, but it didn’t mean much in the end. ultimately, apple stock still has value. it may make a few less billion next quarter than it predicted, but it’s still got plenty of cash on the books, and chances are it will be just fine in the end. apple lowers guidance on q1 results, cites china trade tensions as long as the us-china trade war rages on and the us economy continues to cool, it’s probably not going to approach that trillion threshold again any time soon. investor enthusiasm for tech stocks in general has waned considerably since those heady dog days of august. just as bill gates or warren buffet or jeff bezos may have a few billion more or less on the books on any given day, it just doesn’t matter all that much. it’s not as though they’re going broke. just as apple isn’t going to shut down because it might have a bad (less good) quarter than it was projected to have. nobody grows forever, not even apple. it had to cool off at some point, and if this is cooling off, 87 billion instead of 91 billion, it’s a drop-off that investors should be able to understand and live with. if it became a troubling pattern and an ice age set in, that would be another matter, but apple is still selling product hand over fist, tens of millions of iphones is still a lot of iphones. wall street should probably take a chill pill. tech stock doldrums it’s worth noting that apple has hardly been in alone taking a huge hit on its stock price, especially tech stocks, which have been taking a beating since november on wall street. want to talk a trillion dollars, how about the biggest names in tech losing a trillion (that’s with a t, folks) in value in one stretch in november. when apple halted trading last week to announce lower than expected revenue, the stock dove even further, as it confirmed the worst fears of investors. worse, chinese consumers have driven iphone sales just as the chinese economy has hit a massive speed bump this year. in june, reuters reported shockingly weak growth. in november, bloomberg reported that the chinese economy was slowing down long before the president started a trade war. . apple also appears to be having more trouble selling the xr worldwide than it had projected, and fluctuating currency rates are also wreaking havoc — not to mention the trade war — but analyst horace dediu from asymco sees apple generating strong revenue from non-iphone hardware, as the chart he shared on twitter recently shows: how does apple’s business look if you exclude the iphone? pic.twitter.com/bk5xgcq2or — horace dediu (@asymco) january 6, 2019 whatever the future holds for apple and other tech stocks, we clearly like to throw around large numbers. yet companies don’t tend to live and die by their market cap. it’s not a metric that matters all that much to anyone, except those of us who like to marvel at the size of the biggest numbers, and then click our tongues when they inevitably fall to earth."
"in a new a16z podcast with the venture firm’s founders marc andreessen and ben horowitz, there’s a lot to enjoy, from andreessen’s tv show recommendations to horowitz’s secret to excellent barbecue. (it’s pretty much just “time,” as you might imagine.) more useful for our founder readers may be andreessen’s predictions around tech and, because he’s asked about them specifically, his predictions when it comes to wearables, including that virtual reality will be “one thousand” times bigger than augmented reality. it’s an interesting statement given the firm’s bet on magic leap and its ar goggles. you can find the entire podcast here. our favorite parts are excerpted below for your weekend reading: on audio: “the really big one right now is audio. audio is on the rise just generally and particularly with apple and the airpods, which has been an absolute home run [for apple]. it’s one of the most deceptive things because it’s just like this little product, and how important could it be? and i think it’s tremendously important, because it’s basically a voice in your ear any time you want. for example, there are these new youtube type celebrities, and everybody’s kind of wondering where people are finding the spare time to watch these youtube videos and listen to these youtube people in the tens and tens of millions. and the answer is: they’re at work. they have this bluetooth thing in their ear, and they’ve got a hat, and that’s 10 hours on the forklift and that’s 10 hours of joe rogan. that’s a big deal. of course, speech as a [user interface] is rapidly on the rise. so i think audio is going to be titanically important.” on sensors: “the second thing i’d nominate for wearables is the concept of sensors on the body. here, the apple watch is clearly in the lead with what they’re doing with the heartbeat sensor. but i think we’ll have a full complement of medical-grade sensors on our body — in a way that we have chosen to [have them] — over the next five or 10 years. i think we’ll be able to predict things like heart attacks and strokes before they happen. talk about a killer app. [laughs.] ‘beep. i’m going to have a heart attack in four hours. maybe i should drive to the hospital.’ the survival rate [for heart attack victims] at the hospital is, like, 99 percent. the survival rate for people at home is like 50 percent. there’s an opportunity for a massive increase in quality of life with the sensor platforms people are going to have.” on the future of ar/vr: “i think optics are coming. it’s going to be a long road, but i think ar and vr are going to work, and that we’re going to have heads-up displays that are going to remove the need for what we have now, which is this little pane of glass that we’re expected to experience the whole world through. the whole world is going to open up around us. i think ar has tons of potential applications, both at work and at home. [but] i think vr is going to be about 1,000 times bigger. in the valley right now, this is a very contrarian view. the general theme that you hear is that ar will be bigger than vr, and obviously it should be. if you can do things overlaid over the real world, that should be inherently more interesting than having to construct a synthetic world. i just think that’s only true for people who live in a really interesting place in the real world. but only something like .1 percent and 1 percent of people on earth live in a place where they wake up every morning and think, wow, there are so many interesting things to see. so for everyone who doesn’t already live on a college campus or in silicon valley or in a major other city, the new environments we’re going to be able to create in vr will inherently be much more interesting. and there will be a lot more of them.”"
"movable ink has always helped marketers create highly customizable, visually interesting emails. today, the company announced a new capability for marketers who want to introduce lightweight augmented reality (ar) to their campaigns. movable ink co-founder and cto michael nutt says the company was looking for a way to provide customers with ar experiences with less fuss than most current methods. “marketers were looking for something interesting in ar, but they wanted to do it themselves without expensive consultants. we had this powerful visual channel already. we combined that with web technologies and put together an offering for our clients,” he explained. this isn’t highly sophisticated ar, but it does provide a starting point for marketers who want to get involved with it. the idea involves creating branded selfies. say you are using a vacation company to take a cruise. the company could send you an email a couple of days prior to the trip. clicking the email takes you to a site where you can take a picture of yourself, superimposed over a relevant background. users can share these images on social media, thereby acting as brand ambassadors for these companies. photo: movable ink movable ink’s mission involves making marketing emails more interesting so people open them. the ar component is really about increasing engagement, and movable ink says that in early betas, it has been seeing a 40 percent increase in open rates, and 50 percent of participants who do open the email spending more than a minute engaging with the ar experience. the flavor of ar the company is offering doesn’t require the end user to have any special equipment and it doesn’t require the marketers to have coding skills. it’s all designed using tools that work inside any browser with graphical overlays and face filters to provide this customized selfie experience. once marketers create these experiences, they can measure and report on them like any marketing email, looking at opens, engagement time, the number of times the camera has been activated and how many pictures have been taken. the company began working on this capability about a year ago and launched in beta in october. the product is available for movable ink customers starting today. movable ink now lets developers build custom email applets"
"apple’s push to get developers to build subscription-based apps is now having a notable impact on app store revenues. according to a new report from sensor tower due out later this week, revenue generated per u.s. iphone grew 36 percent, from $58 in 2017 to $79 last year. as is typical, much of that increase can be attributed to mobile gaming, which accounted for more than half of this per-device average. however, more substantial growth took place in the categories outside of gaming — including those categories where subscription-based apps tend to rule the top charts, the firm found. according to the report’s findings, per-device app spending in the u.s. grew more over the past year than it did in 2017. from 2017 to 2018, iphone users spent an average of $21 or more on in-app purchases and paid app downloads — a 36 percent increase compared with the 23 percent increase from 2016 to 2017, when revenue per device grew from $47 to $58. however, 2018’s figure was slightly lower than the 42 percent increase in average per-device spending seen between 2015 and 2016, when revenue grew from $33 to $47, noted sensor tower. as usual, mobile gaming continued to play a large role in iphone spending. in 2018, gaming accounted for nearly 56 percent of the average consumer spend — or $44 out of the total $79 spent per iphone. but what’s more interesting is how the non-gaming categories fared this past year. some categories — including those where subscription-based apps dominate the top charts — saw even higher year-over-year growth in 2018, the firm found. for example, entertainment apps grew their spend per device increase by 82 percent to $8 of the total in 2018. lifestyle apps increased by 86 percent to reach $3.90, up from $2.10. and though it didn’t make the top five, health & fitness apps also grew 75 percent year-over-year to account for an average of $2.70, up from $1.60 in 2017. other categories in the top five included music and social networking apps, which both grew by 22 percent. this data indicates that subscription apps are playing a significant role in helping drive iphone consumer spending higher. the news comes at a time when apple has reported slowing iphone sales, which is pushing the company to lean more on services to continue to boost its revenue. this includes not just app store subscriptions, but also things like apple music, apple pay, icloud, app store search ads, applecare and more. as subscriptions become more popular, apple will need to remain vigilant against those who would abuse the system. for example, a number of sneaky subscription apps were found plaguing the app store in recent weeks. they were duping users into paid memberships with tricky buttons, hidden text, instant trials that converted in days and the use of other misleading tactics. apple later cracked down by removing some of the apps, and updated its developer guidelines with stricter rules about how subscriptions should both look and operate. a failure to properly police the app store or set boundaries to prevent the overuse of subscriptions could end up turning users off from downloading new apps altogether — especially if users begin to think that every app is after a long-term financial commitment. developers will need to be clever to convert users and retain subscribers amid this shift away from paid apps to those that come with a monthly bill. app makers will need to properly market their subscription’s benefits, and even consider offering bundles to increase the value. but in the near-term, the big takeaway for developers is that there is still good money to be made on the app store, even if iphone sales are slowing."
"china’s xiaomi has become the latest smartphone maker to tease a folding smartphone, dropping the below video clip of its president and co-founder, bin lin, fondling the device on social media today. the twist is the tablet does not have a single center parting but rather two folds that divide it into three panels, with xiaomi claiming in a tweet: “it is the world’s first ever double folding phone.” the video shows bin contemplating a tablet-sized touchscreen device before quickly turning it on its side, taking it into landscape orientation, where he performs the party trick — folding two panels of screen, one at each side, back behind the tablet to form a slightly chunky looking phablet. excited to share this video of a special xiaomi smartphone from our president and co-founder bin lin . it is the world’s first ever double folding phone — that’s pretty cool, isn’t it? #xiaomi #foldingphone #technology pic.twitter.com/ibj0n3vibw — wang xiang (@xiangw_) january 23, 2019 the video is edited so it cuts from front view to back at the moment of the fold so the actual folding action is not seen from the front. but from the back the two folded wings go dark after being folded. when the video cuts back to the front there’s a slight spinning of the screen, as the software appears to grapple momentarily with the new form factor, before it stablizes in portrait orientation. the phablet form of the device resembles the bezel-less “infinity display” design of a handset like the 2018 samsung galaxy s8 — albeit more squat looking than the tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio of the s8. xiaomi’s tweet teaser does not include any details about how near (or indeed far off) a market launch of the device might be. we’ve reached out to the company with questions about the prototype and any launch plans. update: a spokesman pointed us to a post on bin’s weibo account where he asks his followers for feedback on the prototype, and suggests xiaomi is still weighing up whether to bring the folding phone to market, writing: “if you like it, we will consider making a mass production machine in the future.” he also asks for name suggestions, saying xiaomi is toying with two: xiaomi dual flex or xiaomi mix flex. “this symmetrical double-folded form perfectly combines the experience of the tablet and mobile phone, which is both practical and beautiful,” he writes [translated via google translate], saying building the prototype entailed “conquering a series of technical problems such as flexible folding screen technology, four-wheel drive folding shaft technology, flexible cover technology, and miui adaptation.” “we made the first folding screen mobile phone, which should be the world’s first double folding mobile phone,” he adds, again taking a tentative tone vis-à-vis a potential launch time frame. in recent months a handful of folding smartphone prototypes have been demoed by mobile makers, including a booklet-style folding slab from samsung — trailed as incoming for years but finally teased officially last fall — which also appears to transforms into a rather chunky handset. an invite to a february 20 samsung launch event for the forthcoming galaxy s10, sent out to press two weeks ago, also included a conspicuous centerfold in its graphic teaser. ergo, a commercial launch from samsung looks imminent. while, at ces, a little known chinese oem called royole beat others to the punch by showing off a folder in the flesh. in tablet form the android-powered flexpai, as the device was christened, is 7.8-inches. but once folded in half the gizmo is left with an unsightly gap between the screen pieces, bulking up the resulting smartphone.   xiaomi’s triptych looks to offer a more pleasing design for handling the inevitable air gap created by a folding screen by concealing the ends in the middle of the dual folded panels. side tucks certainly look more visually pleasing. that said, two folds could mean a higher risk of screen problems — if the folding mechanism isn’t robust enough to handle lots of bending back and forth. it’s also far from clear whether consumers will generally take to folding phones, or snub them as fiddly and gimmicky. in recent years smartphone design has converged around a phablet-sized touchscreen and little else. so adding any fresh mechanical complication is a bit of a risk given how smooth and hermetically sealed smartphones have otherwise become. but a clutch of android oems are going to try their luck, regardless. and with a saturated smartphone market, stalled growth and competition fiercer than ever, you can see why they’re pushing the boat out — or, well, bending the screen back — to try to stand out."
"a report from bloomberg shares some of the details about the long-rumored video streaming service from apple. the company should unveil this service at a press conference in cupertino on march 25. while apple has been working on a ton of original content for its new streaming service, bloomberg says that most of it won’t be ready for the launch later this month. apple will probably share some teasers onstage, but the launch lineup will mostly feature third-party content. apple is probably talking with everyone, but many premium cable channels still have to decide about apple’s streaming service. hbo, showtime and starz have to decide by friday whether they want to be part of the launch. it’s unclear if apple is going to feature some or all content from those partners. many of them already have a streaming service on their own, and you can access their libraries from the tv app on your apple tv or ios device. apple could streamline the experience by letting you subscribe to various content bundles in its own streaming service. amazon already provides something similar with amazon prime video channels. netflix and hulu will likely remain independent services, as they compete directly with apple’s original content effort. when it comes to apple’s other announcement, the company should also unveil its apple news subscription on march 25. apple acquired texture last year and has been working on a digital magazine subscription for a while. unsurprisingly, it looks like apple news' magazine service is prepared to launch on macos too pic.twitter.com/df0oyjxvjf — steve troughton-smith (@stroughtonsmith) march 12, 2019 once again, details are still thin for this new service when it comes to pricing, availability outside of the u.s. and content. last month, the wsj reported that apple has been working with goldman sachs on a credit card that would integrate deeply with the apple wallet app. given that apple’s event is about services, let’s see if the company talks about this new product, as well."
"square today announced the launch of its in-app payments sdk that allows developers to build square-powered payments right into their mobile apps. while square remains best known for its offline payments solutions that grace virtually ever independent coffee shop and quirky corner store, the company has long offered apis for taking online payments on the web and for working with its reader hardware. today’s launch expands the company’s reach into mobile apps, an area where it faces stiff competition from the likes of stripe, adyen and others. square, however, argues that this launch puts it ahead of the competition, given that it now offers a complete online and offline payments solution.“with the introduction of in-app mobile payments to the square platform, developers now have a complete, omnichannel payments solution for all their payment needs,” said square developer lead carl perry in today’s announcement. “from software to hardware to services, square offers a complete payments experience all in one cohesive open platform. even better, developers and sellers can manage all their payments across in-store, mobile and online all in one place.” the sdk is available for android, ios and flutter, google’s toolkit for building cross-platform applications. for now, only developers in the united states, canada, u.k., australia and japan will be able to use it, though. the app provides a default payments flow, but developers can also customize it to match their apps and needs. using this service, mobile app developers will be able to take payments through the usual credit and debit cards, as well as apple pay and google pay."
"in the wake of techcrunch’s investigation yesterday, apple blocked facebook’s research vpn app before the social network could voluntarily shut it down. the research app asked users for root network access to all data passing through their phone in exchange for $20 per month. apple tells techcrunch that yesterday evening it revoked the enterprise certificate that allows facebook to distribute the research app without going through the app store. this not only breaks the research app, but all of facebook’s internal-use employee apps for collaboration and logistics too, from workplace chat to the lunch menu. techcrunch had reported that facebook was breaking apple’s policy that the enterprise system is only for distributing internal corporate apps to employees, not paid external testers. that was actually before facebook released a statement last night saying that it had shut down the ios version of the research program without mentioning that it was forced by apple to do so. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them techcrunch’s investigation discovered that facebook has been quietly operated the research program on ios and android since 2016, recently under the name project atlas. it recruited 13 to 35 year olds, 5 percent of which were teenagers, with ads on instagram and snapchat and paid them a monthly fee plus referral bonuses to install facebook’s research app, the included vpn app that routes traffic to facebook, and to ‘trust’ the company with root network access to their phone. that lets facebook pull in a user’s web browsing activity, what apps are on their phone and how they use them, and even decrypt their encrypted traffic. facebook went so far as to ask users to screenshot and submit their amazon order history. facebook uses all this data to track competitors, assess trends, and plan its product roadmap. facebook was forced to remove its similar onavo protect app in august last year after apple changed its policies to prohibit the vpn app’s data collection practices. but facebook never shut down the research app with the same functionality it was running in parallel. in fact, techcrunch commissioned security expert will strafach to dig into the facebook research app, and we found that it featured tons of similar code and references to onavo protect. that means facebook was purposefully disobeying the spirit of apple’s 2018 privacy policy change while also abusing the enterprise certificate program. sources tell us that apple revoking facebook’s enterprise certificate has broken all of the company’s legitimate employee-only apps. those include pre-launch internal-testing versions of facebook and instagram, as well as the employee apps for coordinating office collaboration, commutes, seeing the day’s lunch schedule, and more. that’s causing mayhem at facebook, disrupting their daily work flow and ability to do product development. we predicted yesterday that apple could take this drastic step to punish facebook much harder than just removing its research app. the disruption will translate into a huge loss of productivity for facebook’s 33,000 employees. [update: facebook later confirmed to techcrunch that its internal apps were broken by apple’s punishment wednesday morning and that it’s in talks with apple to try to resolve the issue and get their employee tools running again. around 3pm pacific on thursday, apple restored facebook’s enterprise certificate, thereby reactivating its internal employee apps. the nearly two work day-long disrupt to its workflow might make facebook think twice about messing with apple again.] for reference, facebook’s main ios app still functions normally. also, you can’t get paid for installing onavo protect on android, only for the facebook research app. and facebook isn’t the only one violating apple’s enterprise certificate policy, as techcrunch discovered google’s screenwise meter surveillance app breaks the rules too. this morning, apple informed us it had banned facebook’s research app yesterday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily. apple provided us with this strongly worded statement condemning the social network’s behavior: “we designed our enterprise developer program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with apple. any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” that comes in direct contradiction to facebook’s initial response to our investigation. facebook claimed it was in alignment with apple’s enterprise certificate policy and that the program was no different than a focus group. seven hours later, a facebook spokesperson said it was pulling its research program from ios without mentioning that apple forced it to do so, and issued this statement disputing the characterization of our story: “key facts about this market research program are being ignored. despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the facebook research app. it wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. all of them with signed parental consent forms.” we refute those accusations by facebook. as we wrote yesterday night, facebook did not publicly promote the research vpn itself and used intermediaries that often didn’t disclose facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process. while users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data facebook can collect through the vpn. a small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative. senator mark warner has since called on facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to support legislation requiring individual informed consent for market research initiatives like facebook research. meanwhile, senator richard blumenthal issued a fierce statement that “wiretapping teens is not research, and it should never be permissible.” the situation will surely worsen the relationship between facebook and apple after years of mounting animosity between the tech giants. apple’s tim cook has repeatedly criticized facebook’s data collection practices, and zuckerberg has countered that it offers products for free for everyone rather than making products few can afford like apple. flared tensions could see facebook receive less promotion in the app store, fewer integrations into ios, and more jabs from cook. meanwhile, the world sees facebook as having been caught red-handed threatening user privacy and breaking apple policy. facebook pays teens to install vpn that spies on them google will stop peddling a data collector through apple’s back door senator warner calls on zuckerberg to support market research consent rules"
"massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate elizabeth warren made waves yesterday when she outlined her plan for breaking up big tech companies like amazon, google and facebook. now, the verge reports warren also wants to break up apple. this, of course, makes sense given that apple falls into the bucket of a platform utility with more than $25 billion in global annual revenues. specifically, warren believes apple should not be able to both run the apple app store and distribute apps in it. “it’s got to be one or the other,” warren told the verge. “either they run the platform or they play in the store. they don’t get to do both at the same time.” warren’s proposal includes passing legislation to designate companies that offer marketplaces, exchanges or platforms for connecting third-parties with annual global revenues of more than $25 billion as “platform utilities.” “these companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,” warren wrote on medium yesterday. “platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.” that would mean amazon, for example, would not be able to sell its amazon basics line of products on its marketplace. same goes for apple, under warren’s proposal. “if you run a platform where others come to sell, then you don’t get to sell your own items on the platform because you have two comparative advantages,” warren said. “one, you’ve sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you’ve made a decision about what you’re going to sell. and second, you have the capacity — because you run the platform — to prefer your product over anyone else’s product. it gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.” in a comment to techcrunch, a spokesperson for warren confirmed that apple is indeed covered by her policy. “they are above $25 billion in revenue and so they would have to structurally separate – choosing between, for example, running the app store or offering their own apps,” the spokesperson said. elizabeth warren wants to break up google, amazon and facebook"
"desperate for data on its competitors, facebook has been secretly paying people to install a “facebook research” vpn that lets the company suck in all of a user’s phone and web activity, similar to facebook’s onavo protect app that apple banned in june and that was removed in august. facebook sidesteps the app store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a techcrunch investigation confirms. facebook admitted to techcrunch it was running the research program to gather data on usage habits. since 2016, facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the ios or android “facebook research” app. facebook even asked users to screenshot their amazon order history page. the program is administered through beta testing services applause, betabound and utest to cloak facebook’s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as “project atlas” — a fitting name for facebook’s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe. seven hours after this story was published, facebook told techcrunch it would shut down the ios version of its research app in the wake of our report. but on wednesday morning, an apple spokesperson confirmed that facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked facebook’s research app on tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so). you can read our full report on the development here. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data an apple spokesperson provided this statement. “we designed our enterprise developer program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with apple. any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.” facebook’s research program will continue to run on android. [update 2/21/19: facebook will pull onavo from the google play store and eventually shut it down. it will also cease to recruit users for the android version of its research app, though it plans other paid research initiatives. facebook’s research app requires users to ‘trust’ it with extensive access to their datawe asked guardian mobile firewall’s security expert will strafach to dig into the facebook research app, and he told us that “if facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.” it’s unclear exactly what data facebook is concerned with, but it gets nearly limitless access to a user’s device once they install the app. the strategy shows how far facebook is willing to go and how much it’s willing to pay to protect its dominance — even at the risk of breaking the rules of apple’s ios platform on which it depends. apple may have asked facebook to discontinue distributing its research app. a more stringent punishment would be to revoke facebook’s permission to offer employee-only apps. the situation could further chill relations between the tech giants. apple’s tim cook has repeatedly criticized facebook’s data collection practices. facebook disobeying ios policies to slurp up more information could become a new talking point. facebook’s research program is referred to as project atlas on sign-up sites that don’t mention facebook’s involvement “the fairly technical sounding ‘install our root certificate’ step is appalling,” strafach tells us. “this hands facebook continuous access to the most sensitive data about you, and most users are going to be unable to reasonably consent to this regardless of any agreement they sign, because there is no good way to articulate just how much power is handed to facebook when you do this.” facebook’s surveillance app facebook first got into the data-sniffing business when it acquired onavo for around $120 million in 2014. the vpn app helped users track and minimize their mobile data plan usage, but also gave facebook deep analytics about what other apps they were using. internal documents acquired by charlie warzel and ryan mac of buzzfeed news reveal that facebook was able to leverage onavo to learn that whatsapp was sending more than twice as many messages per day as facebook messenger. onavo allowed facebook to spot whatsapp’s meteoric rise and justify paying $19 billion to buy the chat startup in 2014. whatsapp has since tripled its user base, demonstrating the power of onavo’s foresight. over the years since, onavo clued facebook in to what apps to copy, features to build and flops to avoid. by 2018, facebook was promoting the onavo app in a protect bookmark of the main facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. facebook also launched the onavo bolt app that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism. onavo’s main app remains available on google play and has been installed more than 10 million times. the backlash heated up after security expert strafach detailed in march how onavo protect was reporting to facebook when a user’s screen was on or off, and its wi-fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the vpn was turned off. in june, apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that’s not necessary for an app to function. apple proceeded to inform facebook in august that onavo protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the app store, which it did, deepa seetharaman of the wsj reported. but that didn’t stop facebook’s data collection. project atlas techcrunch recently received a tip that despite onavo protect being banished by apple, facebook was paying users to sideload a similar vpn app under the facebook research moniker from outside of the app store. we investigated, and learned facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the facebook research app: betabound, utest and applause. facebook began distributing the research vpn app in 2016. it has been referred to as project atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to onavo protect magnified and apple instituted its new rules that prohibited onavo. previously, a similar program was called project kodiak. facebook didn’t want to stop collecting data on people’s phone usage and so the research program continued, in disregard for apple banning onavo protect. facebook’s research app on ios ads (shown below) for the program run by utest on instagram and snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a “paid social media research study.” the sign-up page for the facebook research program administered by applause doesn’t mention facebook, but seeks users “age: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).” if minors try to sign-up, they’re asked to get their parents’ permission with a form that reveal’s facebook’s involvement and says “there are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child’s use of apps. you will be compensated by applause for your child’s participation.” for kids short on cash, the payments could coerce them to sell their privacy to facebook. the applause site explains what data could be collected by the facebook research app (emphasis mine): “by installing the software, you’re giving our client permission to collect data from your phone that will help them understand how you browse the internet, and how you use the features in the apps you’ve installed . . . this means you’re letting our client collect information such as which apps are on your phone, how and when you use them, data about your activities and content within those apps, as well as how other people interact with you or your content within those apps. you are also letting our client collect information about your internet browsing activity (including the websites you visit and data that is exchanged between your device and those websites) and your use of other online services. there are some instances when our client will collect this information even where the app uses encryption, or from within secure browser sessions.” meanwhile, the betabound sign-up page with a url ending in “atlas” explains that “for $20 per month (via e-gift cards), you will install an app on your phone and let it run in the background.” it also offers $20 per friend you refer. that site also doesn’t initially mention facebook, but the instruction manual for installing facebook research reveals the company’s involvement. facebook’s intermediary utest ran ads on snapchat and instagram, luring teens to the research program with the promise of money   facebook seems to have purposefully avoided testflight, apple’s official beta testing system, which requires apps to be reviewed by apple and is limited to 10,000 participants. instead, the instruction manual reveals that users download the app from r.facebook-program.com and are told to install an enterprise developer certificate and vpn and “trust” facebook with root access to the data their phone transmits. apple requires that developers agree to only use this certificate system for distributing internal corporate apps to their own employees. randomly recruiting testers and paying them a monthly fee appears to violate the spirit of that rule. security expert will strafach found facebook’s research app contains lots of code from onavo protect, the facebook-owned app apple banned last year once installed, users just had to keep the vpn running and sending data to facebook to get paid. the applause-administered program requested that users screenshot their amazon orders page. this data could potentially help facebook tie browsing habits and usage of other apps with purchase preferences and behavior. that information could be harnessed to pinpoint ad targeting and understand which types of users buy what. techcrunch commissioned strafach to analyze the facebook research app and find out where it was sending data. he confirmed that data is routed to “vpn-sjc1.v.facebook-program.com” that is associated with onavo’s ip address, and that the facebook-program.com domain is registered to facebook, according to markmonitor. the app can update itself without interacting with the app store, and is linked to the email address peoplejourney@fb.com. he also discovered that the enterprise certificate first acquired in 2016 indicates facebook renewed it on june 27th, 2018 — weeks after apple announced its new rules that prohibited the similar onavo protect app. “it is tricky to know what data facebook is actually saving (without access to their servers). the only information that is knowable here is what access facebook is capable of based on the code in the app. and it paints a very worrisome picture,” strafach explains. “they might respond and claim to only actually retain/save very specific limited data, and that could be true, it really boils down to how much you trust facebook’s word on it. the most charitable narrative of this situation would be that facebook did not think too hard about the level of access they were granting to themselves . . . which is a startling level of carelessness in itself if that is the case.” [update: techcrunch also found that google’s screenwise meter surveillance app also breaks the enterprise certificate policy, though it does a better job of revealing the company’s involvement and how it works than facebook does.] google will stop peddling a data collector through apple’s back door “flagrant defiance of apple’s rules” in response to techcrunch’s inquiry, a facebook spokesperson confirmed it’s running the program to learn how people use their phones and other services. the spokesperson told us “like many companies, we invite people to participate in research that helps us identify things we can be doing better. since this research is aimed at helping facebook understand how people use their mobile devices, we’ve provided extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate. we don’t share this information with others and people can stop participating at any time.” facebook’s research app requires root certificate access, which facebook gather almost any piece of data transmitted by your phone facebook’s spokesperson claimed that the facebook research app was in line with apple’s enterprise certificate program, but didn’t explain how in the face of evidence to the contrary. they said facebook first launched its research app program in 2016. they tried to liken the program to a focus group and said nielsen and comscore run similar programs, yet neither of those ask people to install a vpn or provide root access to the network. the spokesperson confirmed the facebook research program does recruit teens but also other age groups from around the world. they claimed that onavo and facebook research are separate programs, but admitted the same team supports both as an explanation for why their code was so similar. facebook’s research program requested users screenshot their amazon order history to provide it with purchase data however, facebook’s claim that it doesn’t violate apple’s enterprise certificate policy is directly contradicted by the terms of that policy. those include that developers “distribute provisioning profiles only to your employees and only in conjunction with your internal use applications for the purpose of developing and testing”. the policy also states that “you may not use, distribute or otherwise make your internal use applications available to your customers” unless under direct supervision of employees or on company premises. given facebook’s customers are using the enterprise certificate-powered app without supervision, it appears facebook is in violation. seven hours after this report was first published, facebook updated its position and told techcrunch that it would shut down the ios research app. facebook noted that the research app was started in 2016 and was therefore not a replacement for onavo protect. however, they do share similar code and could be seen as twins running in parallel. a facebook spokesperson also provided this additional statement: “key facts about this market research program are being ignored. despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the facebook research app. it wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. all of them with signed parental consent forms.” facebook did not publicly promote the research vpn itself and used intermediaries that often didn’t disclose facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process. while users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data facebook can collect through the vpn. a small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative. facebook disobeying apple so directly and then pulling the app could hurt their relationship. “the code in this ios app strongly indicates that it is simply a poorly re-branded build of the banned onavo app, now using an enterprise certificate owned by facebook in direct violation of apple’s rules, allowing facebook to distribute this app without apple review to as many users as they want,” strafach tells us. onv prefixes and mentions of graph.onavo.com, “onavoapp://” and “onavoprotect://” custom url schemes litter the app. “this is an egregious violation on many fronts, and i hope that apple will act expeditiously in revoking the signing certificate to render the app inoperable.” facebook is particularly interested in what teens do on their phones as the demographic has increasingly abandoned the social network in favor of snapchat, youtube and facebook’s acquisition instagram. insights into how popular with teens is chinese video music app tiktok and meme sharing led facebook to launch a clone called lasso and begin developing a meme-browsing feature called lol, techcrunch first reported. but facebook’s desire for data about teens riles critics at a time when the company has been battered in the press. analysts on tomorrow’s facebook earnings call should inquire about what other ways the company has to collect competitive intelligence now that it’s ceased to run the research program on ios. last year when tim cook was asked what he’d do in mark zuckerberg’s position in the wake of the cambridge analytica scandal, he said “i wouldn’t be in this situation . . . the truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. we’ve elected not to do that.” zuckerberg told ezra klein that he felt cook’s comment was “extremely glib.” now it’s clear that even after apple’s warnings and the removal of onavo protect, facebook was still aggressively collecting data on its competitors via apple’s ios platform. “i have never seen such open and flagrant defiance of apple’s rules by an app store developer,” strafach concluded. now that facebook has ceased the program on ios and its android future is uncertain, it may either have to invent new ways to surveil our behavior amidst a climate of privacy scrutiny, or be left in the dark. apple bans facebook’s research app that paid users for data additional reporting by zack whittaker. updated with comment from facebook, and on wednesday with a statement from apple."
"hole punches aside, wireless powershare is the s10 line’s marquee feature. samsung’s new flagship isn’t the first handset with the feature — the huawei mate 20 pro beat it to it by a few months — but it’s a cool new addition, nonetheless. and perhaps more importantly, samsung’s beat apple to the punch here. from the looks of it, cupertino has been having all manner of difficulty bringing wireless tech to market — just look at the mia airpower charger. the feature relies on the s10’s large battery to charge other devices. so, say, when you’re out on the town and a friend is teetering on the brink of phone death, you just swipe down into the settings, enable wireless powershare, and you can save the day by placing the handsets back to back. the new feature should be compatible with all phones that charge via the qi standard. they also work with samsung’s new galaxy buds, which beat the airpods to the punch with a wireless charging case. of course, one of the phone needs to be face down for this to work, and wireless charging is slower than plugged in, but a cool feature nonetheless. it’s one that should come in handy for frequent travels. that’s one fewer device you have to plug in to charge overnight."
"“the breaker upperers” kicks off with an ingenious premise: what if you could pay an agency to take care of your awkward romantic break-ups? and what if that agency was run by two longtime friends who are starting to drift apart? the film was a big hit in new zealand last year and is now available to global audiences on netflix. jackie van beek and madeleine sami joined this week’s original content podcast to talk about writing, directing and starring in the movie together. “i was thinking about how many conversations i’d had with people about the level of dread that they have when they realize they have to break up with their partner,” van beek said. “i mean, nobody enjoys it. i thought, you could make a lot of money doing that for somebody or offering to do that for somebody.” the pair also discussed shooting a sex scene with jemaine clement of “flight of the conchords,” and finding room for improvisation on a relatively short, low-budget shoot. the movie was executive produced by taika waititi, director of “thor: ragnarok,” a film that sami credited with exposing global audiences to a similar style of humor. both filmmakers said they never expected “the breaker upperers” to find an audience outside new zealand, so they’re delighted to be launching on netflix . “it’s fun, it’s colorful, it’s not too long, it’s just the right length,” van beek added. “i reckon it’s the most amazing movie to watch on a chair, or on a couch, or even lying down on a sheepskin with your legs in the air. like any kind of position, i think.” after the interview, we’re joined by brian heater to follow-up on last week’s brief review of “russian doll” — this time, we go deep into spoilers, discussing the twists that kept us hooked and how the “groundhog day”-style storyline ultimately wrapped up. you can listen in the player below, subscribe using apple podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice. if you like the show, please let us know by leaving a review on apple. you also can send us feedback directly.

"deep learning involves a highly iterative process where data scientists build models and test them on gpu-powered systems until they get something they can work with. it can be expensive and time-consuming, often taking weeks to fashion the right model. new startup determined ai wants to change that by making the process faster, cheaper and more efficient. it emerged from stealth today with $11 million in series a funding. the round was led by gv (formerly google ventures) with help from amplify partners, haystack and sv angel. the company also announced an earlier $2.6 million seed round from 2017, for a total $13.6 million raised to date. evan sparks, co-founder and ceo at determined ai, says that up until now, only the largest companies like facebook, google, apple and microsoft could set up the infrastructure and systems to produce sophisticated ai like self-driving cars and voice recognition technologies. “our view is that a big reason why [these big companies] can do that is that they all have internal software infrastructure that enables their teams of machine learning engineers and data scientists to be effective and produce applications quickly,” sparks told techcrunch. determined’s idea is to create software to handle everything from managing cluster compute resources to automating workflows, thereby putting some of that big-company technology within reach of any organization. “what we exist to do is to build that software for everyone else,” he said. the target market is fortune 500 and global 2000 companies. the company’s solution is based on research conducted over the last several years at amplab at the university of california, berkeley (which is probably best known for developing apache spark). it used the knowledge generated in the lab to build sophisticated solutions that help make better use of a customer’s gpu resources. “we are offering kind of a base layer that is scheduling and resource sharing for these highly expensive resources, and then on top of that we’ve layered some services around workflow automation.” sparks said the team has generated state of the art results that are somewhere between five and 50 times faster than the results from tools that are available to most companies today. for now, the startup is trying to help customers move away from generic kinds of solutions currently available to more customized approaches, using determined ai tools to help speed up the ai production process. the money from today’s round should help fuel growth, add engineers and continue building the solution."
"according to a new report from the wsj, apple and goldman sachs are partnering on a different kind of product for both companies — a credit card. the mastercard-based card would be focused on apple pay and feature some deep integrations in ios. this card could launch later this year in the u.s., which would coincide with the next iphone. an apple credit card would be a good way to take a bigger cut on apple pay transactions. instead of splitting fees between the card issuer, the card network and apple, apple would get a portion of the fees for the card issuer. it could also be a way to evangelize apple pay. while most cards are now compatible with apple pay in the u.s., many people still don’t think about paying with their iphone or apple watch. this is also uncharted territory for goldman sachs . according to the wsj, the new card would represent goldman’s first card. the company could be investing as much as $200 million to build a support team and the it infrastructure to handle payments. you could expect cash back on some purchases. more interestingly, apple could also be working on an apple wallet overhaul for this credit card. you would be able to set up spending goals (like the rings in the activity app), get notifications about your spending habits (like screen time) and track your rewards. it’s unclear if apple plans to open up those new features to other banks. by partnering with apple, goldman sachs would get a great distribution channel. and by launching a card, apple would prove once again that, given enough time, all companies eventually become banks."
"the growth of augmented and virtual reality applications and hardware is ushering in a new age of digital media and imaging technologies, and startups that are putting themselves at the center of that are attracting interest. techcrunch has learned and confirmed that matterport — which started out making cameras but has since diversified into a wider platform to capture, create, search and utilise 3d imagery of interior and enclosed spaces in immersive real estate, design, insurance and other b2c and b2b applications — has raised $48 million. sources tell us the money came at a pre-money valuation of around $325 million, although the company is not commenting on that. from what we understand, the funding is coming ahead of a larger growth round from existing and new investors, to tap into what they see as a big opportunity for building and providing (as a service) highly accurate 3d images of enclosed spaces. the company in december appointed a new ceo, rj pittman — who had been the chief product officer at ebay, and before that held executive roles at apple and google — to help fill out that bigger strategy. matterport had raised just under $63 million prior to this and had been valued at around $207 million, according to pitchbook estimates.this current round is coming from existing backers, which include lux capital, dcm, qualcomm ventures and more. matterport’s roots are in high-end cameras built to capture multiple images to create 3d interior imagery for a variety of applications, from interior design and real estate to gaming. changing tides in the worlds of industry and hardware have somewhat shifted its course. on the hardware side, we’ve seen a rise in the functionality of smartphone cameras, as well as a proliferation of specialised 3d cameras at lower price points. so while matterport still sells its own high-end cameras, it is also starting to work with less expensive devices with spherical lenses — such as the ricoh theta, which is nearly 10 times less expensive than matterport’s pro2 camera — and smartphones. using an ai engine — which it has been building for some time — packaged into a service it calls matterport cloud 3.0, it converts 2d panoramic and 360-degree images into 3d images. (matterport cloud 3.0 is currently in beta and will be launching fully on the 18th of march, initially supporting the ricoh theta v, the theta z1, the insta360 one x and the leica geosystems blk360 laser scanner.) matterport is further using this technology to grow its wider database of images. it already has racked up 1.6 million 3d images and millions of 2d images, and at its current growth rate, the aim is to expand its library to 100 million in the coming years, positioning it as a getty for 3d enclosed images. these, in turn, will be used in two ways: to feed matterport’s machine learning to train it to create better and faster 3d images; and to become part of a wider library, accessible to other businesses by way of a set of apis. and, from what i understand, the object will not just be to use images as they are: people would be able to manipulate the images to, for example, remove all the furniture in a room and re-stage it completely without needing to physically do that work ahead of listing a house for sale. another is adding immersive interior shots into mapping applications like google’s street view. “we are a data company,” pittman told me when i met him for coffee last month. the ability to convert 2d into 3d images using artificial intelligence to help automate the process is a potentially big area that matterport, and its investors, believe will be in increasing demand. that’s not just because people still think there will one day be a bigger market for virtual reality headsets, which will need more interesting content, but because we as consumers already have come to expect more realistic and immersive experiences today, even when viewing things on regular screens — and because b2b and enterprise services (for example design or insurance applications) have also grown in sophistication and now require these kinds of images. (that demand is driving the creation of other kinds of 3d imaging startups, too. threedy.ai launched last week with a seed round from a number of angels and vcs to perform a similar kind of 2d-to-3d mapping technique for objects rather than interior spaces. it is already working with a number of e-commerce sites to bypass some of the costs and inefficiencies of more established, manual methods of 3d rendering.) while matterport is doubling down on its cloud services strategy, it also has been making some hires to take the business to its next steps. in addition to pittman, they have added dave lippman, formerly design head at ebay, as its chief design officer; and engineering veteran lou marzano as its vp of hardware, r&d and manufacturing, with more hires to come."
"apple is slowly building a lineup of content subscriptions. according to a report from cheddar, apple may also be working on a gaming subscription. alex heath managed to get five people to talk about the rumored service. if apple goes ahead and launches such a service, users could pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games. it’s still unclear how much it would cost and what would be included in the subscription. given that many ios games are now free-to-play games, it’s hard to see how it would work. apple could choose to focus on paid games and provide those games as part of the subscription. the company could also give you free coins and perks when it comes to free-to-play games. apple has to talk with potential partners to put together the service — that’s probably how cheddar learned about apple’s plans. the company isn’t going to develop a bunch of games overnight (remember apple’s texas hold ‘em?). but it could act as a sort of game publisher by promoting and distributing new games in a subscription tier. games are by far the most popular category on the app store. they generate a ton of downloads and revenue. and it sounds like apple thinks it could generate more revenue by switching to a different business model, beyond the usual 30 percent cut on in-app purchases. apple has also been signing deals with tv producers in order to put together a streaming service. the company wants to compete with netflix and other streaming platforms. apple has been working on a magazine subscription service, as well. the company acquired texture back in march 2018 to build the foundation of the service. and that new subscription should launch pretty soon. you can find a landing page for apple news magazines in the beta version of ios 12.2. and, of course, apple has attracted 56 million subscribers for apple music. now let’s see if the company can replicate the same success with other services."
"facebook has only just recovered from one of its worst outages to date, and gmail and google drive also experienced a worldwide outage this week. now, apparently, it was apple’s turn. the company’s system status dashboard was blanketed in yellow warning notes for more than four hours thursday, indicating mass outages of its icloud service. icloud drive, mail, calendar, notes, keychain, reminders, iwork, photos, news and others all experienced downtime. the issues lasted from 11:00 am to 3:28 pm (et). the page didn’t offer much in terms of detail as to why the services experienced problems, only saying that “some users are affected” and “users may be unable to access this service.” apple didn’t say what caused the outage once icloud recovered. (screenshot: techcrunch) apple’s icloud issues arrive on the heels of facebook’s massive outage, which impacted its 2.3 billion users across its properties — including facebook, instagram, whatsapp and messenger — for more than a day, becoming the site’s largest-ever outage. the social networking company chalked up the problem to a “server configuration change,” not a cyberattack as some had been speculating. that hasn’t stopped people from continuing to believe the series of outages seen this week are related. but it’s simply too soon to draw any conclusions. there’s not enough being provided by the companies themselves to fully understand the nature of what’s happened, nor what caused the issues with icloud. fair to say, it has been a bad week for the internet. (did anyone try turning it off and back on again?) when reached, apple declined to comment. updated once the outage had resolved. h/t: macrumors & appleinsider"
"apple has disabled the group calling feature within its facetime calling service while it works on a patch to fix a nasty bug that allows eavesdropping. apple’s status page shows that group calling via facetime is “temporarily unavailable” — that’s a stop-gap move while the company works to deliver a more permanent fix to the problem this week. we were unable to set up a group call when we tried, having earlier been able to do so and replicate the issue. all being well, this fix means that users don’t need to completely disable facetime due to the bug, but it is understandable if some people are hesitant to switch it on again. the vulnerability was unearthed on monday; it is activated when a user initiates a group call but adds themselves as a participant, as we explained in our earlier post: the bug relies on what appears to be a nasty logic screwup in facetime’s group call system. while we’re opting to not outline the steps here, the bug seems to trick the recipient’s phone into thinking a group call is already ongoing. a few quick taps, and facetime immediately trips over itself and inexplicably fires up the recipient’s microphone without them actually accepting the call. weirder yet: if the recipient presses the volume down button or the power button to try to silence or dismiss the call, their camera turns on as well. though the recipient’s phone display continues showing the incoming call screen, their microphone/camera are streaming. apple told us and other media that it plans to issue a more permanent solution in the coming days. “we’re aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week,” a spokesperson said. it’s interesting to note that the group calling feature actually took longer than planned to arrive in ios following a hiccup. it was added then removed from the beta version of ios 12 in august while it took time to roll out to all users. the feature was absent when ios 12 shipped to all in september and, instead, it arrived with the launch of ios 12.1 in october. apple never provided a reason for the delay. the bug is an embarrassing incident for apple, which has long emphasized its focus on privacy as a business and within its products. that included a recent banner at ces, which triumphantly proclaimed: “what happens on your iphone, stays on your iphone.”"
"i get a little giddy at the notion of another ipod. it’s almost entirely nostalgic, of course. and apple long ago abandoned my own favorite, the definitely dead ipod classic. the touch, on the other hand, just kind of faded away. “the king is gone, but he’s not forgotten,” neil young once sang. but 2019 could mark a sort of return for the final iteration of the beloved music device — which, toward the end more closely resembled a cellular-free iphone than any of its predecessors. what form a new ipod touch might take is uncertain, but a couple of breadcrumbs have suggested that the line might have a little life left in it, after all. earlier this month, a report tied to supply chain sources suggested a potential redesign of the hardware. that came alongside news that the iphone might finally switch to usb-c. that would put the devices in line with the latest ipad pro, and could signal a larger company-wide shift toward the more ubiquitous port. whether or not the music-focused product would drop both lightning and the headphone jack is just one of a million questions around the potential refresh. this week meanwhile, eagle-eyed steve troughton-smith noted an “ipod 9,1” among the apple products listed in the ios 12.2 code. the list also appears to confirm recent rumors around the addition of a new ipad. tellingly, the ipod listing doesn’t include face id or touch id, which could be an attempt to keep the device at a reasonable price.  of course, the ubiquity of the iphone and other handsets, along with the exponential growth of streaming services like spotify and apple music, have dampened the necessity of music-only hardware devices. still, as i noted in my bit of palm phone wish-fulfillment, some days an ipod would hit the spot."
"pressed to explain who is using them, and why, 99 percent of cryptocurrencies let out all their air, go flying around the room making a raspberry sound, hit the wall and fall behind the couch forever. the party is over. a few, however, can present a credible use case. “tokenized securities” could be one of them: a more open and efficient way to transact shares and notes as well as distribute cash flows. proponents of “security token offerings” (stos) have been telling that story now for a little more than a year. this data report canvases the market, finds few are buying it, interviews market participants for perspective and reveals gaps in the use case at the ground level that explain its failure to thrive. in october 2017, the market for “initial coin offerings,” or icos, reached a peak, with more than 100 capital raises closing through the sale of crypto tokens, according to market data provider token data. proponents thought these tokens were an innovation on par with the joint stock corporation: not a claim on cash flows, but a vessel to participate in and directly capture the value latent in network effects. “tokenized” networks raising money that month ranged from the prosaic, like a no-fee crypto exchange called cobinhood ($13.2 million), to the ludicrous, like dentacoin, “the blockchain solution for the global dental industry” ($1.1 million). at the time, it was nearly unheard-of for such a project to acknowledge its token might be a security like the mundane stock certificate. in the following months, the us securities and exchange commission (sec) sent dozens of subpoenas to token issuers, indicating that they disagreed. by the following march, the number of sec registrations for new token offerings equaled more than half the total ico deal activity for the month. as sec moved in and icos cooled, a new enthusiasm for paperwork the sudden popularity in 2018 of the so-called “security token” was undoubtedly a scramble to paper over cash grabs. however, there is a use case for “tokenized securities” that is worth considering. bitcoin showed how ownership could be digitally secured and transferred without intermediaries. a tokenized security could do the same for investment contracts. “smart contracts” are a value proposition that has been discussed in cryptocurrency since long before bitcoin. there is reason to be optimistic that this form of programmable ownership can bring efficiency, transparency, liquidity and access to the $1.7 trillion annual us private placement market. the value proposition is that smart contracts will reduce the cost of compliance in primary issuance and secondary trading. issuers benefit by reduced liquidity premiums and more buyers to compete for their offering. investors benefit by gaining more access to opportunities for growth-stage investment. this is a compelling story in us capital markets that have, for nearly two decades, starved retail investors of exposure to growth-stage investments. decline of the small-cap ipo reduced retail opportunities for risk & return this value proposition, and a narrative of regulatory chill in the markets, have led some to believe that tokenized securities would bring back a bull market in crypto. the wall street hype machine has moved on from crypto; security tokens are one of the few areas in which the avid listener can detect faint echoes of its passing. media hype “if it works you’re going to see tremors across wall street.” -cnbc commentator “apple and tesla shares on the blockchain could be the next big thing” -cnbc headline “2019: the year digital securities offerings become the new icos” -coindesk “why security token offerings are replacing initial coin offerings” -silicon valley business journal from 30,000 feet up, the use case for tokenized securities looks compelling. as with many blockchain-based projects, zoom down to the user level and misaligned incentives appear for key market participants. investors: digital tokens carry technological risk, regulatory risk and market risk. without a liquid market ready and waiting, private placement investors have little incentive to layer risk on top of the risk-return they already understand. brokers: effective bankers and broker-dealers charge a premium for primary issuance; the more effective they are, the less incentive they have to adopt, especially given their investors are not clamoring for this product. issuers: with markets awash in private capital, there are very few quality issuers that cannot raise funds. the better the investment opportunity, the likelier its access to funds and investment banks in the top quartile, where investment decisions have kingmaker effects in the market. interest in innovation that disrupts these relationships is therefore inversely related to suitability for capital, a repeat of the pattern in us issuers accessing new equity crowdfunding options under the jobs act of 2012. if you build it, will they come? to determine whether new tokenized security issuance is finding a fit in the market, canary data, an open crypto research initiative, undertook an exhaustive search of news wires and the sec’s edgar database, beginning in 2017 and ending mid-january, looking for public statements and filings related to security token offerings. it’s an imperfect method; our database of offerings is constantly evolving as new information becomes available. but in an emerging segment of the financial markets it reflects the level of credible, mainstream activity. we filtered out tokens that are in the mold of the ico “utility token,” offering a financial instrument as a form of access to a valuable network effect. many of these have registered as securities, but it is the value proposition of a tokenized tradtional security — a claim on cash flow, represented as a token — that we are interested in."
"tv provider dish is more tightly integrating its hopper line of receivers with google assistant by integrating the smart assistant directly into its set-top boxes. the company was already working with google on a voice-controlled experience, having announced a year ago at ces that it would allow customers to control their dish tv experience using google assistant. however, in that case, dish customers had to first pair their hopper devices with an existing google assistant device in their home. this new development, announced today at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, is integrating the google assistant technology directly into the hopper hardware itself. that means dish subscribers will be able to use their dish voice remote to talk to google assistant in order to control their dish tv. they can also search for tv content by channel, title, actor or genre. dish tv viewers will be able to do other things with google assistant, too — like check the weather, get news updates, display photos and control their other connected devices around the home.the new feature, the company hopes, will make dish’s tv service more compelling in a day and age where many consumers are cutting the cord with pay tv and turning to streaming media devices like apple tv, fire tv, android tv and roku — all of which now have their own voice control and voice search capabilities. dish isn’t only working with google for voice control. in fact, it was one of the first to leverage amazon alexa for hands-free voice control of its hopper and wally receivers back in 2017. however, the alexa integration was limited to pairing the dish receiver with alexa through an alexa skill."
"just in time for the new year, a report from net marketshare puts windows 10 in the top spot for desktop operating systems. it’s the first time microsoft’s os took the top spot since hitting the market three and a half years ago. at 39.22 percent of the market, windows 10’s rise isn’t an overnight success story, but it’s notable, given the rocky reception its other operating systems have received in recent years. windows 10 just edges out windows 7’s 36.90. the more recent windows 8.1, meanwhile, is a distant fifth — more than a percentage point below windows xp. windows 10 is now in place on 700 million devices, comprising a broad range of products. microsoft gambled with the release of a convertible operating system that could bridge the device between pc and tablet, and it appears to have paid off. as has the decision to bring the os to its xbox platform. the numbers look solid, even as some enterprise customers continue to drag their feet. that’s to be expected with any relatively new operating system, as anyone who’s ever worked for a large business can tell you. there’s a reason xp is still in the top five. all of this marks a nice end to microsoft’s solid year, which found it once again at the top of the most valuable companies. apple, which is now in the no. 2 spot, secured no. 3 on the os list, with 10.14 mojave pulling in 4.73 percent of the market."
"bay area photography startup polarr announced this morning that it has raised an $11.5 million series a. the new round of funding, led by threshold ventures with participation from pear ventures and cota capital, brings the startup’s total funding to around $13.5 million, according to the company. at the moment, the company is probably best known for its photography app for ios and android, which utilizes machine learning and ai to improve image editing. the company says it has around four million monthly active users. this round of funding will go toward research and development, engineering and partnerships, the latter of which are starting to become a big business for polarr. in fact, it’s using the news to highlight the fact that it was tapped to bring its technology to the samsung galaxy s10’s native camera app. polarr has previously teamed with other big hardware names, including qualcomm and oppo. “as deep learning compute shifts from the cloud to edge devices, there is a growing opportunity to provide sophisticated and creative edge ai technologies to mobile devices,” ceo borui wang said in a release tied to the news. “this new round of financing is a tangible endorsement of our approach to enable and inspire everyone to make beautiful creations.” polarr’s tech is becoming increasingly valuable as phone makers look to differentiate their handsets’ imaging outside of the hardware. notable recent generations of handsets from top companies like samsung, apple and google have leaned heavily on ai and ml updates to stand out from the crowd."
"two older iphone models are back on sale in apple stores in germany — but only with qualcomm chips inside. the iphone maker was forced to pull the iphone 7 and iphone 8 models from shelves in its online shop and physical stores in the country last month, after chipmaker qualcomm posted security bonds to enforce a december court injunction it secured via patent litigation. apple told reuters it had “no choice” but to stop using some intel chips for handsets to be sold in germany. “qualcomm is attempting to use injunctions against our products to try to get apple to succumb to their extortionist demands,” it said in a statement provided to the news agency. apple and qualcomm have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter global legal battle around patents and licensing terms for several years. the litigation follows cupertino’s move away from using only qualcomm’s chips in iphones after, in 2016, apple began sourcing modem chips from rival intel — dropping qualcomm chips entirely for last year’s iphone models. though still using some qualcomm chips for older iphone models, as it will now for iphone 7 and iphone 8 units headed to germany. for these handsets apple is swapping out intel modems. although the injunction obtained by qualcomm via the patent litigation affects chips from another chipmaker, qorvo, according to reuters. the litigation itself relates to a patented smartphone power management technology. an intel spokesman told us that qorvo chips are not contained in its modems and are a separate part, sourced separately by phone makers. “the modem and the qorvo chip do interact with each other for power management,” he said. despite that, apple has swapped out intel components in the handsets headed to germany, where its local webstore is again listing the two older iphone models for sale… newer iphones containing intel chips remain on sale in germany because they do not containing the same components subject to the patent injunction. “intel’s modem products are not involved in this lawsuit and are not subject to this or any other injunction,” intel’s general counsel, steven rodgers, said in a statement to reuters. while apple’s decision to restock its shelves with qualcomm-only iphone 7s and 8s represents a momentary victory for qualcomm, a separate german court tossed another of its patent suits against apple last month — dismissing it as groundless. (qualcomm said it would appeal.) the chipmaker has also been pursing patent litigation against apple in china, and in december apple appealed a preliminary injunction banning the import and sales of old iphone models in the country. at the same time, qualcomm and apple are both waiting the result of an antitrust trial brought against qualcomm’s licensing terms in the u.s. two years ago the ftc filed charges against qualcomm, accusing the chipmaker of operating a monopoly and forcing exclusivity from apple while charging “excessive” licensing fees for standards-essential patents. the case was heard last month and is pending a verdict or settlement. this report was updated with a correction after we reported that qorvo chips are contained in intel modems. in fact intel told us the qorvo components are separate to its modems and separately sourced by device makers"
"if you think times are bad at apple, spare a thought for htc, the once king-of-the-hill phone maker that continues to struggle very badly. the taiwanese smartphone company, which offloaded a portion of its business to google for $1.1 billion and is pivoting to vr, laid off yet more staff in 2018 and had its worst year of sales ever. according to its own figures — and as noted by bloomberg’s tim culpan — the company brought in just 23.74 billion twd ($770 million) in revenue over the entire year. that’s the first time it has grossed less than $1 billion during a year as a public company. that figure represents a massive 62 percent drop on htc’s paltry revenue for 2017 — 62.12 billion twd, around $2 billion — which was its poorest year since 2005. we don’t yet know the total loss for 2018, but its three previous quarterly reports combined amount to a total operating loss of 11.13 billion twd, $361 million, with one more quarter to add.htc’s 2018 total was so bad that it actually made more money during just one single month a few years ago. its total revenue during may 2013, back when phones like the one m7, one mini and one max made it one of the best smartphone companies on the planet, came in at 29 billion twd. those days of booming sales are, of course, long gone as these charts painfully illustrate. the decision to sell a large chunk of the smartphone business to google one year ago was the icing on the cake served at htc’s smartphone wake. yes, the company did announce the u12+ — with a squeezable side — in may and it is working on a blockchain phone that we kind of got a look at during our shenzhen event last year, but these are peripheral plays that are tucked well away from where the mainstream players are dueling, a place where htc used to be.even vr, trumpeted as htc’s great area of hope, is a long-term play. the company doesn’t break down revenue — that’ll come later when it releases its next earnings report in february — so we don’t know how its vive and other virtual reality plays are working out in terms of numbers. but the immediate future isn’t great. lucas matney — techcrunch’s resident virtual reality cyberpunk — noted just this week that 2019 is shaping up to be a very testing year for the entire vr and ar industry, htc/vive very much included. “there are plenty of reasons to be long-term bullish on ar, but the time horizons some have espoused seems to be bogus and pitch decks organized around a near-term spike in phone-based or glasses-based users are going to have a tougher time being taken seriously in 2019,” matney wrote. if that proves true, htc’s sickly sales may well contract further still. htc is gone in many ways, it’s hard to not feel sorry for the company. pivots this brutal are usually carried out by private startups who can keep the contents of their books to themselves, rather than 22-year-old public companies that must file financial statements. unfortunately for htc, information like monthly sales, losses and other revealing data will continue to be public information, ensuring that this painful transition continues to play out with full public scrutiny. despite an incredible downturn in success, co-founder, president and ceo cher wang continues to run the business with no calls for a change in leadership. wang keeps a low profile and has said little of her plans to turn things around. maybe 2019 is a good year for being more forthcoming, especially if the losses continue to mount, as seems inevitable."
"snapchat isn’t growing again, but at least it didn’t hemorrhage any more users in its q4 earnings report. the company stayed flat at 186 million daily users after falling from 191 million in q1 to 188 million in q2 to 186 million in q3. it exceeded an expected quarterly count of 184.2 million user, though 186 million is still down 0.3 percent year-over-year. it reached record revenue of $390 million in the holiday quarter, up 36 percent year-over-year to beat the $378 million wall street estimate, and snapchat lost just $0.04 per share compared to wall street’s $0.08 loss estimate for a beat in q4 earnings. the highlight of the earnings report was that snap has managed a 68 percent year-over-year improvement in its adjusted ebitda losses, which came in at $50 million (though net loss was still $158 million). with 43 percent full-year revenue growth in 2018, “this limited our q4 losses to just 13 percent of our revenue, compared to just one year ago when our q4 losses totaled more than 50 percent of revenue” ceo evan spiegel wrote in his opening remarks. that means snap might make it to profitability in the next year or two before running out of cash and having to take more from big investors or consider being acquired. after closing at $7.04 today, snap was up around 17 percent in after hours trading to hover around $8.27 — still way down from a peak of $20.75 a year ago. importantly, snapchat grew its europe user count from 59 million to 60 million and stayed flat at 79 million in north america. since those are its two best monetizing markets, stopping the shrinkage there was critical. that helped spur a 37 percent year-over-year increase in global average revenue per user, and a 30 percent boost over q3. looking forward, snap expects between $285 million and $310 million in q1 2019, which would be a 24 percent to 34 percent year-over-year increase, while its adjusted ebitda losses are expected to be between $165 million and $140 million, down from $218 million in q1. it ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and securities. on the content and engagement front, snap is reaching 70 percent of total us 13 to 34 year olds with premium mobile video, which could be very lucrate if it can keep its user count stable or growing. 70 precent of users played with or viewed a lens each day, though snap didn’t provide an update on its snaps created per day metric that’s useful for judging the health of its messaging feature. but it does say that users still average 30 minutes per day on the app. 30 percent more people are watching its discover section’s publisher stories and shows every day versus last year, with snapchat’s new algorithmically personalized bitmoji stories seeing 40 million viewers in december. that’s powerful because since snap makes the content in-house, it doesn’t have to share ad revenue with anyone. meanwhile, snapchat announced it’s finally starting to roll out its android rebuild to some users, and the initial test results were promising. app startup time was reduced 20 percent, and the improvements could reinvigorate snapchat for android’s growth after years of bugs and slow loading dragging down snapchat’s user count. snapchat’s future hinges on its ability to get to profitability so it can keep financing r&d in augmented reality and hardware. snap won’t be able to keep up with dedicated ar companies like magic leap or tech giants like facebook and apple if it’s constantly trying to cut costs. it could still be years before fashionable and useful ar eyewear is feasible and snap must weather the storm until then. the fact that it’s no longer bleeding users and its losses are falling shows great progress in that direction. most tech giants like apple and google end up sitting on their cash, unsure what to invest in. snapchat seems to have plenty of options if it can just start stockpiling cash instead of spending it all. snapchat’s android usage keeps falling but rebuild tests promising"

"apple isn’t the only smartphone maker steeling itself (and analysts) for disappointing results. samsung electronics issued earnings guidance for the final quarter of 2018 today that not only marks its first quarterly profit decline in two years, but also fell far below analysts’ expectations. the company attributed the drop to lower-than-expected demand for its memory chips, which in previous quarters had helped bolster its earnings even when its smartphone business was lackluster. samsung electronics said it expects consolidated operating profit of about 10.8 trillion won ($9.67 billion), a 28.7 percent drop from the 15.15 trillion won it recorded in the same period a year ago, and below the 13.2 trillion won that analysts polled by thomson reuters had predicted. consolidated sales are expected to be about 59 trillion won, a 10.6 percent decrease from 65.98 trillion won a year ago ($52.9 billion). analysts had estimated sales of 62.8 trillion won. in a statement, the company said “we expect earnings to remain subdued in the first quarter of 2019 due to difficult conditions for the memory business,” thanks to unexpectedly weak demand from some of its data center customers. last week samsung rival apple lowered its first-quarter earnings guidance, as ceo tim cook said that the company now expected revenue of $84 billion, down from its initial projection of $89 billion to $93 billion. the company blamed sluggish demand in emerging markets, but, in general, the smartphone market has been underwhelming over the past two years. about a year ago, gartner recorded the first ever decline for global smartphone sales since 2004, when it first began tracking the market. it attributed the drop to two main factors: fewer feature phone owners upgrading to smartphones because of the lack of quality “ultra-low-cost” smartphones, and current smartphone owners deciding to buy and keep quality devices for longer periods of time."
"announcements that apple has partnered with aetna health insurance on a new app leveraging data from its apple watch and reports that verily — one of the health-focused subsidiaries of google‘s parent company, alphabet — is developing a shoe that can detect weight and movement, indicate increasing momentum around using data from wearables for clinical health applications and treatments. for venture capital investors, the move from apple and alphabet to show new applications for wearable devices is a step in the right direction — and something that’s been long overdue. “as a healthcare provider, we talk a lot about the importance of preventative medicine, but the us healthcare system doesn’t have the right incentives in place to pay for it,” writes cameron sepah, an entrepreneur in residence at trinity ventures. “since large employers largely pay for health care (outside of medicaid and medicare), they usually aren’t incentivized to pay for prevention, since employees don’t stay long enough for them to incur the long-term costs of health behaviors. so most startups in this space end up becoming an expendable wellness perk for companies. however, if an insurer like aetna keeps its members long enough, there’s better alignment for disseminating this app.” sepah sees broader implications for the tie-ups between health insurers and the tech companies making all sorts of devices to detect and diagnose conditions. “most patients’ relationship with their insurer is just getting paper bills/notifications in the mail, with terrible customer satisfaction (nps) across the board,” sepah wrote in an email. “but when there’s a way to build a closer relationship through a device that sits on your wrist, it opens possibilities to partner with other health tech startups that can notify patients when they are having mental health issues before they even recognize it (e.g. mindstrong); or when they should get treatment for hypertension or sleep apnea (e.g. cardiogram); or leverage their data into a digital chronic disease treatment program (e.g. omada health).” apple partners with aetna to launch health app leveraging apple watch data aetna isn’t the first insurer to tie apple watch data to their policies. in september 2018, john hancock launched the vitality program, which also gave users discounts on the latest apple watch if they linked it with john hancock’s app. the company also gave out rewards if users changed their behavior around diet and exercise. in a study conducted by rand europe of 400,000 people in the u.s., the u.k. and south africa, research showed that users who wore an apple watch and participated in the vitality benefits program averaged a 34 percent increase in physical activity compared to patients without the apple watch. it equated to roughly 5 extra days of working out per month. “[it will] be interesting to see how the cvs/apple deal unfolds. personalized health guidance based on a combination of individual medical records and real-time wearable data is a huge and worthy goal,” wrote greg yap, a partner at the venture capital firm, menlo ventures . but, yap wrote, “i’m skeptical their first generation app will have enough data or training to deliver value to a broad population, but we’re likely to see some anecdotal benefits, and i find that worthwhile.” meanwhile, the types of devices that record consumer health information are proliferating — thanks in no small part to verily. with the company reportedly working to co-develop shoes with sensors that monitor users’ movement and weight, according to cnbc, verily is expanding its portfolio of connected devices for health monitoring and management. the company already has a watch that monitors certain patient data — including an fda-approved electrocardiogram — and is developing technologies to track diabetes-related eye disease in patients alongside smart lenses for cataract recovery. it’s part of a broader push from technology companies to tie themselves closer to consumer health as they look to seize a part of the nearly $3 trillion healthcare industry. if more data can be collected from wearable devices (or consumer behavior) and then monitored in a consistent fashion, tech companies ideally could suggest interventions faster and provide lower-cost treatments to help avoid the need for urgent or emergency care. these “top of the funnel” communications and monitoring services from tech companies could conceivably divert users and future healthcare patients into an alternative system that is potentially lower-cost, with more of a focus on outcomes than on the volume of care and number of treatments prescribed. not all physicians are convinced that the use of persistent monitoring will result in better care. dr. john ioannidis, a celebrated professor from stanford university, is skeptical about the utility of monitoring without a better understanding of what the data actually reveals. “information is good for you provided you know what it means. for much of that information we have no clue what it means. we have absolutely no idea what to do with it other than creating more anxiety,” dr. ioannidis said. the goal is to provide personalized guidance where machine learning can be used to identify problems and come up in concert with established therapeutic practices, according to investors who back life sciences startups. “i think startups like omada, livongo, lark, vida, virta, and others, can work and are already working on this overall vision of combining real time and personal historical data to deliver personalized guidance. but to be successful, startups need to be more narrowly focused and deliver improved outcomes and financial benefits right away,” according to yap."
"hello and welcome back to equity, techcrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. february is now behind us, but we gathered the troops to send it off in style: connie loizos was here, kate clark was in, i was around and nea’s jonathan golden joined us, as well. it was good to have a full contingent on hand, as there was a lot to get through: thirdlove raises $55 million: direct-to-consumer undergarment company thirdlove raised a huge round this week, picking up $55 million on top of the roughly $13 million it had raised before. the company is well-known for having a plethora of sizes for bodies of all types. the company’s round was one of four from women-led businesses that we wanted to highlight this week. dipsea raises $5.5 million: dipsea just launched, but it’s launching out the gate with $5.5 million in capital. the company’s subscription app ($8.99 per month, or yearly at a discount) provides short-form audio erotica aimed at the women in the market. the company is female-founded and fits into a recent trend we’ve seen of audio content picking up new money as the genre’s listening base expands during this, the second golden era of podcasting. rockets of awesome raises $19.5 million: our third woman-led startup that picked up capital this week is rockets of awesome, which sells to parents subscription-based clothing for kids. the new round contains a strong infusion of money from foot locker, a brand that we’re all aware of. notably, rockets of awesome intends to dip its toe into the physical realm with its new money. coterie raises $2.75 million: wrapping up our list of women-led companies that have raised this week, coterie raised a smaller round to help fuel its instagram-ready-party-in-a-box business. sadly i didn’t get to mock instagram during the show, but we did get to learn all about what a “friendaversary” is. wrapping the topic on women in venture, and women founding and running startups, we looked at a few data points here, and here. summary: there’s more work to do. motif raises $90 million: returning to our running look at companies that have raised outsized rounds, motif, a spinout, raised a $90 million series a. i wanted to know if we can call such a thing a series a, and jonathan told me to stop being such a square. uber versus lyft: closing out, we wanted to call ourselves out for being wrong about uber and lyft not taking shots at one another this close to their ipos via discounts. they are, indeed, back on their bullshit. all that and february is behind us. here’s to march and what’s next. equity drops every friday at 6:00 am pt, so subscribe to us on apple podcasts, overcast, pocket casts, downcast and all the casts."
"many things are better said than read, but the best voice tech out there seems to be reserved for virtual assistants, not screen readers or automatically generated audiobooks. wellsaid wants to enable any creator to use quality synthetic speech instead of a human voice — perhaps even a synthetic version of themselves. there’s been a series of major advances in voice synthesis over the last couple of years as neural network technology improves on the old highly manual approach. but google, apple and amazon seem unwilling to make their great voice tech available for anything but chirps from your phone or home hub. as soon as i heard about wavenet, and later tacotron, i tried to contact the team at google to ask when they’d get to work producing natural-sounding audiobooks for everything on google books, or as a part of amp, or make it an accessibility service, and so on. never heard back. i considered this a lost opportunity, as there are many out there who need such a service. so i was pleased to hear that wellsaid is taking on this market, after a fashion, anyway. the company is the first to launch from the allen institute for ai (ai2) incubator program announced back in 2017. they do take their time! allen-backed ai2 incubator aims to connect ai startups with world-class talent talk the talk i talked with the co-founders ceo matt hocking and cto michael petrochuk, who explained why they went about creating a whole new system for voice synthesis. the basic problem, they said, is that existing systems not only rely on a lot of human annotation to sound right, but they “sound right” the exact same way every time. you can’t just feed it a few hours of audio and hope it figures out how to inflect questions or pause between list items — much of this stuff has to be spelled out for them. the end result, however, is highly efficient. “their goal is to make a small model for cheap [i.e. computationally] that pronounces things the same way every time. it’s this one perfect voice,” said petrochuk. “we took research like tacotron and pushed it even further — but we’re not trying to control speech and enforce this arbitrary structure on it.” “when you think about the human voice, what makes it natural, kind of, is the inconsistencies,” said hocking. and where better to find inconsistencies than in humans? the team worked with a handful of voice actors to record dozens of hours of audio to feed to the system. there’s no need to annotate the text with “speech markup language” to designate parts of sentences and so on, petrochuk said: “we discovered how to train off of raw audiobook data, without having to do anything on top of that.” so wellsaid’s model will often pronounce the same word differently, not because a carefully manicured manual model of language suggested it do so, but because the person whose vocal fingerprint it is imitating did so. and how does that work, exactly? that question seems to dip into wellsaid’s secret sauce. their model, like any deep learning system, is taking innumerable inputs into account and producing an output, but it is larger and more far-reaching than other voice synthesis systems. things like cadence and pronunciation aren’t specified by its overseers but extracted from the audio and modeled in real time. sounds a bit like magic, but that’s often the case when it comes to bleeding-edge ai research. it runs on a cpu in real time, not on a gpu cluster somewhere, so it can be done offline as well. this is a feat in itself, as many voice synthesis algorithms are quite resource-heavy. what matters is that the voice produced can speak any text in a very natural-sounding way. here’s the first bit of an article — alas, not one of mine, which would have employed more mellifluous circumlocutions — read by google’s wavenet, then by two of wellsaid’s voices. the latter two are definitely more natural sounding than the first. on some phrases the voices may be nearly indistinguishable from their originals, but in most cases i feel sure i could pick out the synthetic voice in a few words. that it’s even close, however, is an accomplishment. and i can certainly say that if i was going to have an article read to my by one of these voices, it would be wellsaid’s. naturally it can also be tweaked and iterated, or effects applied to further manipulate the sound, as with any voice performance. you didn’t think those interviews you hear on npr are unedited, did you? the goal at first is to find the creatives whose work would be improved or eased by adding this tool to their toolbox. “there are a lot of people who have this need,” explained hocking. “a video producer who doesn’t have the budget to hire a voice actor; someone with a large volume of content that has to be iterated on rapidly; if english is a second language, this opens up a lot of doors; and some people just don’t have a voice for radio.” it would be nice to be able to add voice with a click rather than just have block text and royalty-free music over a social ad (think the admen): i asked about the reception among voice actors, who of course are essentially being asked to train their own replacements. they said that the actors were actually positive about it, thinking of it as something like stock photography for voice; get a premade product for cheap, and if you like it, pay the creator for the real thing. although they didn’t want to prematurely lock themselves into future business models, they did acknowledge that revenue share with voice actors was a possibility. payment for virtual representations is something of a new and evolving field. a closed beta launches today, which you can sign up for at the company’s site. they’re going to be launching with five voices to start, with more voices and options to come as wellsaid’s place in the market becomes clear. part of that process will almost certainly be inclusion in tools used by the blind or otherwise disabled, as i have been hoping for years. sounds familiar and what comes after that? making synthetic versions of users’ voices, of course. no brainer! but the two founders cautioned that’s a ways off for several reasons, even though it’s very much a possibility. “right now we’re using about 20 hours of data per person, but we see a future where we can get it down to one or two hours while maintaining a premium lifelike quality to the voice,” said petrochuk. “and we can build off existing data sets, like where someone has a back catalog of content,” added hocking. the trouble is that the content may not be exactly right for training the deep learning model, which advanced as it is can no doubt be finicky. there are dials and knobs to tweak, of course, but they said that fine-tuning a voice is more a matter of adding corrective speech, perhaps having the voice actor reading a specific script that props up the sounds or cadences that need a boost. they compared it with directing such an actor rather than adjusting code. you don’t, after all, tell an actor to increase the pauses after commas by 8 percent or 15 milliseconds, whichever is longer. it’s more efficient to demonstrate for them: “say it like this.” even so, getting the quality just right with limited and imperfect training data is a challenge that will take some serious work if and when the team decides to take it on. but as some of you may have noticed, there are also some parallels to the unsavory world of “deepfakes.” download a dozen podcasts or speeches and you’ve got enough material to make a passable replica of someone’s voice, perhaps a public figure. this of course has a worrying synergy with the existing ability to fake video and other imagery. this is not news to hocking and petrochuk. if you work in ai, this kind of thing is sort of inevitable. “this is a super important question and we’ve considered it a lot,” said petrochuk. “we come from ai2, where the motto is ‘ai for the common good.’ that’s something we really subscribe to, and that differentiates us from our competitors who made barack obama voices before they even had an mvp [minimum viable product]. we’re going to watch closely to make sure this isn’t being used negatively, and we’re not launching with the ability to make a custom voice, because that would let anyone create a voice from anyone.” active monitoring is just about all anyone with a potentially troubling ai technology can be expected to do — though they are looking at mitigation techniques that could help identify synthetic voices. with the ongoing emphasis on multimedia presentation of content and advertising rather than written, wellsaid seems poised to make an early play in a growing market. as the product evolves and improves, it’s easy to picture it moving into new, more constrained spaces, like time-shifting apps (instant podcast with five voices to choose from!) and even taking over territory currently claimed by voice assistants. sounds good to me."
"mark zuckerberg says it might be right for facebook to let people pay to not see ads, but that it would feel wrong to charge users for extra privacy controls. that’s just one of the fascinating philosophical views the ceo shared during the first of his public talks he’s promised as part of his 2019 personal challenge. talking to harvard law and computer science professor jonathan zittrain on the campus of the university he dropped out of, zuckerberg managed to escape the 100-minute conversation with just a few gaffes. at one point he said “we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations”. zittrain swiftly reminded him that’s exactly what facebook portal is, and zuckerberg tried to deflect by saying portal’s recordings would be encrypted. later zuckerberg mentioned “the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see” which is pretty sad and derisive assessment of the personal photos and status updates people share. and when he suggested crowdsourced fact-checking, zittrain chimed in that this could become an avenue for “astroturfing” where mobs of users provide purposefully biased information to promote their interests, like a political group’s supporting voting that their opponents’ facts are lies. while sometimes avoiding hard stances on questions, zuckerberg was otherwise relatively logical and coherent. policy and cooperating with governments the ceo touched on his borderline content policy that quietly demotes posts that come close to breaking its policy against nudity, hate speech etc that otherwise are the most sensational and get the most distribution but don’t make people feel good. zuckerberg noted some progress here, saying “a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that.” this aligns with zuckerberg contemplating facebook’s role as a “data fiduciary” where rather than necessarily giving in to users’ urges or prioritizing its short-term share price, the company tries to do what’s in the best long-term interest of its communities. “there’s a hard balance here which is — i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want” he said. essentially, people might tap on clickbait even if it doesn’t make them feel good. on working with governments, zuckerberg explained how incentives weren’t always aligned, like when law enforcement is monitoring someone accidentally dropping clues about their crimes and collaborators. the government and society might benefit from that continued surveillance but facebook might want to immediately suspend the account if it found out. “but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, ‘hey, this is where we’re at'”, implying facebook might purposefully allow that person to keep incriminating themselves to assist the authorities. but disagreements between governments can flare up, zuckerberg notes that “we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted.” that’s likely a reference to the 2016 arrest of facebook’s vp for latin amercia diego dzodan over whatsapp’s encryption preventing the company from providing evidence for a drug case. decentralizing facebook the tradeoffs of encryption and decentralization were a central theme. he discussed how while many people fear how encryption could mask illegal or offensive activity, facebook doesn’t have to peek at someone’s actual content to determine they’re violating policy. “one of the — i guess, somewhat surprising to me — findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content” zuckerberg said. with facebook rapidly building out a blockchain team to potentially launch a cryptocurrency for fee-less payments or an identity layer for decentralized applications, zittrain asked about the potential for letting users control which other apps they give their profile information to without facebook as an intermediary. san jose, ca – may 01: facebook ceo mark zuckerberg (photo by justin sullivan/getty images) zuckerberg stressed that at facebook’s scale, moving to a less efficient distributed architecture would be extremely “computationally intense” though it might eventually be possible. instead, he said “one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed.” this might be attractive to developers who would know facebook couldn’t cut them off from the users. the problem is that if a developer was abusing users, zuckerberg fears that “in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution?” no “pay for privacy” but perhaps most novel and urgent were zuckerberg’s comments on the secondary questions raised by where facebook should let people pay to remove ads. “you start getting into a principle question which is ‘are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people?’ and my answer to that is a hard no.” facebook has promised to always operate free version so everyone can have a voice. yet some including myself have suggested that a premium ad-free subscription to facebook could help ween it off maximizing data collection and engagement, though it might break facebook’s revenue machine by pulling the most affluent and desired users out of the ad targeting pool. “what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle” zuckerberg expands. “it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong.” back in may, zuckerberg announced facebook would build a clear history button in 2018 that deletes all the web browsing data the social network has collected about you, but that data’s deep integration into the company’s systems has delayed the launch. research suggests users don’t want the inconvenience of getting logged out of all their facebook connected services, though, they’d like to hide certain data from the company. “clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay.” of all the apologies, promises, and predictions zuckerberg has made recently, this pledge might instill the most confidence. while some might think of zuckerberg as a data tyrant out to absorb and exploit as much of our personal info as possible, there are at least lines he’s not willing to cross. facebook could try to charge you for privacy, but it won’t. and given facebook’s dominance in social networking and messaging plus zuckerberg’s voting control of the company, a greedier man could make the internet much worse. — transcript – mark zuckerberg at harvard / first personal challenge 2019 jonathan zittrain: very good. so, thank you, mark, for coming to talk to me and to our students from the techtopia program and from my “internet and society” course at harvard law school. we’re really pleased to have a chance to talk about any number of issues and we should just dive right in. so, privacy, autonomy, and information fiduciaries. mark zuckerberg: all right! jonathan zittrain: love to talk about that. mark zuckerberg: yeah! i read your piece in the new york times. jonathan zittrain: the one with the headline that said, “mark zuckerberg can fix this mess”? mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: although that was last year. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: that’s true! are you suggesting it’s all fixed? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no. no. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: okay, good. so– jonathan zittrain: i’m suggesting that i’m curious whether you still think that we can fix this mess? jonathan zittrain: ah! <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i hope– <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “hope springs eternal”– mark zuckerberg: yeah, there you go. jonathan zittrain: –is my motto. so, all right, let me give a quick characterization of this idea that the coinage and the scaffolding for it is from my colleague, jack balkin, at yale. and the two of us have been developing it out further. there are a standard number of privacy questions with which you might have some familiarity, having to do with people conveying information that they know they’re conveying or they’re not so sure they are, but “mouse droppings” as we used to call them when they run in the rafters of the internet and leave traces. and then the standard way of talking about that is you want to make sure that that stuff doesn’t go where you don’t want it to go. and we call that “informational privacy”. we don’t want people to know stuff that we want maybe our friends only to know. and on a place like facebook, you’re supposed to be able to tweak your settings and say, “give them to this and not to that.” but there’s also ways in which stuff that we share with consent could still sort of be used against us and it feels like, “well, you consented,” may not end the discussion. and the analogy that my colleague jack brought to bear was one of a doctor and a patient or a lawyer and a client or– sometimes in america, but not always– a financial advisor and a client that says that those professionals have certain expertise, they get trusted with all sorts of sensitive information from their clients and patients and, so, they have an extra duty to act in the interests of those clients even if their own interests conflict. and, so, maybe just one quick hypo to get us started. i wrote a piece in 2014, that maybe you read, that was a hypothetical about elections in which it said, “just hypothetically, imagine that facebook had a view about which candidate should win and they reminded people likely to vote for the favored candidate that it was election day,” and to others they simply sent a cat photo. would that be wrong? and i find– i have no idea if it’s illegal; it does seem wrong to me and it might be that the fiduciary approach captures what makes it wrong. mark zuckerberg: all right. so, i think we could probably spend the whole next hour just talking about that! <laughter> mark zuckerberg: so, i read your op-ed and i also read balkin’s blogpost on information fiduciaries. and i’ve had a conversation with him, too. jonathan zittrain: great. mark zuckerberg: and the– at first blush, kind of reading through this, my reaction is there’s a lot here that makes sense. right? the idea of us having a fiduciary relationship with the people who use our services is kind of intuitively– it’s how we think about how we’re building what we’re building. so, reading through this, it’s like, all right, you know, a lot of people seem to have this mistaken notion that when we’re putting together news feed and doing ranking that we have a team of people who are focused on maximizing the time that people spend, but that’s not the goal that we give them. we tell people on the team, “produce the service–” that we think is going to be the highest quality that– we try to ground it in kind of getting people to come in and tell us, right, of the content that we could potentially show what is going to be– they tell us what they want to see, then we build models that kind of– that can predict that, and build that service. jonathan zittrain: and, by the way, was that always the case or– mark zuckerberg: no. jonathan zittrain: –was that a place you got to through some course adjustments? mark zuckerberg: through course adjustments. i mean, you start off using simpler signals like what people are clicking on in feed, but then you pretty quickly learn, “hey, that gets you to local optimum,” right? where if you’re focusing on what people click on and predicting what people click on, then you select for click bait. right? so, pretty quickly you realize from real feedback, from real people, that’s not actually what people want. you’re not going to build the best service by doing that. so, you bring in people and actually have these panels of– we call it “getting to ground truth”– of you show people all the candidates for what can be shown to them and you have people say, “what’s the most meaningful thing that i wish that this system were showing us? so, all this is kind of a way of saying that our own self image of ourselves and what we’re doing is that we’re acting as fiduciaries and trying to build the best services for people. where i think that this ends up getting interesting is then the question of who gets to decide in the legal sense or the policy sense of what’s in people’s best interest? right? so, we come in every day and think, “hey, we’re building a service where we’re ranking newsfeed trying to show people the most relevant content with an assumption that’s backed by data; that, in general, people want us to show them the most relevant content. but, at some level, you could ask the question which is “who gets to decide that ranking newsfeed or showing relevant ads?” or any of the other things that we choose to work on are actually in people’s interest. and we’re doing the best that we can to try to build the services [ph?] that we think are the best. at the end of the day, a lot of this is grounded in “people choose to use it.” right? because, clearly, they’re getting some value from it. but then there are all these questions like you say about, you have– about where people can effectively give consent and not. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: so, i think that there’s a lot of interesting questions in this to unpack about how you’d implement a model like that. but, at a high level i think, you know, one of the things that i think about in terms of we’re running this big company; it’s important in society that people trust the institutions of society. clearly, i think we’re in a position now where people rightly have a lot of questions about big internet companies, facebook in particular, and i do think getting to a point there there’s the right regulation and rules in place just provides a kind of societal guardrail framework where people can have confidence that, okay, these companies are operating within a framework that we’ve all agreed. that’s better than them just doing whatever they want. and i think that that would give people confidence. so, figuring out what that framework is, i think, is a really important thing. and i’m sure we’ll talk about that as it relates– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –to a lot of the content areas today. but getting to that question of how do you– “who determines what’s in people’s best interest, if not people themselves?”jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –is a really interesting question. jonathan zittrain: yes, so, we should surely talk about that. so, on our agenda is the “who decides?” question. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: other agenda items include– just as you say, the fiduciary framework sounds nice to you– doctors, patients, facebook users. and i hear you saying that’s pretty much where you’re wanting to end up anyway. there are some interesting questions about what people want, versus what they want to want. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: people will say “on january 1st, what i want–” new year’s resolution– “is a gym membership.” and then on january 2nd, they don’t want to go to the gym. they want to want to go to the gym, but they never quite make it. and then, of course, a business model of pay for the whole year ahead of time and they know you’ll never turn up develops around that. and i guess a specific area to delve into for a moment on that might be on the advertising side of things, maybe the dichotomy between personalization and does it ever going into exploitation? now, there might be stuff– i know facebook, for example, bans payday loans as best it can. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that’s just a substantive area that it’s like, “all right, we don’t want to do that.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: but when we think about good personalization so that facebook knows i have a dog and not a cat, and a targeter can then offer me dog food and not cat food. how about, if not now, a future day in which an advertising platform can offer to an ad targeter some sense of “i just lost my pet, i’m really upset, i’m ready to make some snap decisions that i might regret later, but when i make them–“ mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: “–i’m going to make them.” so, this is the perfect time to tee up mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –a cubic zirconia or whatever the thing is that– . mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: that seems to me a fiduciary approach would say, ideally– how we get there i don’t know, but ideally we wouldn’t permit that kind of approach to somebody using the information we’ve gleaned from them to know they’re in a tough spot– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and then to exploit them. but i don’t know. i don’t know how you would think about something like that. could you write an algorithm to detect something like that? mark zuckerberg: well, i think one of the key principles is that we’re trying to run this company for the long term. and i think that people think that a lot of things that– if you were just trying to optimize the profits for next quarter or something like that, you might want to do things that people might like in the near term, but over the long term will come to resent. but if you actually care about building a community and achieving this mission and building the company for the long term, i think you’re just much more aligned than people often think companies are. and it gets back to the idea before, where i think our self image is largely acting as– in this kind of fiduciary relationship as you’re saying– and across– we could probably go through a lot of different examples. i mean, we don’t want to show people content that they’re going to click on and engage with, but then feel like they wasted their time afterwards. where we don’t want to show them things that they’re going to make a decision based off of that and then regret later. i mean, there’s a hard balance here which is– i mean if you’re talking about what people want to want versus what they want– you know, often people’s revealed preferences of what they actually do shows a deeper sense of what they want than what they think they want to want. so, i think there’s a question between when something is exploitative versus when something is real, but isn’t what you would say that you want. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s a really hard thing to get at. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but on a lot of these cases my experience of running the company is that you start off building a system, you have relatively unsophisticated signals to start, and you build up increasingly complex models over time that try to take into account more of what people care about. and there are all these examples that we can go through. i think probably newsfeed and ads are probably the two most complex ranking examples– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –that we have. but it’s– like we were talking about a second ago, when we started off with the systems, i mean, just start with newsfeeds– but you could do this on ads, too– you know, the most naïve signals, right, are what people click on or what people “like”. but then you just very quickly realize that that doesn’t– it approximates something, but it’s a very crude approximation of the ground truth of what people actually care about. so, what you really want to get to is as much as possible getting real people to look at the real candidates for content and tell you in a multi-dimensional way what matters to them and try to build systems that model that. and then you want to be kind of conservative on preventing downside. so, your example of the payday loans– and when we’ve talked about this in the past, your– you’ve put the question to me of “how do you know when a payday loan is going to be exploitative?” right? “if you’re targeting someone who is in a bad situation?” and our answer is, “well, we don’t really know when it’s going to be exploitative, but we think that the whole category potentially has a massive risk of that, so we just ban it– jonathan zittrain: right. which makes it an easy case. mark zuckerberg: yes. and i think that the harder cases are when there’s significant upside and significant downside and you want to weigh both of them. so, i mean, for example, once we started putting together a really big effort on preventing election interference, one of the initial ideas that came up was “why don’t we just ban all ads that relate to anything that is political?” and they you pretty quickly get into, all right, well, what’s a political ad? the classic legal definition is things that are around elections and candidates, but that’s not actually what russia and other folks were primarily doing. right? it’s– you know, a lot of the issues that we’ve seen are around issue ads, right, and basically sewing division on what are social issues. so, all right, i don’t think you’re going to get in the way of people’s speech and ability to promote and do advocacy on issues that they care about. so, then the question is “all right, well, so, then what’s the right balance?” of how do you make sure that you’re providing the right level of controls, that people who aren’t supposed to be participating in these debates aren’t or that at least you’re providing the right transparency. but i think we’ve veered a little bit from the original questionjonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –but the– but, yeah. so, let’s get back to where you were jonathan zittrain: well, here’s– and this is a way of maybe moving it forward, which is: a platform as complete as facebook is these days offers lots of opportunities to shape what people see and possibly to help them with those nudges, that it’s time to go to the gym or to avoid them from falling into the depredations of the payday loan. and it is a question of so long as the platform to do it, does it now have an ethical obligation to do it, to help people achieve the good life? mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and i worry that it is too great a burden for any company to bear to have to figure out, say, if not the perfect, the most reasonable newsfeed for every one of the– how many? two and a half billion active users? something like that. mark zuckerberg: yeah. on that order. jonathan zittrain: all the time and there might be some ways that start a little bit to get into the engineering of the thing that would say, “okay, with all hindsight, are there ways to architect this so that the stakes aren’t as high, aren’t as focused on just, “gosh, is facebook doing this right?” it’s as if there was only one newspaper in the whole world or one or two, and it’s like, “well, then what the new york times chooses to put on it’s home page, if it were the only newspaper, would have outsize importance.” mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: so, just as a technical matter, a number of the students in this room had a chance to hear from tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, and he has a new idea for something called “solid”. i don’t know if you’ve heard of solid. it’s a protocol more than it is a product. so, there’s no car to move off the lot today. but its idea is allowing people to have the data that they generate as they motor around the web end up in their own kind of data locker. now, for somebody like tim, it might mean literally in a locker under his desk and he could wake up in the middle of the night and see where his data is. for others, it might mean iraq somewhere, guarded perhaps by a fiduciary who’s looking out for them, the way that we put money in a bank and then we can sleep at night knowing the bankers are– this is maybe not the best analogy in 2019, but watching. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’ll get there. jonathan zittrain: we’ll get there. but solid says if you did that, people would then– or their helpful proxies– be able to say, “all right, facebook is coming along. it wants the following data from me and including that data that it has generated about me as i use it, but stored back in my locker and it kind of has to come back to my well to draw water each time. and that way if i want to switch to schmacebook or something, it’s still in my well and i can just immediately grant permission to schmacebook to see it and i don’t have to do a kind of data slurp and then re-upload it. it’s a fully distributed way of thinking about data. and i’m curious from an engineering perspective does this seem doable with something of the size and the number of spinning wheels that facebook has and does it seem like a mark zuckerberg: yeah– jonathan zittrain: –and i’m curious your reaction to an idea like that. mark zuckerberg: so, i think it’s quite interesting. certainly, the level of computation that facebook is doing and all the services that we’re building is really intense to do in a distributed way. i mean, i think as a basic model i think we’re building out the data center capacity over the next five years and our plan for what we think we need to do that we think is on the order of all of what aws and google cloud are doing for supporting all of their customers. so, okay, so, this is like a relatively computationally intense thing. over time you assume you’ll get more compute. so, decentralized things which are less efficient computationally will be harder– sorry, they’re harder to do computation on, but eventually maybe you have the compute resources to do that. i think the more interesting questions there are not feasibility in the near term, but are the philosophical questions of the goodness of a system like that. so, one question if you want to– so, we can get into decentralization, one of the things that i’ve been thinking about a lot is a use of blockchain that i am potentially interesting in– although i haven’t figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and bringing– and basically granting access to your information and to different services. so, basically, replacing the notion of what we have with facebook connect with something that’s fully distributed. jonathan zittrain: “do you want to login with your facebook account?” is the status quo mark zuckerberg: basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice of whether to login to different places and you’re not going through an intermediary, which is kind of like what you’re suggesting here– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –in a sense. okay, now, there’s a lot of things that i think would be quite attractive about that. you know, for developers one of the things that is really troubling about working with our system, or google’s system for that matter, or having your services through apple’s app store, is that you don’t want to have an intermediary between serving your– the people who are using your service and you, right, where someone can just say, “hey, we as a developer have to follow your policy and if we don’t, then you can cut off access to the people we’re serving.” that’s kind of a difficult and troubling position to be in. i think developers– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: –you’re referring to a recent incident. mark zuckerberg: no, well, i was– well, sure<laughter> mark zuckerberg: but i think it underscores the– i think every developer probably feels this: people are using any app store but also login with facebook, with google; any of these services, you want a direct relationship with the people you serve. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: now, okay, but let’s look at the flip side. so, what we saw in the last couple of years with cambridge analytica, was basically an example where people chose to take data that they– some of it was their data, some of it was data that they had seen from their friends, right? because if you want to do things like making it so alternative services can build a competing newsfeed, then you need to be able to make it so that people can bring the data that they see you [ph?] within the system. okay, theybasically, people chose to give their data to a developer who’s affiliated with cambridge university, which is a really respected institution, and then that developer turned around and sold the data to the firm cambridge analytica, which is in violation of our policies. so, we cut off the developers’ access. and, of course, in a fully distributed system there would be no one who could cut off the developers’ access. so, the question is if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on the one hand, but it really raises the stakes and it gets to your questions around, well, what are the boundaries on consent and how people can really actually effectively know that they’re giving consent to an institution? in some ways it’s a lot easier to regulate and hold accountable large companies like facebook or google, because they’re more visible, they’re more transparent than the long tail of services that people would chose to then go interact with directly. so, i think that this is a really interesting social question. to some degree i think this idea of going in the direction of blockchain authentication is less gated on the technology and capacity to do that. i think if you were doing fully decentralized facebook, that would take massive computation, but i’m sure we could do fully decentralized authentication if we wanted to. i think the real question is do you really want that? jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: right? and i think you’d have more cases where, yes, people would be able to not have an intermediary, but you’d also have more cases of abuse and the recourse would be much harder. jonathan zittrain: yes. what i hear you saying is people as they go about their business online are generating data about themselves that’s quite valuable, if not to themselves, to others who might interact with them. and the more they are empowered, possibly through a distributed system, to decide where that data goes, with whom they want to share it, the more they could be exposed to exploitation. this is a genuine dilemma– mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –because i’m a huge fan of decentralization. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: but i also see the problem. and maybe one answer is there’s some data that’s just so toxic there’s no vessel we should put it in; it might eat a whole through it or something, metaphorically speaking. but, then again, innocuous data can so quickly be assembled into something scary. so, i don’t know if the next election– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: yeah. [ph?] i mean, i think in general we’re talking about the large-scale of data being assembled into meaning something different from what the individual data points mean. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that’s the whole challenge here. but i philosophically agree with you thati mean, i want to think about the– like, i do think about the work that we’re doing as a decentralizing force in the world, right? a lot of the reason why i think people of my generation got into technology is because we believe that technology gives individuals power and isn’t massively centralizing. now you’ve built a bunch of big companies in the process, but i think what has largely happened is that individuals today have more voice, more ability to affiliate with who they want, and stay connected with people, ability to form communities in ways that they couldn’t before, and i think that’s massively empowering to individuals and that’s philosophically kind of the side that i tend to be on. so, that’s why i’m thinking about going back to decentralized or blockchain authentication. that’s why i’m kind of bouncing around how could you potentially make this work, because from my orientation is to try to go in that direction. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: an example where i think we’re generally a lot closer to going in that direction is encryption. i mean, this is, like, one of the really big debates today is basically what are the boundaries on where you would want a messaging service to be encrypted. and there are all these benefits from a privacy and security perspective, but, on the other hand, if what we’re trying to do– one of the big issues that we’re grappling with content governance and where is the line between free expression and, i suppose, privacy on one side, but safety on the other as people do really bad things, right, some of the time. and i think people rightfully have an expectation of us that we’re going to do everything we can to stop terrorists from recruiting people or people from exploiting children or doing different things. and moving in the direction of making these systems more encrypted certainly reduces some of the signals that we would have access to be able to do some of that really important work. but here we are, right, we’re sitting in this position where we’re running whatsapp, which is the largest end-to-end encrypting service in the world; we’re running messenger, which is another one of the largest messaging systems in the world where encryption is an option, but it isn’t the default. i don’t think long term it really makes sense to be running different systems with very different policies on this. i think this is sort of a philosophical question where you want to figure out where you want to be on it. and, so, my question for you– now, i’ll talk about how i’m thinking about this– is all right, if you were in my position and you got to flip a switch is probably too glib, because there’s a lot of work that goes into this, and go in one direction for both of those services, who would you think about that? jonathan zittrain: well, the question you’re putting on the table, which is a hard one is “is it okay,” and let’s just take the simple case, “for two people to communicate with each other in a way that makes it difficult for any third party to casually listen in?” is that okay? and i think that the way we normally answer that question is kind of a form of what you might call status quo-ism, which is not satisfying. it’s whatever has been the case is— mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. jonathan zittrain: –whatever has been the case is what should stay the case. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and, so, for whatsapp, it’s like right now whatsapp, as i understand it, you could correct me if i’m wrong, is pretty hard to get into if– mark zuckerberg: it’s fully end-to-end encrypted. jonathan zittrain: right. so, if facebook gets handed a subpoena or a warrant or something from name-your-favorite-country– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: –and you’re just like, “thank you for playing. we have nothing to–” <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, we’ve had employees thrown in jail because we have gotten court orders that we have to turnover data that we wouldn’t probably anyway, but we can’t because it’s encrypted. jonathan zittrain: yes. and then, on the other hand, and this is not as clean as it could be in theory, but messenger is sometimes encrypted, sometimes not. if it doesn’t happen to have been encrypted by the users, then that subpoena could work and, more than that, there could start to be some automated systems either on facebook’s own initiative or under pressure from governments in the general case, not a specific warrant, to say, “hey, if the following phrases appear, if there’s some telltale that says, “this is somebody going after a kid for exploitation,” it should be forwarded up. if that’s already happening and we can produce x-number of people who have been identified and a number of crimes averted that way, who wants to be the person to be like, “lock it down!” like, “we don’t want any more of that!” but i guess, to put myself now to your question, when i look out over years rather than just weeks or months, the ability to casually peek at any conversation going on between two people or among a small group of people or even to have a machine do it for you, so, you can just set your alert list, you know, crudely speaking, and get stuff back, that– it’s always trite to call something orwellian, but it makes orwell look like a piker. i mean, it seems like a classic case where you– the next sentence would be “what could possible go wrong?” jonathan zittrain: and we can fill that in! and it does mean, though, i think that we have to confront the fact that if we choose to allow that kind of communication, then there’s going to be crimes unsolved that could’ve been solved. there’s going to be crimes not prevented that could have been prevented. and the only thing that kind of blunts it a little is it is not really all or nothing. the modern surveillance states of note in the world, have a lot of arrows in their quivers. and just being able to darken you door and demand surveillance of a certain kind, that might be a first thing they would go to, but they’ve got a plan b, and plan c, and a plan d. and i guess it really gets to what’s your threat model? if you think everybody is kind of a threat, think about the battles of copyright 15 years ago. everybody is a potential infringer. all they have to do is fire up napster, then you’re wanting some massive technical infrastructure to prevent the bad thing. if what you’re thinking is instead, they are a few really bad apples and they tend to– when they congregate online or otherwise with one another– tend to identify themselves and then we might have to send somebody near their house to listen with a cup at the window, metaphorically speaking. that’s a different threat model and [sic] might not need it. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: is that getting to an answer to your question? mark zuckerberg: yeah, and i think i generally agree. i mean, i’ve already said publically that my inclination is to move these services in the direction of being all encrypted, at least the private communication version. i basically think if you want to kind of talk in metaphors, messaging is like people’s living room, right? and i think we– you know, we definitely don’t want a society where there’s a camera in everyone’s living room watching the content of those conversations. jonathan zittrain: even as we’re now– i mean, it is 2019, people are happily are putting cameras in their living rooms. mark zuckerberg: that’s their choice, but i guess they’re putting cameras in their living rooms, well, for a number of reasons, but– jonathan zittrain: and facebook has a camera that you can go into your living room- <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that is, i guess– jonathan zittrain: i just want to be clear. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: yeah, although that would be encrypted in this world. jonathan zittrain: encrypted between you and facebook! mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. i think– but it also– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: doesn’t it have like a little alexa functionality, too? mark zuckerberg: well, portal works over messenger. so, if we go towards encryption on messenger, then that’ll be fully encrypted, which i think, frankly, is probably what people want. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: the other model, beside the living room is the town square and that, i think, just has different social norms and different policies and norms that should be at play around that. but i do think that these things are very different. right? you’re not going to– you may end up in a world where the town square is a fully decentralized or fully encrypted thing, but it’s not clear what value there is in encrypting something that’s public content anyway, or very broad. jonathan zittrain: but, now, you were put to it pretty hard in that as i understand it there’s now a change to how whatsapp works, that there’s only five forwards permitted. mark zuckerberg: yeah, so, this is a really interesting point, right? so, when people talk about how encryption will darken some of the signals that we’ll be able to use, you know, both for potentially providing better services and for preventing harm. one of the– i guess, somewhat surprising to me, findings of the last couple of years of working on content governance and enforcement is that it often is much more effective to identify fake accounts and bad actors upstream of them doing something bad by patterns of activity rather than looking at the content. jonathan zittrain: so-called meta data. mark zuckerberg: sure. jonathan zittrain: “i don’t know what they’re saying, but here’s who’s they’re calling” kind of thing. mark zuckerberg: yeah, or just like they– this account doesn’t seem to really act like a person, right? and i guess as ai gets more advanced and you build these adversarial networks or generalized adversarial networks, you’ll get to a place where you have ai that can probably more effectively jonathan zittrain: go under mimic [ph?] cover. mimic act like another person– <overlapping conversation> mark zuckerberg: –for a while. mark zuckerberg: yeah. but, at the same time, you’ll be building up contrary ai on the other side, but is better at identifying ais that are doing that. but this has certainly been the most effective tactic across a lot of the areas where we’ve needed to focus to preventing harm. you know, the ability to identify fake accounts, which, like, a huge amount of the– under any category of issue that you’re talking about, a lot of the issues downstream come from fake accounts or people who are clearly acting in some malicious or not normal way. you can identify a lot of that without necessarily even looking at the content itself. and if you have to look at a piece of content, then in some cases, you’re already late, because the content exists and the activity has already happened. so, that’s one of the things that makes me feel like encryption for these messaging services is really the right direction to go, because you’re– it’s a very proprivacy and per security move to give people that control and assurance and i’m relatively confident that even though you are losing some tools to– on the finding harmful content side of the ledger, i don’t think at the end of the day that those are going to end up being the most important tools jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: –for finding the most of the– <overlapping conversation> jonathan zittrain: but now connect it up quickly to the five forwards thing. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, sure. so, that gets down to if you’re not operating on a piece of content directly, you need to operate on patterns of behavior in the network. and what we, basically found was there weren’t that many good uses for people forwarding things more than five times except to basically spam or blast stuff off. it was being disproportionately abused. so, you end up thinking about different tactics when you’re not operating on content specifically; you end up thinking about patterns of usage more. jonathan zittrain: well, spam, i get and that– i’m always in favor of things that reduce spam. however, you could also say the second category was just to spread content. you could have the classic, i don’t know, like les mis, or paul revere’s ride, or arab spring-esque in the romanticized vision of it: “gosh, this is a way for people to do a tree,” and pass along a message that “you can’t stop the signal,” to use a joss whedon reference. you really want to get the word out. this would obviously stop that, too. mark zuckerberg: yeah, and then i think the question is you’re just weighing whether you want this private communication tool where the vast majority of the use and the reason why it was designed was the vast majority of just one-on-one; there’s a large amount of groups that people communicate into, but it’s a pretty small edge case of people operating this with, like– you have a lot of different groups and you’re trying to organize something and almost hack public content-type or public sharing- type utility into an encrypted space and, again, there i think you start getting into “is this the living room or is this the town square?” and when people start trying to use tools that are designed for one thing to get around what i think the social norms are for the town square, that’s when i think you probably start to have some issues. this is not– we’re not done addressing these issues. there’s a lot more to think through on this jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: –but that’s the general shape of the problem that at least i perceive from the work that we’re doing. jonathan zittrain: well, without any particular segue, let’s talk about fake news. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, insert your favorite segue here. there’s some choice or at least some decision that gets made to figure out what’s going to be next in my newsfeed when i scroll up a little more. mark zuckerberg: mm-hm. jonathan zittrain: and in the last conversation bit, we were talking about how much we’re looking at content versus telltales and metadata, things that surround the content. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for knowing about what that next thing in the newsfeed should be, is it a valid desirable material consideration, do you think, for a platform like facebook to say is the thing we are about to present true, whatever true means? mark zuckerberg: well, yes, because, again, getting at trying to serve people, people tell us that they don’t want fake content. right. i mean, i don’t know anyone who wants fake content. i think the whole issue is, again, who gets to decide. right. so broadly speaking, i don’t know any individual who would sit there and say, “yes, please show me things that you know are false and that are fake.” people want good quality content and information. that said, i don’t really think that people want us to be deciding what is true for them and people disagree on what is true. and, like, truth is, i mean, there are different levels of when someone is telling a story, maybe the meta arc is talking about something that is true but the facts that were used in it are wrong in some nuanced way but, like, it speaks to some deeper experience. well, was that true or not? and do people want that disqualified from to them? i think different people are going to come to different places on this. now, so i’ve been very sensitive, which, on, like, we really want to make sure that we’re showing people high quality content and information. we know that people don’t want false information. so we’re building quite advanced systems to be able to– to make sure that we’re emphasizing and showing stuff that is going to be high quality. but the big question is where do you get the signal on what the quality is? so the kind of initial v.1 of this was working with third party fact checkers. right, i believe very strongly that people do not want facebook and that we should not be the arbiters of truth in deciding what is correct for everyone in the society. i think people already generally think that we have too much power in deciding what content is good. i tend to also be concerned about that and we should talk about some of the governance stuff that we’re working on separately to try to make it so that we can bring more independent oversight into that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but let’s put that in a box for now and just say that with those concerns in mind, i’m definitely not looking to try to take on a lot more in terms of also deciding in addition to enforcing all the content policies, also deciding what is true for everyone in the world. okay, so v.1 of that is we’re going to work with– jonathan zittrain: truth experts. mark zuckerberg: we’re working with fact checkers. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: and, and they’re experts and basically, there’s like a whole field of how you go and assess certain content. they’re accredited. people can disagree with the leaning of some of these organizations. jonathan zittrain: <laughter> who does accredited fact checkers? mark zuckerberg: <laughs> the poynter institute for journalism. jonathan zittrain: i should apply for my certification. mark zuckerberg: you may. jonathan zittrain: okay, good. mark zuckerberg: you’d probably get it, but you have to– you’d have to go through the process. mark zuckerberg: the issue there is there aren’t enough of them, right. so there’s a large content. there’s obviously a lot of information is shared every day and there just aren’t a lot of fact checkers. so then the question is okay, that is probably jonathan zittrain: but the portion– you’re saying the food is good, it’s just the portions are small. but the food is good. mark zuckerberg: i think in general, but so you build systems, which is what we’ve done especially leading up to elections where i think are some of the most fraught times around this where people really are aggressively trying to spread misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: you build systems that prioritize content that seems like it’s going viral because you want to reduce the prevalence of how widespread the stuff gets, so that way the fact checkers have tools to be able to, like, prioritize what they need to go– what they need to go look at. but it’s still getting to a relatively small percent of the content. so i think the real thing that we want to try to get to over time is more of a crowd sourced model where people, it’s not that people are trusting some sort, some basic set of experts who are accredited but are in some kid of lofty institution somewhere else. it’s like do you trust, yeah, like, if you get enough data points from within the community of people reasonably looking at something and assessing it over time, then the question is can you compound that together into something that is a strong enough signal that we can then use that? jonathan zittrain: kind of in the old school like a slash-dot moderating system mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: with only the worry that if the stakes get high enough, somebody wants to astroturf that. mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: i’d be– mark zuckerberg: there are a lot of questions here, which is why i’m not sitting here and announcing a new program. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: but what i’m saying is this is, like,– jonathan zittrain: yeah, mark zuckerberg: this is the general direction that i think we should be thinking about when we haveand i think that there’s a lot of questions and– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and we’d like to run some tests in this area to see whether this can help out. which would be upholding the principles which are that we want to stop– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: the spread of misinformation. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: knowing that no one wants misinformation. and the other principle, which is that we do not want to be arbiters of truth. jonathan zittrain: want to be the decider, yes. mark zuckerberg: and i think that that’s the basic– those are the basic contours i think of that, of that problem. jonathan zittrain: so let me run an idea by you that you can process in real time and tell me the eight reasons i have not thought of why this is a terrible idea. and that would be people see something in their facebook feed. they’re about to share it out because it’s got a kind of outrage factor to it. i think of the classic story from two years ago in the denver guardian about “fbi agent suspected in hilary clinton email leak implicated in murder-suicide.” i have just uttered fake news. none of that was true if you clicked through the denver guardian. there was just that article. there is denver guardian. if you live in denver, you cannot subscribe. like, it is unambiguously fake. and it was shared more times than the most shared story during the election season of the boston globe. and so mark zuckerberg: so, and this is actually an example, by the way, of where trying to figure out fake accounts is a much simpler solution. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: than trying to down– jonathan zittrain: so if newspaper has one article– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: wait for ten more before you decide they’re a newspaper. mark zuckerberg: yeah. or, you know, i mean, it’s there are any number of systems that you could build to basically detect, “hey, this is–” jonathan zittrain: a potemkin. mark zuckerberg: this is a fraudulent thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and then you can take that down. and again, that ends up being a much less controversial decision because you’re doing it upstream based on the basis of inauthenticity. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: in a system where people are supposed to be their real and represent that they’re their real selves than downstream, trying to say, “hey, is this true or false?” jonathan zittrain: i made a mistake in giving you the easy case. mark zuckerberg: okay. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so i should have not used that example. mark zuckerberg: too simple. jonathan zittrain: you’re right and you knocked that one out of the park and, like, denver guardian, come up with more articles and be real and then come back and talk to us. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so, here’s the harder case which is something that might be in an outlet that is, you know, viewed as legitimate, has a number of users, et cetera. so you can’t use the metadata as easily. imagine if somebody as they shared it out could say, “by the way, i want to follow this. i want to learn a little bit more about this.” they click a button that says that. and i also realized when i talked earlier to somebody at facebook on this that adding a new button to the homepage is, like, everybody’s first idea mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah. jonathan zittrain: and it’s– mark zuckerberg: but it’s a reasonable thought experiment, even though it would lead to a very bad ui. jonathan zittrain: fair enough. i understand this is already– mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughs> jonathan zittrain: in the land of fantasy. so they add the button. they say, “i want to follow up on this.” if enough people are clicking comparatively on the same thing to say, “i want to learn more about this. if anything else develops, let me know, facebook,” that, then, if i have my pneumatic tube, it then goes to a convened virtually panel of three librarians. we go to the librarians of the nation and the world at public and private libraries across the land who agree to participate in this program. maybe we set up a little foundation for it that’s endowed permanently and no long connected to whoever endowed it. and those librarians together discuss the piece and they come back with what they would tell a patron if somebody came up to them and said, “i’m about to cite this in my social studies paper. what do you think?” and librarians, like, live for questions like that. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm, yeah. jonathan zittrain: they’re like, “wow. let us tell you.” and they have a huge fiduciary notion of patron duty that says, “i may disapprove of you even studying this, whatever, but i’m here to serve you, the user.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: “and i just think you should know, this is why maybe it’s not such a good source.” and when they come up with that they can send it back and it gets pushed out to everybody who asks for follow-up– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and they can do with it as they will. and last piece of the puzzle, we have high school students who apprentice as librarian number three for credit. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and then they can get graded on how well they participated in this exercise which helps generate a new generation of librarian-themed people who are better off at reading things, so. mark zuckerberg: all right, well, i think you have a side goal here which i haven’t been thinking about on the librarian thing. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: which is the evil goal of promoting libraries. jonathan zittrain: well, it’s mark zuckerberg: no, but i mean, look, i think solving– preventing misinformation or spreading misinformation is hard enough without also trying to develop high school students in a direction. jonathan zittrain: ah. my colleague charlies foote– mark zuckerberg: so, that’s solving a problem with a problem. jonathan zittrain: all right. well, anyway, yes. mark zuckerberg: so i actually think i agree with most of what you have in there. it doesn’t need to be a button on the home page, it can be– i mean, it turns out that there’s so many people using these services that even if you get– even if you put something that looks like it’s not super prominent, like, behind the three dots on a given newsfeed story, you have the options, yeah, you’re not– not everyone is going tois going to like something. jonathan zittrain: if 1 out of 1000 do it, you still get 10,000 or 100,000 people, yeah. mark zuckerberg: you get pretty good signal. but i actually think you could do even better, which is, it’s not even clear that you need that signal. i think that that’s super helpful. i think really what matters is looking at stuff that’s getting a lot of distribution. so, you know, i think that there’s kind of this notion, and i’m going back to the encryption conversation, which is all right, if i say something that’s wrong to you in a one-on-one conversation, i mean, does that need to be fact checked? i mean, it’s, yeah, it would be good if you got the most accurate information. jonathan zittrain: i do have a personal librarian to accompany me for most conversations, yes. there you go. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: well, you are– jonathan zittrain: unusual. mark zuckerberg: yeah, yeah. yes. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: that’s the word i was looking for. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: i’m not sure i believe you, but yes. mark zuckerberg: it’s– <laughs> but i think that there’s limited– i don’t think anyone would say that every message that goes back and forth in especially an encrypted messaging service should be jonathan zittrain: fact checked. mark zuckerberg: should be fact checked. jonathan zittrain: correct. mark zuckerberg: so i think the real question is all right, when something starts going viral or getting a lot of distribution, that’s when it becomes most socially important for it to be– have some level of validation or at least that we know where that the community in general thinks that this is a reasonable thing. so it’s actually, while it’s helpful to have the signal of whether people are flagging this as something that we should look at, i actually think increasingly you want to be designing systems that just prevent like alarming or sensational content from going viral in the first place. and making sure that that, that the stuff that is getting wide distribution is doing so because it’s high quality on whatever front you care about. so then, okay– jonathan zittrain: and that quality is still generally from poynter or some external party that mark zuckerberg: well, well quality has many dimensions. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but certainly accuracy is one dimension of it. you also, i mean, you pointed out i think in one of your questions, is this piece of content prone to incite outrage. if you don’t mind, i’ll get to your panel of three things in a second, but as a slight detour on this. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: one of the findings that has been quite interesting is, you know, there’s this question about whether social media in general increases, basically makes it so that sensationalist content gets the most distribution. and what we’ve found is that, all right, so we’re going to have rules, right, about what content is allowed. and what we found is that generally within whatever rules you set up, as content approaches the line of what is allowed, it often gets more distribution. so if you’ll have some rule on, you know, what– and take a completely different example and our nudity policies. right. it’s like, okay, you have to define what is unacceptable nudity in some way. as you get as close to that as possible it’s like, all right. like, this is maybe a photo of someone– jonathan zittrain: the skin to share ratio goes up until it gets banned at which point it goes to zero. mark zuckerberg: yes. okay. so that is a bad property of a system, right, that i think you want to generally address. or you don’t want to design a community where or systems for helping to build a community where things that get as close to the line as what is bad get the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so long as we have the premise, which in many cases is true, but i could probably try to think of some where it wouldn’t be true, that as you near the line, you are getting worse. mark zuckerberg: that’s a good point. that’s a good point. there’s– jonathan zittrain: you know, there might be humor that’s really edgy. mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: and that conveys a message that would be impossible to convey without the edginess, while not still– mark zuckerberg: that is– jonathan zittrain: but, i– mark zuckerberg: that’s true. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so but then you get the question of what’s the cost benefit of allowing that. and obviously, where you can accurately separate what’s good and bad which you, like in the case of misinformation i’m not sure you could do it fully accurately, but you can try to build systems that approximate that, there’s certainly the issue, which is that, i mean, there is misinformation which leads to massive public harm, right. so if it’s misinformation that is also spreading hate and leading to genocide or public attacks or, it’s like, okay, we’re not going to allow that. right. that’s coming down. but then generally if you say something that’s wrong, we’re not going to try to block that. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: we’re just going to try to not show it to people widely because people don’t want content that is wrong. so then the question is as something is approaching the line, how do you assess that? this is a general theme in a lot of the content governance and enforcement work that we’re doing, which is there’s one piece of this which is just making sure that we can as effectively as possible enforce the policies that exist. then there’s a whole other stream of work, which i called borderline content, which is basically this issue of as content approaches the line of being against the policies, how do you make sure that that isn’t the content that is somehow getting the most distribution? and a lot of the things that we’ve done in the last year were focused on that problem and it really improves the quality of the service and people appreciate that. jonathan zittrain: so this idea would be stuff that you’re kind of letting down easy without banning and letting down easy as it’s going to somehow have a coefficient of friction for sharing that goes up. it’s going to be harder– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: for it to go viral. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and– mark zuckerberg: so it’s fascinating because it’s just against– like, you can take almost any category of policy that we have, so i used nudity a second ago. you know, gore and violent imagery. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: hate speech. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: any of these things. i mean, there’s, like, hate speech, there’s content that you would just say is mean or toxic, but that did not violate– but that you would not want to have a society that banned being able to say that thing. but it’s, but you don’t necessarily want that to be the content that is getting the most distribution. jonathan zittrain: so here’s a classic transparency question around exactly that system you described. and when you described this, i think you did a post around this a few months ago. this was fascinating. you had graphs in the post depicting this, which was great. how would you feel about sharing back to the person who posted or possibly to everybody who encounters it its coefficient of friction? would that freak people out? would it be, like, all right, i– and in fact, they would then probably start conforming their posts, for better or worse,– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: to try to maximize the sharability. but that rating is already somewhere in there by design. would it be okay to surface it? mark zuckerberg: so, as a principle, i think that that would be good, but i don’t– the way that the systems are designed isn’t that you get a score of how inflammatory or sensationalist a piece of content is. the way that it basically works is you can build classifiers that identify specific types of things. right. so we’re going down the list of, like, all right, there’s 20 categories of harmful content that you’re trying to identify. you know, everything from terrorist propaganda on the one hand to self-harm issues to hate speech and election interference. and basically, each of these things while it uses a lot of the same underlying machine learning infrastructure, you’re doing specific work for each of them. so if you go back to the example on nudity for a second, you know, what you– you’re not necessarily scoring everything on a scale of not at all nude to nude. you[‘re basically enforcing specific policies. so, you know, you’re saying, “okay, if–” jonathan zittrain: so by machine learning it would just be give me an estimate of the odds by which if a human looked at it who was employed to enforce policy– mark zuckerberg: well, basically– jonathan zittrain: whether it violates the policy. mark zuckerberg: and you have a sense of, okay, this is– so what are the things that are adjacent to the policy, right? so you night say, okay, well, if the person is completely naked, that is something that you can definitely build a classifier to be able to identify with relatively high accuracy. but even if they’re not, you know, then the question is you kind of need to be able to qualitatively describe what are the things that are adjacent to that. so maybe the person is wearing a bathing suit and is in a sexually suggestive position. right. it’s not like any piece of content you’re going to score from not at all nude to nude. but you kind of have the cases for what you think are adjacent to the issues and, and again, you ground this and qualitatively, people, like, people might click on it, they might engage with it, but at the end, they don’t necessarily feel good about it. and you want to get at when you’re designing these systems not just what people do, but also you want to make sure we factor in, too, like is this the content that people say that they really want to be seeing? do they–? jonathan zittrain: the constitutional law, there’s a formal kind of definition that’s emerged for the word “prurient.” if something appeals to the prurient interest– mark zuckerberg: okay. jonathan zittrain: as part of a definition of obscenity, the famous miller test, which was not a beeroriented test. and part of a prurient interest is basically it excites me and yet it completely disgusts me. and it sounds like you’re actually converging to the supreme court’s vision of prurience with this. mark zuckerberg: maybe. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: and it might be– don’t worry, i’m not trying to nail you down on that. but it’s very interesting that machine learning, which you invoked, is both really good, i gather, at something like this. it’s the kind of thing that’s like just have some people tell me with their expertise, does this come near to violating the policy or not and i’ll just through a spidey sense start to tell you whether it would. mark zuckerberg: mm-hmm. jonathan zittrain: rather than being able to throw out exactly what the factors are. i know the person’s fully clothed, but it still is going to invoke that quality. so all of the benefits of machine learning and all of, of course, all the drawbacks where it classifies something and somebody’s like, “wait a minute. that was me doing a parody of blah, blah, blah.” that all comes to the fore. mark zuckerberg: yeah and i mean, when you ask people what they want to see in addition to looking at what they actually engage with, you do get a completely different sense of what people value and you can build systems that approximate that. but going back to your question, i think rather than giving people a score of the friction– jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i think you can probably give people feedback of, “hey, this might make people uncomfortable in this way, in this specific way.” and this fits your– jonathan zittrain: it might affect how much it gets– how much it gets shared. mark zuckerberg: yeah. and this gets down to a different– there’s a different ai ethics question which i think is really important here, which is designing ai systems to be understandable by people jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: right and to some degree, you don’t just want it to spit out a score of how offensive or, like, where it scores on any given policy. you want it to be able to map to specific things that might be problematic. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: and that’s the way that we’re trying to design the systems overall. jonathan zittrain: yes. now we have something parked in the box we should take out, which is the external review stuff. but before we do, one other just transparency thing maybe to broach. it basically just occurred to me, i imagine it might be possible to issue me a score of how much i’ve earned for facebook this year. it could simply say, “this is how much we collected on the basis of you in particular being exposed to an ad.” <laughs> and i know sometimes people, i guess, might compete to get their numbers up. <laughs> but i’m just curious, would that be a figure? i’d kind of be curious to know, in part because it might even lay the groundwork of being like, “look, mark, i’ll double it. you can have double the money and then don’t show me any ads.” can we get a car off of that lot today? <laughter> mark zuckerberg: <laughs> okay, well, there’s a lot– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: there’s a lot in there. jonathan zittrain: it was a quick question. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> so there’s a question in what you’re saying which is so we built an ad-supported system. should we have an option for people to pay to not see ads. jonathan zittrain: right. mark zuckerberg: i think is kind of what you’re saying. i mean, just as the basic primer from first principles on this. you know, we’re building this service. we want to give everyone a voice. we want everyone to be able to connect with who they care about. if you’re trying to build a service for everyone, jonathan zittrain: got to be free. that’s just <inaudible 01:04:45> mark zuckerberg: if you want them to use it, that’s just going to be the argument. yes, yes. jonathan zittrain: okay. all right. mark zuckerberg: so then, so this is a kind of a tried and true thing. there are a lot of companies over time that have been ad supported. in general what we find is that if people are going to see ads, they want them to be relevant. they don’t want them to be junk. right. so then within that you give people control over how their data is used to show them ads. but the vast majority of people say, like, show me the most relevant ads that you can because i get that i have to see ads. this is a free service. so now the question is, all right, so there’s a whole set of questions around that that we could get into, but but then jonathan zittrain: for which we did talk about enough to reopen it, the personalization exploitation. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: or even just philosophical question. right now, uber or lyft are not funded that way. we could apply this ad model to uber or lyft, “free rides. totally free. it’s just every fifth ride takes you to wendy’s and idles outside the drive through window.” <laughter> jonathan zittrain: “totally up to you what you want to do, but you’re going to sit here for a while,” and then you go on your way. i don’t know how– and status quo-ism would probably say people would have a problem with that, but it would give people rides that otherwise wouldn’t get rides. mark zuckerberg: i have not thought about that case in their– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: in their business, so, so– jonathan zittrain: well, that’s my patent, damn it, so don’t you steal it. mark zuckerberg: but certainly some services, i think tend themselves better towards being ad supported than others. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: okay and i think generally information-based ones tend to– jonathan zittrain: than my false imprisonment hypo, i’d– okay, fair enough. mark zuckerberg: i mean, that seems jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: there might be, you know, more– <laughs> more issues there. but okay, but go to the subscription thing. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: when people have questions about the ad model on facebook, i don’t think the questions are just about the ad model, i think they’re about both seeing ads and data use around ads. and the thing that i think, so when i think about this it’s, i don’t just think you want to let people pay to not see ads because i actually think then the question is the questions are around ads and data use and i don’t think people are going to be that psyched about not seeing ads but then not having different controls over how their data is used. okay, but now you start getting into a principle question which is are we going to let people pay to have different controls on data use than other people. and my answer to that is a hard no, right. so the prerequisite– jonathan zittrain: what’s an example of data use that isn’t ad-based, just so we know what we’re talking about? mark zuckerberg: that isn’t ad-based? jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: like what do you mean? jonathan zittrain: you were saying, i don’t want to see ads. but you’re saying that’s kind of just the wax on the car. what’s underneath is how the data gets used. mark zuckerberg: so, well, look– maybe– let me keep going with this explanation and then i think this’ll be clear. jonathan zittrain: yeah, sure. mark zuckerberg: so one of the things that we’ve been working on is this tool that we call clear history. and the basic idea is it is you can kind of analogize it to a web browser where you can clear your cookies. that’s kind of a normal thing. you know that when you clear your cookies you’re going to get logged out of a bunch of stuff. a bunch of stuff might get more annoying. jonathan zittrain: which is why my guess is, am i right, probably nobody clears their cookies. mark zuckerberg: i don’t know. jonathan zittrain: they might use incognito mode or something, but. mark zuckerberg: i think– i don’t know. how many of you guys clear your cookies every once in a while, right? jonathan zittrain: this is not a representative group, damn it. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. like, maybe once a year or something i’ll clear my cookies. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but no, it’s, i think– jonathan zittrain: happy new year. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, over some period of time, all right, but– jonathan zittrain: yeah, okay. mark zuckerberg: but not necessarily every day. but it’s important that people have that tool even though it might in a local sense make their experience worse. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: okay. so that kind of content of what different services, websites and apps send to facebook that, you know, we use to help measure the ads in effectiveness there, right, so things like, you know, if you’re an app developer and you’re trying to pay for ads to help grow your app, we want to only charge you when we actually, when something that we show leads to an install, not just whether someone sees the ad or clicks on it, but if they add– jonathan zittrain: that requires a whole infrastructure to, yeah. mark zuckerberg: okay, so then, yeah, so you build that out. it helps us show people more relevant ads. it can help show more relevant content. often a lot of these signals are super useful also on the security side for some of the other things that we’ve talked about, so that ends up being important. but fundamentally, you know, looking at the model today, it seems like you should have something like this ability to clear history. it turns out that it’s a much more complex technical project. i’d talked about this at our developer conference last year, about how i’d hoped that we’d roll it out by the end of 2018 and just, the plumbing goes so deep into all the different systems that it’s, that– but we’re still working on it and we’re going to do it. it’s just it’s taking a little bit longer. jonathan zittrain: so clear history basically means i am as if a newb, i just show mark zuckerberg: yes. jonathan zittrain: even though i’ve been using facebook for a while, it’s as if it knows nothing about me and it starts accreting again. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i’m just trying to think just as a plain old citizen, how would i make an informed judgment about how often to do that or when i should do it? what–? mark zuckerberg: well, hold on. let’s go to that in a second. jonathan zittrain: okay. mark zuckerberg: but one thing, just to connect the dots on the last conversation. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: clear history is a prerequisite, i think, for being able to do anything like subscriptions. right. because, like, partially what someone would want to do if they were going to really actually pay for a not ad supported version where their data wasn’t being used in a system like that, you would want to have a control so that facebook didn’t have access or wasn’t using that data or associating it with your account. and as a principled matter, we are not going to just offer a control like that to people who pay. right. that’s going to, if we’re going to give controls over data use, we’re going to do that for everyone in the community. so that’s the first thing that i think we need to go do. mark zuckerberg: so that’s, so that’s kind of– this is sort of the how we’re thinking about the projects and this is a really deep and big technical project but we’re committed to doing it because i think it’s that’s what it’s there for. [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: and i guess like an ad block or somebody could then write a little script for your browser that would just clear your history every time you visit or something. mark zuckerberg: oh, yeah, no, but the plan would also be to offer something that’s an ongoing thing. jonathan zittrain: i see. mark zuckerberg: in your browser, but i think the analogy here is you kind of have, in your browser you have the ability to clear your cookies. and then, like, in some other place you have under your, like, nuclear settings, like, don’t ever accept any cookies in my browser. and it’s like, all right, your browser’s not really going to work that well. jonathan zittrain: yeah. <laughs> mark zuckerberg: but, but you can do that if you want because you should have that control. i think that these are part and parcel, right. it’s i think a lot of people might go and clear their history on a periodic basis because they– or, or actually in the research that we’ve done on this as we’ve been developing it, the real thing that people have told us that they want is similar to cookie management, not necessarily wiping everything, because that ends in inconvenience of getting logged out of a bunch of things, but there are just certain services or apps that you don’t want that data to be connected to your facebook account. so having the ability on an ad hoc basis to go through and say, “hey, stop associating this thing,” is going to end up being a quite important thing that i think we want to try to deliver. so that’s, this is partially as we’re getting into this, it’s a more complex thing but i think it’s very valuable. and i think if any conversation around the– around subscriptions, i think you would want to start with giving people these, make sure that everyone has these kind of controls. so that’s, we’re kind of in the early phases of doing that. the philosophical downstream question of whether you also let people pay to not have ads, i don’t know. there were a bunch of questions around whether that’s actually a good thing, but i personally don’t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads. that all of the research that we have, it’s it may still end up being the right thing to offer that as a choice down the line, but all of the data that i’ve seen suggests that the vast, vast, vast majority of people want a free service and that the ads, in a lot of places are not even that different from the organic content in terms of the quality of what people are being able to see. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: people like being able to get information from local businesses and things like that too, so. so there’s a lot of good there. jonathan zittrain: yeah. forty years ago it would have been the question of abc versus hbo and the answer turned out to be yes. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: so you’re right. and people might have different things. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: there’s a little paradox lingering in there about if something’s so important and vital that we wouldn’t want to deprive anybody of access to it but therefore nobody gets it until we figured out how to remove it for everybody. mark zuckerberg: what we– [ph?] +++ jonathan zittrain: in other words, if i could buy my way out of ads and data collection it wouldn’t be fair to those who can’t and therefore we all subsist with it until the advances you’re talking about. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i guess what i’m saying is on the data use, i don’t believe that that’s something that people should buy. i think the data principles that we have need to be uniformly available to everyone. that to me is a really important principle. it’s, like, maybe you could have a conversation about whether you should be able to pay and not see ads. that doesn’t feel like a moral question to me. jonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: but the question of whether you can pay to have different privacy controls feels wrong. so that to me is something that in any conversation about whether we’d evolve towards having a subscription service, i think you have to have these controls first and it’s a very deep thing. a technical problem to go do, but we’re– that’s why we’re working through that. jonathan zittrain: yes. so long as the privacy controls that we’re not able to buy our way into aren’t controls that people ought to have. you know, it’s just the kind of underlying question of is the system as it is that we can’t opt out of a fair system. and that’s of course, you know, you have to go into the details to figure out what you mean by it. but let’s in the remaining time we have left mark zuckerberg: how are we doing on time? jonathan zittrain: we’re good. we’re 76 minutes in. mark zuckerberg: all right, into– <laughter> mark zuckerberg: we’re going to get through maybe half the topics. jonathan zittrain: yeah, yeah, yeah. mark zuckerberg: and i’ll come back and do another one later. jonathan zittrain: i’m going to bring this in for a landing soon. on my agenda left includes such things as taking out of the box the independent review stuff, chat a little bit about that. i’d be curious, and this might be a nice thing, really, as we wrap up, which would be a sense of any vision you have for what would facebook look like in 10 or 15 years and how different would it be than the facebook of 10 years ago is compared to today. so that’s something i’d want to talk about. is there anything big on your list that you want to make sure we talk about? mark zuckerberg: those are good. those are good topics. jonathan zittrain: <laughs> fair enough. mark zuckerberg: <laughs> jonathan zittrain: so all right, the external review board. mark zuckerberg: yeah. so one of the big questions that i have just been thinking about is, you know, we make a lot of decisions around content enforcement and what stays up and what comes down. and having gone through this process over the last few years of working on the systems, one of the themes that i feel really strongly about is that we shouldn’t be making so many of these decisions ourselves. you know, one of the ways that i try to reason about this stuff is take myself out of the position of being ceo of the company, almost like a rawlsian perspective. if i was a different person, what would i want the ceo of the company to be able to do? and i would not want so many decisions about content to be concentrated with any individual. so– jonathan zittrain: it is weird to see big impactful, to use a terrible word, decisions about what a huge swath of humanity does or doesn’t see inevitably handled as, like, a customer service issue. it does feel like a mismatch, which is what i hear you saying. mark zuckerberg: so let’s, yeah, so i actually think the customer service analogy is a really interesting one. right. so when you email amazon, because they don’t, they make a mistake with your package, that’s customer support. right. i mean, they are trying to provide a service and generally, they can invest more in customer support and make people happier. we’re doing something completely different, right. when someone emails us with an issue or flags some content, they’re basically complaining about something that someone else in the community did. so it’s more like it’s almost more like a court system in that sense. doing more of that does not make people happy because in every one of those transactions one person ends up the winner and one is the loser. either you said that that content, that the content was fine, in which case the person complaining is upset, or you the someone’s content down, in which case the person is really upset because you’re now telling them that they don’t have the ability to express something that they feel is a valid thing that they should be able to express. so in some deep sense while some amount of what we do is customer support, people get locked out of their account, et cetera, you know, we now have, like, more than 30,000 people working on content review and safety review, doing the kind of judgments that, you know, it’s basically a lot of the stuff, we have machine learning systems that flag things that could be problematic in addition to people in the community flagging things, but making these assessments of whether the stuff is right or not. so one of the questions that i just think about, it’s like, okay, well, you have many people doing this. regardless of how much training they have, we’re going to make mistakes, right. so you want to start building in principles around, you know, what you would kind of think of as due process, right. so we’re building in an ability to have an appeal, right, which already is quite good in that we are able to overturn a bunch of mistakes that the first line people make in making these assessments. but at some level i think you also want a level of kind of independent appeal, right, where if, okay, let’s say, so the appeals go to maybe a higher level of facebook employee who is a little more trained in the nuances of the policies; but at some point, i think you also need an appeal to an independent groups, which is, like, is this policy fair? was this–? like is this piece of content really getting on the wrong side of the balance of free expression and safety? and i just don’t think at the end of the day that that’s something that you want centralized in a single company. so now the question is how do you design that system and that’s a real question, right, so that we don’t pretend to have the answers on this. what we’re basically working through is we have a draft proposal and we’re working with a lot of experts around the world to run a few pilots in the first half of this year that can hopefully we can codify into something that’s a longer term thing. but i just, i believe that this is just an incredibly important thing. as a person and if i take aside the role that i have as ceo of the company, i do not want the company being able to make all of those final decisions without a check and balance and accountability, so i want to use the position that i’m in to help build that kind of an institution. jonathan zittrain: yes. and when we talk about an appeal, then, it sounds like you could appeal two distinct things. one is this was the rule but it was applied wrong to me. this, in fact, was parody [ph?] so it shouldn’t be seen as near the line. mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and i want the independent body to look at that. the other would be the rule is wrong. the rule should change because– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: and you’re thinking the independent body could weigh in on both of those? mark zuckerberg: yeah. over time, i would like the role of the independent oversight board to be able to expand to do additional things as well. i think the question is it’s hard enough to even set something up that’s going to codify the values that we have around expression and safety on a relatively defined topic. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: so i think the question is if you kind of view this as an experiment in institution building where we’re trying to build this thing that is going to have real power tojonathan zittrain: yes. mark zuckerberg: i mean, like, i will not be able to make a decision that overturns what they say. which i think is good. i think also just it raises the stakes. you need to make sure we get this right, so. jonathan zittrain: it’s fascinating. it’s huge. i think the way you’re describing it, i wouldn’t want to understate– mark zuckerberg: yeah. jonathan zittrain: that this is not a usual way of doing business. mark zuckerberg: yeah, but i think it– i think this is– i really care about getting this right. jonathan zittrain: yeah. mark zuckerberg: but i think you want to start with something that’s relatively well-defined and then hopefully expand it to be able to cover more things over time. so in the beginning i think one question that could come up is my understanding, i mean, it’s always dangerous talking about legal precedence when i’m, this might be one of my first times at harvard law school. i did not spend a lot of time here<laughter> mark zuckerberg: when i was an undergrad. but, you know what i mean, the, if the supreme court overturns something, they don’t tell congress what the law should be, they just say there’s an issue here, right. and then basically there’s a process. all right. so if i’m getting that wrong<laughter> mark zuckerberg: all right. i shouldn’t have done that. jonathan zittrain: no, no. that’s quite honest. [ph?] mark zuckerberg: i knew that was dangerous. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: and that that was a mistake. jonathan zittrain: there are people who do agree with you. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: okay. oh, so that’s an open question that that’s how it works. jonathan zittrain: it’s a highly debated question, yes. mark zuckerberg: all right. jonathan zittrain: there’s the i’m just the umpire calling balls and strikes and in fact, the first type of question we brought up, which was, “hey, we get this is the standard. does it apply here?” lends itself a little more to, you know, you get three swings and if you miss them all, like, you can’t keep playing. the umpire can usher you away from the home plate. this is, i’m really digging deep into my knowledge now of baseball. there’s another thing about, like,– mark zuckerberg: that’s okay. i’m not the person who’s going to call you out on getting something wrong there. jonathan zittrain: i appreciate that. mark zuckerberg: that’s why i also need to have a librarian next to me at all times. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: very good. i wonder how much librarians tend to know about baseball. <laughter> mark zuckerberg: aww. jonathan zittrain: but we digress. ah, we’re going to get letters, mentions. mark zuckerberg: yeah. <laughter> jonathan zittrain: but whether or not the game is actually any good with a three strikes rule, maybe there should be two or four or whatever, starts to ask of the umpire more than just, you know, your best sense of how that play just went. both may be something. both are surely beyond standard customer service issues, so both could maybe be usefully externalized. what you’d ask the board to do in the category one kind of stuff maybe it’s true that, like, professional umpirage [ph?] could help us and there are people who are jurists who can do that worldwide. for the other, whether it’s the supreme jonathan zittrain: –court, or the so-called common law and state courts where often a state supreme court will be like, “henceforth, 50 feet needs to be the height of a baseball net,” and like, “if you don’t agree, legislature, we’ll hear from you, but until then it’s 50 feet.” they really do kind of get into the weeds. they derive maybe some legitimacy for decisions like that from being close to their communities, and it really regresses them to a question of: is facebook a global community, a community of 2.x billion people worldwide, transcending any national boundaries, and for which i think so far on these issues, it’s meant to be, “the rule is the rule,” it doesn’t really change in terms of service from one place to anotherversus how much do we think of it as somehow localized– whether or not localized through governmentbut where different local communities make their own judgments? mark zuckerberg: that is one of the big questions. i mean, right now we have community standards that are global. we follow local laws, as you say. but i think the idea is– i don’t think we want to end up in a place where we have very different norms in different places, but you want to have some sense of representation and making sure that the body that can deliberate on this has a good diversity of views. so these are a lot of the things that we’re trying to figure out, is like: well, how big is the body? when decisions are made, are they made by the whole body, or do you have panels of people that are smaller sets? if there are panels, how do you make sure that you’re not just getting a random sample that kind of skews in the values perspective towards one thing? so then there a bunch of mechanisms like, okay, maybe one panel that’s randomly constituted decides on whether the board will take up a question or one of the issues, but then a separate random panel of the group actually does the decisions, so that way you eliminate some risk that any given panel is going to be too ideologically skewed. so there’s a bunch of things that i think we need to think through and work through, but the goal on this is to, over time, have it grow into something that can provide greater accountability and oversight to potentially more of the hard questions that we face, but i think it’s so high-stakes that starting with something that’s relatively defined is going to be the right way to go in the beginning. so regardless of the fact that i was unaware of the controversy around the legal point that i made a second ago, i do think in our case it makes sense to start with not having this group say what the policies are going to be, but just have there be– have it be able to say, “hey, we think that you guys are on the wrong side on this, and maybe you should rethink where the policy is because we think you’re on the wrong side.” there’s one other thing that i think is worth calling out, which is in a typical kind of judicial analog, or at least here in the u.s., my understanding, is there’s the kind of appeal route to the independent board considering an issue, but i also think that we want to have an avenue where we as the company can also just raise hard issues that come up to the board without having– which i don’t actually know if there’s any mechanism for that. jonathan zittrain: it’s called an advisory opinion. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: but under u.s. federal law, it’s not allowed because of article iii case or controversy requirement, but state courts do it all the time. you’ll have a federal court sometimes say– because it’s a federal court but it’s deciding something under state law. it’ll be like, “i don’t know, ask florida.” and they’ll be like, “hey florida,” and then florida is just florida. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: sure. so i think that– jonathan zittrain: so you can do an advisory opinion. mark zuckerberg: –that’ll end up being an important part of this too. we’re never going to be able to get out of the business of making frontline judgments. we’ll have the ai systems flag content that they think is against policies or could be, and then we’ll have people– this set of 30 thousand people, which is growing– that is trained to basically understand what the policies are. we have to make the frontline decisions, because a lot of this stuff needs to get handled in a timely way, and a more deliberative process that’s thinking about the fairness and the policies overall should happen over a different timeframe than what is often relevant, which is the enforcement of the initial policy. but i do think overall for a lot of the biggest questions, i just want to build a more independent process. jonathan zittrain: well, as you say, it’s an area with fractal complexity in the best of ways, and it really is terra incognito, and it’d be exciting to see how it might be built out. i imagine there’s a number of law professors around the world, including some who come from civil rather than common law jurisdictions, who are like, “this is how it works over here,” from which you could draw. another lingering question would be– lawyers often have a bad reputation. i have no idea why. but they often are the glue for a system like this so that a judge does not have to be oracular or omniscient. there’s a process where the lawyer for one side does a ton of work and looks at prior decisions of this board and says, “well, this is what would be consistent,” and the other lawyer comes back, and then the judge just gets to decide between the two, rather than having to just know everything. there’s a huge tradeoff here for every appealed content decision, how much do we want to build it into a case, and you need experts to help the parties, versus they each just sort of come before solomon and say, “this kind of happened,” and– or judge judy maybe is a more contemporary reference. mark zuckerberg: somewhere between the two, yeah. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: yeah. so it’s a lot of stuff– and for me, i both find myself– i don’t know if this is the definition of prurient– both excited by it and somewhat terrified by it, but very much saying that it’s better than a status quo, which is where i think you and i are completely agreeing, and maybe a model for other firms out there. so that’s the last question in this area that pops to my mind, which is: what part of what you’re developing at facebook– a lot of which is really resource-intensive– is best thought of as a public good to be shared, including among basically competitors, versus, “that’s part of our comparative advantage and our secret sauce”? if you develop a particularly good algorithm that can really well detect fake news or spammers or bad actors– you’ve got the phds, you’ve got the processors– is that like, “in your face, schmitter [ph?],” or is like, “we should have somebody that– some body– that can help democratize that advance”? and it could be the same to be said for these content decisions. how do you think about that? mark zuckerberg: yeah, so certainly the threat-sharing and security work that you just referenced is a good area where there’s much better collaboration now than there was historically. i think that that’s just because everyone recognizes that it’s such a more important issue. and by the way, there’s much better collaboration with governments now too on this, and not just our own here in the u.s., and law enforcement, but around the world with election commissions and law enforcement, because there’s just a broad awareness that these are issues and that– jonathan zittrain: especially if you have state actors in the mix as the adversary. mark zuckerberg: yes. so that’s certainly an area where there’s much better collaboration now, and that’s good. there’s still issues. for example, if you’re law enforcement or intelligence and you have developed a– “source” is not the right word– but basically if you’ve identified someone as a source of signals that you can watch and learn about, then you may not want to come to us and tell us, “hey, we’ve identified that this state actor is doing this bad thing,” because then the natural thing that we’re going to want to do is make sure that they’re not on our system doing bad things, or that they’re not– either they’re not in the system at all or that we’re interfering with the bad things that they’re trying to do. so there’s some mismatch of incentives, but as you build up the relationships and trust, you can get to that kind of a relationship where they can also flag for you, “hey, this is what we’re at.” so i just think having that kind of baseline where you build that up over time is helpful. and i think on security and safety is probably the biggest area of that kind of collaboration now, across all the different types of threats; not just election and democratic process type stuff, but any kind of safety issue. the other area where i tend to think about what we’re doing is– it should be open– is just technical infrastructure overall. i mean, that is probably a less controversial piece, but we open-source a lot of the basic stuff that runs our systems, and i think that that is a– that’s a contribution that i’m quite proud of that we do. we have sort of pioneered this way of thinking about how people connect, and the data model around that is more of a graph, and the idea of graph database and a lot of the infrastructure for being able to efficiently access that kind of content i think is broadly applicable beyond the context of a social network. when i was here as an undergrad, even though i wasn’t here for very long, i studied psychology and computer science, and to me– i mean, my grounding philosophy on this stuff is that basically people should be at the center of more of the technology that we build. i mean, one of the early things that i kind of recognized when i was a student was like– at the time, there were internet sites for finding almost anything you cared about, whether it’s books or music or news or information or businesses– but as people, we think about the world primarily in terms of other people, not in terms of other objects, not cutting things up in terms of content or commerce or politics or different things, but it’s like– the stuff should be organized around the connections that people have, where people are at the centerpiece of that, and one of the missions that i care about is over time just pushing more technology development in the tech industry overall to develop things with that mindset. i think– and this is a little bit of a tangentbut the way that our phones work today, and all computing systems, organized around apps and tasks is fundamentally not how people– how our brains work and how we approach the world. it’s not– so that’s one of the reasons why i’m just very excited longer-term about especially things like augmented reality, because it’ll give us a platform that i think actually is how we think about stuff. we’ll be able to bring the computational objects into the world but fundamentally we’ll be interacting as people around them. the whole thing won’t be organized around an app or a task; it’ll be organized around people, and that i think is a much more natural and human system for how our technology should be organized. so opensourcing all of that infrastructure– to do that, and enabling not just us but other companies to kind of get that mindset into more of their thinking and the technical underpinning of that, is just something that i care really deeply about. jonathan zittrain: well, this is nice, and this is bringing us in for our landing, because we’re talking about 10, 20, 30 years ahead. as a term of art, i understand augmented reality to mean, “i’ve got a visor”version 0.1 was google glass– something where i’m kind of out in the world but i’m literally online at the same time because there’s data coming at me in some– that’s what you’re talking about, correct? mark zuckerberg: yeah, although it really should be glasses like what you have. i think we’ll probablymaybe they’ll have to be a little bigger, but not too much bigger or else it would start to get weird. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: so i don’t think a visor is going to catch. i don’t think anyone is psyched about that feature. jonathan zittrain: and anything involving surgery starts to sound a little bad too. mark zuckerberg: no, no, we’re definitely focused on– <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: –on external things. although– jonathan zittrain: like, “don’t make news, don’t make news, don’t make news.” <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. although we have showed this demo of basically can someone type by thinking, and of course when you’re talking about brain-computer interfaces, there’s two dimensions of that work. there’s the external stuff, and there’s the internal stuff, and invasive, and yes, of course if you’re actually trying to build things that everyone is going to use, you’re going to want to focus on the noninvasive things. jonathan zittrain: yes. can you type by thinking? mark zuckerberg: you can. jonathan zittrain: it’s called a ouija board. no. but you’re subvocalizing enough or there’s enough of a read of– mark zuckerberg: no, no, no. so there’s actually a bunch of the research here– there’s a question of throughput and how quickly can you type and how many bits can you express efficiently, but the basic foundation for the research is someone– a bunch of folks who are doing this research showed a bunch of people images– i think it was animals– so, “here’s an elephant, here’s a giraffe”– while having kind of a net on their head, noninvasive, but shining light and therefore looking at the level of blood activity andjust blood flow and activity in the brain– trained a machine learning basically on what the pattern of that imagery looked like when the person was looking at different animals, then told the person to think about an animal, right? so think about– just pick one of the animals to think about, and can predict what the person was thinking about in broad strokes just based on matching the neural activity. so the question is, so you can use that to type. jonathan zittrain: fifth amendment implications are staggering. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: sorry. mark zuckerberg: well, yes. i mean, presumably this would be something that someone would choose to use a product. i’m not– yeah, yeah. i mean, yes, there’s of course all the other implications, but yeah, i think that this is going to be– that’s going to be an interesting thing down the line. jonathan zittrain: but basically your vision then for a future– mark zuckerberg: i don’t know how we got onto that. <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: you can’t blame me. i think you brought this up. mark zuckerberg: i did, but of all the things that– i mean, this is exciting, but we haven’t even covered yet how we should talk about– tech regulation and all this stuff i figured we’d get into. i mean, we’ll be here for like six or seven hours. i don’t know how many days you want to spend here to talking about this, but– jonathan zittrain: “we’re here at the zuckerberg center and hostage crisis.” <audience laughter> jonathan zittrain: “the building is surrounded.” mark zuckerberg: yeah. but i think a little bit on future tech and research is interesting too, so. jonathan zittrain: please. mark zuckerberg: yeah, we’re good. jonathan zittrain: oh, we did cover it, is what you’re saying. <audience laughter> mark zuckerberg: i mean, but going back to your question about what– if this is the last topic– what i’m excited about for the next 10 or 20 years– i do think over the long term, reshaping our computing platforms to be fundamentally more about people and how we process the world is a really fundamental thing. over the nearer term– so call it five years– i think the clear trend is towards more private communication. if you look at all of the different ways that people want to share and communicate across the internet– but we have a good sense of the cross-strength, everything from one-on-one messages to kind of broadcasting publicly– the thing that is growing the fastest is private communication. right? so between whatsapp and messenger, and instagram now, just the number of private messages– it’s about 100 billion a day through those systems alone, growing very quickly, growing much faster than the amount that people want to share or broadcast into a feed-type system. of the type of broadcast content that people are doing, the thing that is growing by far the fastest is stories. right? so ephemeral sharing of, “i’m going to put this out, but i want to have a timeframe after which the data goes away.” so i think that that just gives you a sense of where the hub of social activity is going. it also is how we think about the strategy of the company. i mean, people– when we talk about privacy, i think a lot of the questions are often about privacy policies and legal or policy-type things, and privacy as a thing not to be breached, and making sure that you’re within the balance of what is good. but i actually think that there’s a much more– there’s another element of this that’s really fundamental, which is that people want tools that give them new contexts to communicate, and that’s also fundamentally about giving people power through privacy, not just not violating privacy, right? so not violating privacy is a backstop, but actually– you can kind of think about all the success that facebook has had– this is kind of a counterintuitive thing– has been because we’ve given people new private or semi-private ways to communicate things that they wouldn’t have had before. so thinking about facebook as an innovator in privacy is certainly not the mainstream view, but going back to the very first thing that we did, making it so harvard students could communicate in a way that they had some confidence that their content and information would be shared with only people within that community, there was no way that people had to communicate stuff at that scale, but not have it either be completely public or with just a small set of people before. and people’s desire to be understood and express themselves and be able to communicate with all different kinds of groups is, in the experience that i’ve had, nearly unbounded, and if you can give people new ways to be able to communicate safely and express themselves, then that is something that people just have a deep thirst and desire for. so encryption is really important, because i mean, we take for granted in the u.s. that there’s good rule of law, and that the government isn’t too much in our business, but in a lot of places around the world, especially where whatsapp is the biggest, people can’t take that for granted. so having it so that you really have confidence that you’re sharing something one-on-one and it’s not– and it really is one-on-one, it’s not one-on-one and the government there– actually makes it so people can share things that they wouldn’t be comfortable otherwise doing it. that’s power that you’re giving people through building privacy innovations. stories i just think is another example of this, where there are a lot of things that people don’t want as part of the permanent record but want to express, and it’s not an accident that that is becoming the primary way that people want to share with all of their friends, not putting something in a feed that goes on their permanent record. there will always be a use for that too– people want to have a record and there’s a lot of value that you can build around that– you can have longer-term discussions– it’s harder to do that around stories. there’s different value for these things. but over the next five years, i think we’re going to see all of social networking kind of be reconstituted around this base of private communication, and that’s something that i’m just very excited about. i think that that’s– it’s going to unlock a lot of people’s ability to express themselves and communicate things that they haven’t had the tools to do before, and it’s going to be the foundation for building a lot of really important tools on top of that too. jonathan zittrain: that’s so interesting to me. i would not have predicted that direction for the next five years. i would have figured, “gosh, if you already know with whom you want to speak, there are so many tools to speak with them,” some of which are end-to-end, some of which aren’t, some of which are rollyourown and open-source, and there’s always a way to try to make that easier and better, but that feels a little bit to me like a kind of crowded space, not yet knowing of the innovations that might lie ahead and means of communicating with the people you already know you want to talk to. and for that, as you say, if that’s where it’s at, you’re right that encryption is going to be a big question, and otherwise technical design so that if the law comes knocking on the door, what would the company be in a position to say. this is the apple iphone cupertino– sorry, san bernardino case– and it also calls to mind will there be peer-to-peer implementations of the things you’re thinking about that might not even need the server at all, and it’s basically just an app that people use, and if it’s going to deliver an ad, it can still do that appside, and how much governments will abide it. they have not, for the most part, demanded technology mandates to reshape how the technology works. they’re just saying, “if you’ve got it”– in part you’ve got it because you want to serve ads– “we want it.” but if you don’t even have it, it’s been rare for the governments to say, “well, you’ve got to build your system to do it.” it did happen with the telephone system back in the day. calea, the communications assistance to law enforcement act, did have federal law in the united states saying, “if you’re in the business of building a phone network, at&t, you’ve got to make it so we can plug in as you go digital,” and we haven’t yet seen those mandates in the internet software side so much. so we can see that coming up again. but it’s so funny, because if you’d asked me, i would have figured it’s encountering people you haven’t met before and interacting with them, for which all of the stuff about air traffic control of what goes into your feed and how much your stuff gets shared– all of those issues start to rise to the fore, and it gets me thinking about, “i ought to be able to make a feed recipe that’s my recipe, and fills it according to facebook variables, but i get to say what the variables are.” but i could see that if you’re just thinking about people communicating with the people they already know and like, that is a very different realm. mark zuckerberg: it’s not necessarily– it’s not just the people that you already know. i do think– we’ve really focused on friends and family for the last 10 or 15 years, and i think a big part of what we’re going to focus on now is around building communities in different ways and all the utility that you can build on top of, once you have a network like this in place. so everything from how people can do commerce better to things like dating, which is– a lot of dating happens on our services, but we haven’t built any tools specifically for that. jonathan zittrain: i do remember the facebook joint experiment– “experiment” is such a terrible wordstudy, by which one could predict when two facebook members are going to declare themselves in a relationship, months ahead of the actual declaration. i was thinking some of the ancillary products were in-laws. mark zuckerberg: that was very early. yeah. so you’re right that a lot of this is going to be about utility that you can build on top of it, but a lot of these things are fundamentally private, right? so if you’re thinking about commerce, that people have a higher expectation for privacy, and the question is: is the right context for that going to be around an app like facebook, which is broad, or an app like instagram? i think part of it is– the discovery part of it, i think we’ll be very well served there– but then we’ll also transition to something that people want to be more private and secure. anyhow, we could probably go on for many hours on this, but maybe we should save this for the round 2 of this that we’ll do in the future. jonathan zittrain: indeed. so thanks so much for coming out, for talking at such length, for covering such a kaleidoscopic range of topics, and we look forward to the next time we see you. mark zuckerberg: yeah. thanks. jonathan zittrain: thanks. <audience applause>"
"apple is telling app developers to remove or properly disclose their use of analytics code that allows them to record how a user interacts with their iphone apps — or face removal from the app store, techcrunch can confirm. in an email, an apple spokesperson said: “protecting user privacy is paramount in the apple ecosystem. our app store review guidelines require that apps request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity.” “we have notified the developers that are in violation of these strict privacy terms and guidelines, and will take immediate action if necessary,” the spokesperson added. it follows an investigation by techcrunch that revealed major companies, like expedia, hollister and hotels.com, were using a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app. we found that none of the apps we tested asked the user for permission, and none of the companies said in their privacy policies that they were recording a user’s app activity. even though sensitive data is supposed to be masked, some data — like passport numbers and credit card numbers — was leaking. glassbox is a cross-platform analytics tool that specializes in session replay technology. it allows companies to integrate its screen recording technology into their apps to replay how a user interacts with the apps. glassbox says it provides the technology, among many reasons, to help reduce app error rates. but the company “doesn’t enforce its customers” to mention that they use glassbox’s screen recording tools in their privacy policies. but apple expressly forbids apps that covertly collect data without a user’s permission. techcrunch began hearing on thursday that app developers had already been notified that their apps had fallen afoul of apple’s rules. one app developer was told by apple to remove code that recorded app activities, citing the company’s app store guidelines. “your app uses analytics software to collect and send user or device data to a third party without the user’s consent. apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity,” apple said in the email. apple gave the developer less than a day to remove the code and resubmit their app or the app would be removed from the app store, the email said. when asked if glassbox was aware of the app store removals, a spokesperson for glassbox said that “the communication with apple is through our customers.” glassbox is also available to android app developers. google did not immediately comment if it would also ban the screen recording code. google play also expressly prohibits apps from secretly collecting device usage. “apps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality,” the developer rules state. we’ll update if and when we hear back. it’s the latest privacy debacle that has forced apple to wade in to protect its customers after apps were caught misbehaving. last week, techcrunch reported that apple banned facebook’s “research” app that the social media giant paid teenagers to collect all of their data. it followed another investigation by techcrunch that revealed facebook misused its apple-issued enterprise developer certificate to build and provide apps for consumers outside apple’s app store. apple temporarily revoked facebook’s enterprise developer certificate, knocking all of the company’s internal ios apps offline for close to a day. many popular iphone apps secretly record your screen without asking"
