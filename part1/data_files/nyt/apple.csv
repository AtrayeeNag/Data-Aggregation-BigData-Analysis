For many of us, their glowing screens are a ubiquitous presence, drawing us in with endless diversions, like the warm ping of social approval delivered in the forms of likes and retweets, and the algorithmically amplified outrage of the latest “breaking” news or controversy. They’re in our hands, as soon as we wake, and command our attention until the final moments before we fall asleep.Steve Jobs would not approve.In 2007, Mr. Jobs took the stage at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco and introduced the world to the iPhone. If you watch the full speech, you’ll be surprised by how he imagined our relationship with this iconic invention, because this vision is so different from the way most of us use these devices now.In the remarks, after discussing the phone’s interface and hardware, he spends an extended amount of time demonstrating how the device leverages the touch screen before detailing the many ways Apple engineers improved the age-old process of making phone calls. “It’s the best iPod we’ve ever made,” Mr. Jobs exclaims at one point. “The killer app is making calls,” he later adds. Both lines spark thunderous applause. He doesn’t dedicate any significant time to discussing the phone’s internet connectivity features until more than 30 minutes into the address.The presentation confirms that Mr. Jobs envisioned a simpler and more constrained iPhone experience than the one we actually have over a decade later. For example, he doesn’t focus much on apps. When the iPhone was first introduced there was no App Store, and this was by design. As Andy Grignon, an original member of the iPhone team, told me when I was researching this topic, Mr. Jobs didn’t trust third-party developers to offer the same level of aesthetically pleasing and stable experiences that Apple programmers could produce. He was convinced that the phone’s carefully designed native features were enough. It was “an iPod that made phone calls,” Mr. Grignon said to me. Mr. Jobs seemed to understand the iPhone as something that would help us with a small number of activities — listening to music, placing calls, generating directions. He didn’t seek to radically change the rhythm of users’ daily lives. He simply wanted to take experiences we already found important and make them better.The minimalist vision for the iPhone he offered in 2007 is unrecognizable today — and that’s a shame.Under what I call the “constant companion model,” we now see our smartphones as always-on portals to information. Instead of improving activities that we found important before this technology existed, this model changes what we pay attention to in the first place — often in ways designed to benefit the stock price of attention-economy conglomerates, not our satisfaction and well-being.We’ve become so used to the constant companion model over the past decade that it’s easy to forget its novelty. As a computer scientist who also writes about the impact of technology on culture, I think it’s important to highlight the magnitude of this shift, as it seems increasingly clear to me that Mr. Jobs probably got it right the first time: Many of us would be better off returning to his original minimalist vision for our phones.Practically speaking, to be a minimalist smartphone user means that you deploy this device for a small number of features that do things you value (and that the phone does particularly well), and then outside of these activities, put it away. This approach dethrones this gadget from a position of constant companion down to a luxury object, like a fancy bike or a high-end blender, that gives you great pleasure when you use it but doesn’t dominate your entire day.To succeed with this approach, a useful first step is to remove from your smartphone any apps that make money from your attention. This includes social media, addictive games and newsfeeds that clutter your screen with “breaking” notifications. Unless you’re a cable news producer, you don’t need minute-by-minute updates on world events, and your friendships are likely to survive even if you have to wait until you’re sitting at your home computer to log on to Facebook or Instagram. In addition, by eliminating your ability to publish carefully curated images to social media directly from your phone, you can simply be present in a nice moment, free from the obsessive urge to document it.Turning our attention to professional activities, if your work doesn’t absolutely demand that you be accessible by email when away from your desk, delete the Gmail app or disconnect the built-in email client from your office servers. It’s occasionally convenient to check in when out and about, but this occasional convenience almost always comes at the cost of developing a compulsive urge to monitor your messages constantly. If you’re not sure whether your work requires phone-based email, don’t ask; just delete the apps and wait to see whether it causes a problem — many people unintentionally exaggerate their need to constantly be available.Once you’ve stripped away the digital chatter clamoring for your attention, your smartphone will return to something closer to the role originally conceived by Mr. Jobs. It will become a well-designed object that comes out occasionally throughout your day to support — not subvert — your efforts to live well: It helps you find that perfect song to listen to while walking across town on a sunny fall afternoon; it loads up directions to the restaurant where you’re meeting a good friend; with just a few swipes, it allows you to place a call to your mom — and then it can go back into your pocket, or your bag, or the hall table by your front door, while you move on with the business of living your real-world life.Early in his 2007 keynote, Mr. Jobs said, “Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.” What he didn’t add, however, was the follow-up promise that “tomorrow, we’re going to reinvent your life.” The iPhone is a fantastic phone, but it was never meant to be the foundation for a new form of existence in which the digital increasingly encroaches on the analog. If you return this innovation to its original limited role, you’ll get more out of both your phone and your life.Cal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown and the author of the forthcoming book “Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.

5c3105bc3a125f5075c02fda,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/sunday/apple-china.html,"I got my first iPhone during Chinese New Year in early 2012. It wasn’t anything I’d aspired to own. I wasn’t particularly techy, nor could I afford the brand as a graduate with a starting salary.But at a dinner with an old friend of my father’s, the friend gave me, along with other knickknacks, an iPhone 4. My gift came with a caveat, however: It wasn’t the sought-after 4S that had caused a frenzy around the country after its release in January. Mine was a simple iPhone 4 — released in 2010, and by then considered already past its prime as a formal gift. That meant I was almost certainly a secondary or even tertiary receiver of the phone — China’s gift-giving culture is all about regifting — but back then, the Apple brand carried enough cachet that my father’s friend still saw it as good enough to give a close friend’s daughter, if not quite prized enough to present to a business partner.That was back when Apple was still the phone to own for a Chinese person on the make, and when people like my father and his friends — mostly older, and in senior positions in large organizations — were still caught up in the legend of the Apple product, even though most of them, including him, had no idea how to use most of the features. That didn’t matter; it was enough to know that iPhones were “the best.” Their global reputations came with an assurance of both status and quality.What’s happened in the interim? A lot. When Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, warned investors on Wednesday that the company was facing slowing sales in China, the wider world seemingly greeted the news that Apple had lost its China mojo with shock. But for those who are smartphone users in China, the news just confirmed what we already knew: China’s domestic brands have made huge strides in the years since 2012, creating new features and products that take into account what Chinese users want, for a small fraction of the price. Apple, meanwhile, has mostly failed to localize or reinvent itself, on the assumption that global cachet would be enough.The homegrown groundswell began with a little-known brand called Xiaomi, which burst onto the scene in the early 2010s as one of the first brands in China to have its own operating system, and offered high-speed processing on the cheap. At first it appeared to cater to a completely different market than Apple. Selling entirely online, Xiaomi offered both a low-end model — the Redmi for as low as 699 yuan (then under $150) — and a higher-end model that was still far cheaper than the cheapest iPhone (less than 2,000 yuan, then under $350).But with time, the useful features on Xiaomi products, as well as those of its competitors like Huawei and OPPO, combined with the price, began to outweigh the increasingly limited glamour of the iPhone. I myself transitioned to a high-end Xiaomi from an iPhone in late 2015 after a young professional friend of mine, who worked in marketing in Shanghai, raved about the Xiaomi Mi Note, which is one of the big-screen models, or “phablets,” that have long been popular in China and East Asia, where many prefer the bigger screens — Huawei’s latest measures a whopping 7.2 inches — ideal for taking selfies and watching TV dramas. (Apple released its Plus series in late 2014 with larger handsets, which did send its sales shooting up in China — but also added $100 to an already expensive price tag.)Apple also long resisted the rise of another important local feature: the dual SIM card system, a component that may sound boring but for Chinese people has become essential. In China, where many young people have never owned laptops, phones have become all-in-one devices — part television, part computer, part phone. Transitioning between two SIM cards on all other cell brands is a seamless process: one card for streaming and downloading at cheaper rates, the other one for making calls. Growing international tourism has also raised demand for phones that can accommodate a second, foreign SIM — and yet for years, Apple didn’t budge. The company finally gave in to the dual SIM card in the form of special models for China and Hong Kong last fall.It’s telling that the main example of Apple localizing its products to China in the last few years was a special model gold-colored iPhone. First introduced in 2013, it was a clear play for the Chinese market, and was, admittedly, a huge hit on the mainland. Many joked that the gold iPhone was targeted at the tuhao, a recent term that roughly translates as “tasteless nouveau riche” and that mockingly refers to the wealthy who feel the need to show off. The color was even given the name tuhao jin, or tuhao gold.But the allure of gold-colored plating — a feature focused not on user experience but aesthetics — goes only so far, it seems. And it may not be enough at this point to keep even the tuhao loyal. Huawei, China’s largest smartphone maker by market share, recently overtook Apple to move to second place globally. Its popularity among the wealthy and business class at home has shot up in recent years; its prices have been steadily rising as it shifts focus toward higher-end products. Many upper-middle-class Chinese who once owned iPhones have since switched to Huawei — including my dad.As China has moved online en masse, it has, perhaps, surprised some analysts who believed that the appeal of high-end brands as status symbols would drive decision-making for years into the future. It turns out that Chinese consumers care about user experience, too (and price, of course).But the iPhone hasn’t lost all of its luster. A civil servant friend of mine was still offered a brand-new iPhone as a “gift” in 2016; I’ve yet to hear of anyone who was bribed with a Huawei.

The XR is the cheapest series among iPhones Apple launched last year.The change in pricing of the iPhone XR is a short-term promotional offer, an industry source said.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.The price reduction comes after iPhone prices were lowered in China for the second time this year, as Apple wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world's largest smartphone market partly due to a slowing economy.In India, Apple's iPhones are up against the more competitive pricing of rival handsets from South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and China's OnePlus.""The focus of this entire (price cut) exercise is to win customers who would have thought of going to Samsung or OnePlus, to make them think whether they can spend some extra money on an iPhone XR - it's more bang for the buck,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech research firm Canalys.Samsung's latest Galaxy S10e is priced at 55,900 rupees while the OnePlus 6T starts at 37,999 rupees.Apple's share of India's $400-plus smartphone segment stood at 23 percent in 2018, behind both Samsung and OnePlus, showed data from Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint.But with a share of just 1 percent of India's entire smartphone market, Apple responded last year by revamping its sales and distribution strategy.Apple also plans to increase local production in a move that could help it limit the impact of a China-U.S. trade war. The company will soon begin assembling its top-end phones through the local unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), Reuters previously reported.

5c4fda7a3a125f5075c06ce9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/personaltech/facetime-bug-iphone-hack.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — The iPhone as an eavesdropping device? Watch out. It can happen.On Monday, Twitter and other social networking sites lit up with anxious Apple users after the news site 9to5Mac reported on a strange glitch in the company’s iPhones. The issue: It turns out that an iPhone user can call another iPhone user and listen in on that person’s conversations through the device’s microphone — even if the recipient does not answer the call.The problem was the result of a bug and involves Apple’s FaceTime app for placing video and audio calls over an internet connection. The bug could also give a caller access to a live feed of the recipient’s camera.On Monday night, Apple said it had disabled Group FaceTime, the feature that was causing the glitch.The glitch is embarrassing for Apple, which is set to report disappointing financial earnings on Tuesday. The Silicon Valley company has long positioned itself as a protector of user privacy offering more secure devices than its rivals.“We’re aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week,” Apple said in a statement.The glitch has already spurred warnings from officials. In a statement issued late Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York urged FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.[Read how to disable FaceTime.]“The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk,” he said.I replicated the bug using two iPhones. I began by placing a FaceTime call to the other iPhone, and while the call was ringing, I swiped up on the screen, hit add person and added myself to the conversation. From there, I was able to listen in on the recipient’s microphone, even if the person did not pick up.[Read about the tiny screw that illustrates why Apple probably won’t be assembling iPhones in the United States.]If the recipient hit the volume-down or volume-up buttons during this process, the caller could also see a live video feed of the recipient’s front-facing iPhone camera.How to handle this? Until the fix is released, iPhone users should go into the phone’s settings and disable FaceTime. Start by opening the Settings app, then tap FaceTime and toggle off FaceTime."

5c2d35393a125f5075c0296d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing of China’s economy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.Apple’s surprise announcement was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble. Beijing’s effort last spring to clamp down on credit, which sparked a slowdown, and an intensifying trade war with the United States have unnerved consumers and businesspeople alike.“Apple is a bellwether,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren’t buying it, then that’s a pretty good sign they’re having a hard time.”It is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China’s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market’s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.With more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China — or have as much to lose. China is Apple’s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company’s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.“While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,” Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.”Apple’s revenue warnings sent its shares down more than 7 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening, dropping its market value to less than $700 billion. Apple had become the first company to surpass a $1 trillion valuation in August.Its declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple’s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.[See how investors reacted to Apple’s news.]Mr. Cook has for years navigated the difficult politics of China, including its tightening controls over the internet, but the Trump administration’s tougher stance on the country is posing a challenge.The iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple’s profits.The company’s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.While Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.Huawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.Finding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple’s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.Many expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.Car sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.Unsold apartments are clogging the country’s real estate market and eroding prices. That is a big threat to China’s economic growth in the new year because the frenzied construction and outfitting of new homes has accounted for a quarter or more of economic output in recent years, outshining even exports.There are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.“The worst is yet to come,” Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.The Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.But tensions continue to grow. Canada’s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company’s founder.The Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.“If people aren’t buying iPhones, they’re probably not buying everything else,” Mr. Zandi said. “It symbolizes how deep China’s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.”"
5c4ed2ab3a125f5075c06a7c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/iphones-apple-china-made.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Despite a trade war between the United States and China and past admonishments from President Trump “to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” Apple is unlikely to bring its manufacturing closer to home.A tiny screw illustrates why.In 2012, Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, went on prime-time television to announce that Apple would make a Mac computer in the United States. It would be the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers, and the top-of-the-line Mac Pro would come with an unusual inscription: “Assembled in USA.”But when Apple began making the $3,000 computer in Austin, Tex., it struggled to find enough screws, according to three people who worked on the project and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.In China, Apple relied on factories that can produce vast quantities of custom screws on short notice. In Texas, where they say everything is bigger, it turned out the screw suppliers were not.[Apple disabled the iPhone’s Group FaceTime feature to fix a bug that made eavesdropping possible.]Tests of new versions of the computer were hamstrung because a 20-employee machine shop that Apple’s manufacturing contractor was relying on could produce at most 1,000 screws a day.The screw shortage was one of several problems that postponed sales of the computer for months, the people who worked on the project said. By the time the computer was ready for mass production, Apple had ordered screws from China.The challenges in Texas illustrate problems that Apple would face if it tried to move a significant amount of manufacturing out of China. Apple has found that no country — and certainly not the United States — can match China’s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost.ImageTimothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, helped lead the company’s shift to foreign manufacturing in 2004.CreditErica Yoon for The New York Times[Apple computers were once made in Silicon Valley. It did not go well.]  In China, you will also find one of Apple’s most important markets, and over the last month the risks that come with that dependence have become apparent. On Jan. 2, Apple said it would miss earnings expectations for the first time in 16 years, mostly because of slowing iPhone sales in China. On Tuesday, the company is expected to reveal more details about its financial results for the most recent quarter and its forecast for the coming year.The company could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China — something the president has threatened to do.Apple has intensified a search for ways to diversify its supply chain, but that hunt has homed in on India and Vietnam, according to an Apple executive who asked not to be named because the executive was not authorized to speak publicly. The company’s executives are increasingly worried that its heavy dependence on China for manufacturing is risky amid the country’s rising political tensions with the United States and unpredictability, this person said.“The skill here is just incredible,” Mr. Cook said at a conference in China in late 2017. Making Apple products requires state-of-the-art machines and lots of people who know how to run them, he said.“In the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I’m not sure we could fill the room,” he said. “In China, you could fill multiple football fields.”Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the company was “an engine of economic growth in the United States” that spent $60 billion last year with 9,000 American suppliers, helping to support 450,000 jobs. Apple’s Texas manufacturer, Flextronics, did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Cook helped lead Apple’s shift to foreign manufacturing in 2004, a move that cut costs and provided the enormous scale necessary to produce some of history’s best-selling tech products.Apple contracted much of the work to enormous factories in China, some stretching miles and employing hundreds of thousands of people who assemble, test and package Apple products. That assembly includes parts made around the world — from Norway to the Philippines to Pocatello, Idaho — that are shipped to China.ImageThe final assembly is the most labor-intensive part of building the iPhone, and its location often determines a product’s country of origin for tariffs.CreditKarly Domb Sadof/Associated PressThe final assembly is the most labor-intensive part of building the iPhone, and its location often determines a product’s country of origin for tariffs.Mr. Cook often bristles at the notion that iPhones are Chinese-made. Apple points out that Corning, at a factory in Kentucky, makes many iPhone screens and that a company in Allen, Tex., makes laser technology for the iPhones’ facial-recognition system.Mr. Cook has also disputed that cheap labor is the reason Apple is still in China. But it doesn’t hurt. The minimum wage in Zhengzhou, China, home of the world’s biggest iPhone factory, is roughly $2.10 an hour, including benefits. Apple said the starting pay for workers assembling its products there was about $3.15 an hour. Compensation for similar jobs in the United States is significantly higher.While it was one of Apple’s most powerful computers, the American-made Mac Pro also turned out to be one of its most expensive.Chinese suppliers shipped their components to Texas. But in some cases, the Texas team needed new parts as designs changed, and engineers who were tasked with designing the computer found themselves calling machine shops in central Texas.That is how they found Stephen Melo, the owner and president of Caldwell Manufacturing in Lockhart. Employees of Flextronics, the company hired by Apple to build the computers, in turn hired Caldwell to make 28,000 screws — though they would have liked more.When Mr. Melo bought Caldwell in 2002, it was capable of the high-volume production Apple needed. But demand for that had dried up as manufacturing moved to China. He said he had replaced the old stamping presses that could mass-produce screws with machines designed for more precise, specialized jobs.Mr. Melo thought it was ironic that Apple, a leader in offshore manufacturing, had come calling with a big order. “It’s hard to invest for that in the U.S. because that stuff is purchased very cheaply overseas,” he said.ImageWorkers heading to a Foxconn factory dedicated to iPhones in Zhengzhou, China, in 2015. Such factories can employ hundreds of thousands of people who assemble, test and package Apple products.CreditGilles Sabrie for The New York TimesHe made do with his new machines, although he could not make the exact screws Apple wanted. His company delivered 28,000 screws over 22 trips. Mr. Melo often made the one-hour drive himself in his Lexus sedan.A former Apple manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Flextronics team had also been far smaller than what he typically found on similar Apple projects in China. It was unclear exactly why the project was understaffed, the manager said, speculating that it was because American workers were more expensive.The manager said similar Apple jobs in China would include a roomful of people working to ensure that all materials were in place for production. In Texas, it was one worker, who often seemed overwhelmed, the manager said. As a result, materials were regularly out of place or late, contributing to delays.Another frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers won’t work around the clock. Chinese factories have shifts working at all hours, if necessary, and workers are sometimes even roused from their sleep to meet production goals. That was not an option in Texas.“China is not just cheap. It’s a place where, because it’s an authoritarian government, you can marshal 100,000 people to work all night for you,” said Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. “That has become an essential part of the product-rollout strategy.”Ms. Helper said Apple could make more products in the United States if it invested significant time and money and relied more on robotics and specialized engineers instead of large numbers of low-wage line workers. She said government and industry would also need to improve job training and promote the development of a supply-chain infrastructure.But, she added, there is a low chance of all that happening.Apple still assembles Mac Pros at the factory on the outskirts of Austin, in part because it has already invested in complicated and custom machines. But the Mac Pro has been a slow seller, and Apple has not updated it since its introduction in 2013.In December, Apple announced that it would add up to 15,000 workers in Austin, just miles from the Mac Pro plant. None of the new jobs are expected to be in manufacturing."
5c2fc8783a125f5075c02e73,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/china-smartphones-iphone.html,"BEIJING — To most Americans, the names are unfamiliar, maybe a little hard to pronounce: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.They are China’s biggest smartphone brands. Around the world — although not in the United States — they are making the handset business brutally competitive. This week, after Apple warned of disappointing iPhone sales in China, industry observers said that devices from the Chinese brands were a major culprit.As the phone market in China reaches saturation and sales shrink over all, the country’s hardware makers are pushing hard, and increasingly winning fans, in places like France, Germany, India and Southeast Asia, where consumers find that the phones can do just about everything an iPhone can do at a fraction of the cost.Apple sits comfortably atop the market in many countries, including China, for the highest-end handsets. But companies like Huawei have started to do elsewhere what they have done in China, competing with the iPhone on experience and value and luring customers with price comparisons that make them rethink buying Apple’s signature product.The cost difference is notable: In China, an iPhone XR starts at around $950, while Huawei’s top-end handsets start at about $600, and Xiaomi’s comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around $1,250.Companies like Huawei and Oppo have made improvements in features and overall quality that are enticing many wealthy Chinese people, said Mo Jia, an analyst in Shanghai for the technology research firm Canalys. Chinese brands’ aggressive marketing and sales campaigns in Europe indicate that the companies believe consumers there who have traditionally used iPhones will do the same thing.ImageA smartphone retail and repair mall in Beijing. Apple sits atop the Chinese market for the highest-end handsets, but companies like Huawei and Oppo have improved their products in ways that are enticing wealthy Chinese buyers.CreditGilles Sabrié for The New York Times“Maybe it won’t happen this year or next year,” Mr. Jia said. “But Huawei is going in that direction.”In its pursuit of the European market, Huawei (pronounced “HWA-way”), which has its headquarters in Shenzhen and is now the world’s No. 2 seller of smartphones, has gone far beyond the phone store. Huawei has sponsored summer concerts in Greece, teamed up with Lithuania’s basketball federation and backed a “China Festival” in Cologne, Germany. Vivo sponsored last year’s World Cup in Russia.Xiaomi (pronounced “SHAO-mee”), which is based in Beijing and was founded in 2010, seemingly came out of nowhere to become the No. 4 mobile brand in Europe early last year, according to Canalys. The gadget maker has also become the top seller of phones in India, in part by opening hundreds of stores in rural areas.Clément Blaise, a 25-year-old banker in northern France, has an iPhone for work and a Xiaomi as a personal phone. He said he needed to recharge the Apple device “all the time” but could go two days without charging his Xiaomi.“We have this false, preconceived idea that Chinese brands are not as good, that their products are of cheap quality,” Mr. Blaise said. “But the price gap leavens the fears. For 150 euros” — around $170 — “what do you risk anyway?”Chinese phone makers have not made similar inroads in the United States. The American government has worked for years to stymie the sale of Huawei’s smartphones and telecom-network equipment, after a congressional inquiry in 2012 deemed Huawei a potential vehicle for cyberspying by the Chinese government. The Trump administration has urged Western allies to do the same.Security concerns have not dissuaded some buyers across the Atlantic. Giannis Vassilopoulos, a college student in Athens, said he had been bombarded by Huawei ads during his recent travels around Europe. He said he had bought a Huawei phone because the brand felt more familiar, more European even.“Seeing Huawei in the middle of London makes it look immediately more Western,” he said.Apple still has a hold on consumers in many places. Announcing the sales slump in China this week, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said Apple expected to set revenue records in wealthier countries like Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and Spain and in some emerging markets like Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Vietnam.In China, though, Apple’s market share has been declining, and the company is clinging to the No. 5 spot in smartphone shipments, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.China became the world’s largest smartphone market over the past decade as rising incomes coincided with an explosion in mobile technology.People in China rely on handsets in an all-encompassing way, using them to rent bikes, sign into gyms and pay restaurant bills. The market is increasingly saturated, and there are fewer people in China who do not have an advanced device. But there are also new economic reasons to buy locally made goods: Consumers who are replacing or looking to upgrade are dialing back in light of China’s slowdown.Today, mainland China’s top smartphone seller is Huawei, whose handset line includes midrange devices and higher-end models with all the latest features. Vivo and Oppo, brands owned by the same Chinese parent company, are next. And then comes Xiaomi, whose phones, smart home devices and even sneakers command a passionate fan base.Samsung of South Korea, which sells more smartphones globally than any other brand, has only around 1 percent of the market in China.Feng Yin, a 32-year-old engineer, has an iPhone now, but he is considering switching to a Huawei device.ImageMobile phones on sale at Sin Tat Plaza, in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. Chinese phone makers have not made inroads in the United States similar to those they have made elsewhere.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York Times“In the past few years, the technology in Apple’s phones has not had any big breakthroughs, while the technology in domestic phones has gotten better and better,” he said while browsing in a Huawei store in Shanghai on Friday. “The difference is getting smaller.”Apple products have long been seen in China as conferring on their owners the ultimate in cachet and cool. But Chinese companies have used slick marketing and celebrity endorsements in hopes of giving their products more personality, while promoting advances in camera technology, battery life and microchips.On Friday, Xian Longfei, a restaurant chef, and a friend were at an Oppo store in Shanghai. When it comes to cellphone brands, Mr. Xian, 35, has tried many: Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and three different iPhone models. He switched to an Oppo a few months ago.He acknowledges that Apple’s devices still seem better on the whole. But so many of his friends in Shanghai and people in his hometown are Oppo users. And the price — around $400 on sale — was hard to beat.Also, he said, holding up his pink handset, “the form factor is pretty.”Another factor working against Apple in China is the dominance of WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than a billion people. It works on Google’s Android operating system as well as Apple’s, making a phone’s software less of a differentiating factor.“Why would people pay such a high price for an iPhone,” asked Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst for the industry research firm IDC, “if, from a hardware perspective, there isn’t much of an upgrade from Huawei and, from a platform perspective, there’s nothing to lock people in?”In Europe, buyers of Chinese brands describe undergoing a sort of conversion. Irritating flaws in their iPhone or Samsung devices lead them to seek alternatives. Presented with unfamiliar Chinese products, they initially have doubts. But after a while, they get hooked.ImageXiaomi’s flagship store in Mong Kok. The company, which is based in Beijing, became the No. 4 mobile brand in Europe early last year and is the top phone seller in India.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesWhen Alessandro Del Mastro, 33, bought a Huawei handset in southern Italy three years ago, he was skeptical.“My friends teased me that it was not going to last, like most Chinese products, but we were all wrong,” he said.Faruk Kaya uses an Apple iPhone and tablet but, as a salesman at a Berlin electronics store, he encounters German customers who prefer Chinese brands.“Now you can get a smartphone with the best photo and audio quality for about half the price of an iPhone or a Samsung,” he said.Gregory Lauseiro, a telecom executive in Paris, bought his eighth Huawei phone last summer. He has turned his 56-year-old aunt, Christine Jankowski, into a believer, too.“I wasn’t really worried about the fact that it was a Chinese brand,” Ms. Jankowski said of her Huawei phone. She added: “We know that they make amazing technological products.“If I had to buy a Chinese frying pan, I don’t know,” she said. “But a phone?”"
5ca8f08849f0eacbf1f815d2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/right-to-repair-elizabeth-warren-antitrust.html,"A giant John Deere tractor and a pocket-size Apple iPhone have something important in common: The cost of repairing either one is too high.The two companies, and many of their peers, use a variety of aggressive tactics, including electronic locks and restrictive warranties, to push customers with broken equipment to seek help from their authorized repair facilities — or to give up and buy a replacement.This is unfair to consumers who might be able to obtain, or perform, lower-priced repairs. It’s unfair to independent businesses that might do the work. And it’s bad for the environment, because the high cost of repairs leads people to toss devices that might have been fixed.Late last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed a national right-to-repair law for farm equipment. The idea is based on a 2012 Massachusetts law that requires carmakers to provide the information necessary to perform repairs and to sell any special tools needed to do the work. The law also phased in a requirement that new cars be compatible with generic diagnostic tools.Ms. Warren has the right idea, but she did not go far enough. The owners of consumer electronic products deserve the same protection as farmers.The potential savings are considerable. A 2011 study found that customers who used independent auto repair shops spent about 24 percent less on repairs each year. Similarly, Apple charges $279 to fix the screen of an iPhone X, while a repair store in downtown Washington, D.C., quoted a price of $219 — although the lack of Apple support makes such repairs riskier. “Right-to-repair” is a bit of a misnomer. The owner of a device generally has the legal right to repair it. The issue is whether the manufacturer allows people and independent businesses to obtain the necessary information, tools and parts to do the repairs.Until recently, cars, tractors and even most consumer electronic products were relatively easy to fix, without any help or permission from the manufacturer. Parents taught their children to make basic auto repairs; teenagers built their own computers.The growing complexity of electronic devices, however, means that people need help from manufacturers. And companies have taken advantage of that shift in power.Some obstacles are passive. Companies can impede people from repairing modern electronic devices simply by declining to publish the necessary schematics.Companies also take active measures to discourage tinkering. Like many modern machines, John Deere’s tractors are a marriage of mechanical and electronic technology. And the company requires replacement parts to be verified electronically — a process akin to clearing passport control.In addition to the high cost of repairs, farmers complain about having to wait for a certified technician during harvest season, when every minute of daylight is precious.Apple and John Deere both have made some concessions. Apple no longer threatens to void phone warranties if screens are repaired by other companies. Last year it paid to install screen-repair machinery at 30 stores owned by an independent retailer, Simply Mac, in parts of the country not previously served by authorized Apple technicians. Deere has agreed to offer its manuals and diagnostic software for sale by 2021.There is still a clear need for a national and enforceable standard.The Federal Trade Commission is showing interest in the issue, and plans to hold a hearing in July on “Nixing the Fix: A Workshop on Repair Restrictions.”But solving the issue may not require national legislation. After Massachusetts passed its auto repair law in 2012, major carmakers agreed to nationalize those standards in a signed agreement with trade groups representing independent auto repair shops.A single state law could prove a dam buster for other kinds of products, too. Information and parts available in one state, after all, are effectively available in every state.Legislators in 20 states have introduced some version of right-to-repair legislation this year. The front-runner is a bill in Minnesota, where similar legislation has been proposed for several years. This bill is expected to reach the floor of the Minnesota House this month.Apple and John Deere, among other companies, have lobbied vigorously, and so far with success, against proposals for state right-to-repair laws. Companies say that they are seeking to ensure the quality of repairs, protecting both their customers and their own reputations.They also have raised more sensational concerns. Lydia Brasch, a Nebraska state senator who proposed such a law in 2017, said an Apple lobbyist warned her that Nebraska would become a hot spot for hackers, and that it was dangerous to play with lithium batteries. The company is welcome to persuade people to patronize its own repair facilities, or to buy new iPhones. But there ought to be a law against forcing the issue. An open marketplace for repairs benefits consumers, independent retailers and the environment. Modern devices are increasingly complicated; that concept is not.More on the right to repair.Your iPhone Slowed Down.

5c50f3bf3a125f5075c06feb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/facetime-glitch-apple.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — On Jan. 19, Grant Thompson, a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected discovery: Using FaceTime, Apple’s video chatting software, he could eavesdrop on his friend’s phone before his friend had even answered the call.His mother, Michele Thompson, sent a video of the hack to Apple the next day, warning the company of a “major security flaw” that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didn’t hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing and faxing Apple’s security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Apple’s product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.But it wasn’t until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on 9to5mac.com, a news site for Apple fans, in an article that went viral.The bug, and Apple’s slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company’s commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple’s statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, tweeted that “we all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.”The FaceTime problem has already been branded “FacePalm” by security researchers, who say Apple’s security team should have known better. Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before that person answers the phone, or even if the person never answers.“If these kinds of bugs are slipping through,” said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, “you have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.”[Read how to disable FaceTime to avoid the eavesdropping bug.]On Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had “identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.”But the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Ms. Thompson’s urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.A bug this easy to exploit is every company’s worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker’s dream. In emails to Apple’s product security team, Ms. Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.“My fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes,” she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. “Although this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw.”ImageApple has disabled Group FaceTime and is working on a fix to be released in a software update this week.CreditAndy Wong/Associated PressUnknown to Ms. Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponize them, which allow governments, defense contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on people’s devices without their knowledge, capturing everything from their locations to information caught on their microphones and cameras. The FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever higher sums to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.The only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.The market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker and security firm, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to $2 million.In part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty program in 2016 — the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.At a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as $200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty program has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.The FacePalm bug is a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.“This is a bug that Apple’s Q.A., should have caught,” Mr. Wardle said. “And where there’s smoke, there’s almost always fire.”Bug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.Bugs that fetch $2 million or $3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 percent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive of Netragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.In this case, Mr. Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone’s location, turn on that person’s camera and capture video without a trace.But, he added, “it’s pretty good for a high schooler.”"

Yet we can never go back to before. What we can do is to find more balance between human and digital relationships. A number of scientific articles demonstrate that these ubiquitous and ever-available devices are now getting in the way of quality time with our children and our friends. Even tweens think so. And a very recent study suggests that just having the phone in the same room divides our attention.Maybe it is time to hide the iPhone in a cubbyhole, at least when we are having dinner or going to a meeting. This might allow us to preserve the best part of yesteryear without throwing out Siri with the bath water.Kathy Hirsh-PasekArdmore, Pa.The writer, a fellow in psychology at Temple University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a co-author of “Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children.”"
5c30802d3a125f5075c02f55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/technology/apple-iphone-replacement-mom.html,"When Apple lost more than $75 billion in market value this past week after a surprise announcement that it is expecting lower iPhone sales than originally projected, the company put most of the blame for its troubles on China, where a slowing economy and the trade war with the United States have hurt sales.But a bigger issue for Apple might exist much closer to home, in a small, leafy town in Ohio.That’s where my mom lives. She’s a relatively tech-savvy retiree and a longtime Apple fan who has used many of the company’s products over the years. I learned to type on an Apple IIGS at her office, and she was an early adopter of the original turquoise iMac. These days, she uses her iPhone to check Facebook and Instagram, talk with her friends and relatives, and play solitaire and Words With Friends.Her phone isn’t the latest model — it’s a three-year-old iPhone 6S — and it’s missing some of the latest features. She can’t take portrait mode photos using a dual-lens camera, a feature introduced in the iPhone 7 Plus, and she can’t unlock her phone using Face ID, which was introduced in the iPhone X in 2017. Her phone’s battery life could be better, and the device sometimes runs out of storage space.But she’s happy with it, and doesn’t feel the need to upgrade. She also has a first-generation Apple Watch and a several-versions-ago MacBook Air, neither of which she’s planning to replace anytime soon.“The phone I have does just about everything I need,” she said when I called her to ask why she hadn’t upgraded to one of the newer models. “Why pay $800 for a new one just to be up to date? My needs aren’t that complicated.”Most of the journalists who write about tech for a living (including me) are early adopters — power users who like having the latest gadgets, and who are willing to fork over money for a slightly better experience. For some of these people, Apple’s announcement has come as a shock that portends potential disaster for the company.But for my mom, and the many people who are probably in her situation, the company’s slowing iPhone sales aren’t at all a disaster. In fact, they make total sense, and they don’t have much to do with China.In a letter to investors explaining the lower forecast, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, nodded to smaller-than-expected demand for iPhone upgrades, saying that consumers were “adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies” and “taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.” The company declined to comment for this column.Apple is also facing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei, which have flooded international markets with lower-cost Androids that are, in many cases, just as functional as iPhones. And, yes, there are issues related to President Trump’s trade war with China, and an overall economic slowdown in the country.But the most consequential hit to Apple’s bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replaced after roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.ImageAn Apple store in Beijing. With new iPhones costing more than ever, “we’re going to move to longer replacement cycles,” said Chris Caso, a tech analyst with Raymond James.CreditGilles Sabrie for The New York Times“We’re going to move to longer replacement cycles, principally because the cost is higher,” said Chris Caso, a tech analyst with Raymond James.Many of Apple’s issues are common to smartphone makers. The components inside newer phones, such as added memory and improved screen technology, are more expensive than older components. Refurbished and used phones are also more easily available, and carriers like Verizon and AT&T aren’t subsidizing new phone purchases as heavily as they once did, meaning that the up-front cost to the customer is higher.“It used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,” Mr. Caso said. “Now, to put more features in the phone, it costs money.”There are Apple-specific variables, too. The newest version of Apple’s mobile operating systems, iOS 12, was designed to improve the performance of older devices. (This was a refreshing change from previous iOS updates, which tended to grind older models to a halt.) With better water resistance and sturdier screens, iPhones are more physically resilient than they used to be. And the list of must-have new features has shrunk. With a few exceptions — like Face ID and animated emojis — there is nothing you can do on a new iPhone that you can’t do on one from several years ago.Apple has also taken a hit from its battery replacement program, which offered steep discounts to many customers after the company was accused of slowing down older iPhones. That led some users to replace their batteries rather than their entire iPhone.All of this is worrying short-term investors, who want people to buy as many new iPhones as possible. But it’s great for people like my mom, who get to keep phones they’re happy with and replace them less frequently. It’s great for the environment — according to Apple’s latest sustainability report, each new Apple device produced generates an average of 90 kilograms of carbon emissions.A more durable iPhone could even be great for Apple’s long-term profitability. As Brian Barrett points out at Wired, “An iPhone that lasts longer keeps customers in the iOS ecosystem longer,” and more willing to keep their paid subscriptions to Apple Music, iCloud and other Apple services.Apple’s longer replacement cycle may be a temporary phenomenon, if newer technologies — such as compatibility with 5G mobile networks, which is expected to arrive in iPhones in 2020 — lead to popular apps that don’t run on older phones.“If there’s an app — maybe it’s Fortnite 2 — that I can’t run on my existing iPhone, a new iPhone will be on every teenage boy’s shopping list,” Mr. Caso said.But for now, while investors might be unhappy with the company’s short-term sales, the rest of us should cheer it as a sign of progress in giving customers what they want: sturdy, reliable phones that don’t become obsolete as soon as a new model arrives.When I asked my mom what would get her to upgrade to a newer iPhone, she said she might do it if a new, killer feature came along, or if her favorite apps no longer worked. But in the end, she admitted that wasn’t likely.“Until I drop it and break it, I’ll probably keep it,” she said."
5ca67a4349f0eacbf1f80ff2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/smarter-living/tap-less-phone-voice-assistant-shortcuts.html,"When Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone in 2007, he dissed the tiny keyboards on rival smartphones. “They can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product,” he told the audience. “We’re gonna get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen.”That design decision eventually opened Pandora’s container ship: the teeming world of full-screen, touch-sensitive apps.Yes, eliminating the keys and buttons left a bigger canvas for displaying apps. But it also eliminated the keys and buttons. As a result, almost every smartphone task now requires tapping on glass. Typing text, correcting errors. Entering numbers, correcting errors. Changing settings, correcting errors.Over the years, Apple and Google have put enormous effort into reducing the tap tally for tedious tasks. With each software update, we get more features that streamline the steps.Unless you’re a hard-core geek, though, you may not have had time to keep up with them. Here are five ways to get things done more efficiently on your phone — to tap less and smile more.Set up self-expanding abbreviationsYou probably do a lot of repetitive typing on your tiny onscreen keyboard. You enter your contact information into one website after another. You reply to dozens of emails. You text stock phrases like “Got it — thanks” or “On my way!”Fortunately, you can set up short, quick-to-type text abbreviations (like ph) that type out much longer expressions (“Here’s my number: 212 718-2034”).To set up these shortcuts, begin like this:iPhone: Tap Settings, then General, Keyboard, Text Replacement.Android: Open Settings, then Language & Input. From here, the navigation depends on your phone model and Android version; you’re looking for Personal Dictionary. Getting there might involve tapping things like System, Advanced, Virtual Keyboard or Dictionary. (Some keyboards offer no text expansion at all.)In either case, when you tap +, you see boxes for both the phrase you want typed and the abbreviation (called Shortcut on the iPhone). Fill them in, tap Save and then try out your new tap-saving device in any app.You might set up addr to type out your street address, apm for “Airplane mode! See you when I touch down,” ily for “I love you” and so on. The best part: You never have to correct the typing.ImageBoth iOS (left) and Android let you create self-expanding abbreviations for common phrases.Give your voice assistant another shotYou’re forgiven if you’ve abandoned the dictation features of Siri or Google Assistant. Text-to-speech is still an imperfect technology.But the other function of these voice assistants — executing tasks — is far more reliable, and you’re probably not using it enough.Here’s your homework for the week: Adopt five new voice commands. Set your next alarm with “Wake me at 7:30 a.m.,” which saves seven taps. Avoid fumbling in the dark by saying “Turn on the flashlight” (two taps). Saying, “Text Casey that I’m running 15 minutes late” saves about 24 taps, and “What’s my next appointment?” saves a few more.It’s also worth learning to say, “Do not disturb” as you enter a movie theater, a meeting or your bed.Make a home screen bookmarkTo open a website, you usually tap to open your phone’s browser, tap for your list of bookmarks, then tap the bookmark you want. Or, worse, you painstakingly type in the web address.But you can also create bookmark “app” icons on your home screen that require only a single tap to open.To create one, open the web page. Then:iPhone: Tap the Share button (bottom center of the screen). Scroll the bottom row of icons until you can tap “Add to Home Screen.”Android: Tap the Menu button at the upper-right corner, which looks like three stacked dots. Tap “Add to Home screen.”ImageHere’s the process for turning any web page into an “app” icon on your Home screen, shown on iPhone (left) and Android.In either case, edit the icon’s name, if you like, and then tap Add. From now on, getting to your favorite site requires only a single sloppy tap.Squeeze for silenceWhen your phone rings at a bad moment — at a movie, for example, or in church — don’t extend the embarrassment by pulling it out and fumbling for the Ignore button.Instead, just reach into your pocket or purse and squeeze the phone. Pressing any button on the edge of the phone means “Silence the ringing, stop the shame” — and when you grasp the phone this way, you’ll hit one of those buttons in a hurry.Customize your controlsToday’s smartphones are almost ridiculously customizable. A typical iPhone’s Settings app contains over 11,000 options. (How do I know? While you were out having a life, I counted.)To avoid swimming through that sea of settings, you can summon a subset screen of Settings shortcuts. Swipe in from the bottom or top of the screen to see these important controls, like Brightness, Volume and Airplane Mode. On Android, swipe down from the top and you’ll get a similar selection, just above your notifications.But who says those are your most important controls? Maybe you, as an infrequent flier, have no use for Airplane Mode at all. Maybe you’d rather install a different button in its place.Fortunately, you can (and should) edit this panel, so that the settings you need often are there at your fingertips.iPhone: Tap Settings, Control Center, Customize Controls. In the list of options, the plus signs mean “add this button” and the minus signs mean “remove it.” Drag them (using the right-side handle) to reorder them.Android: Swipe down twice from the top of the screen and then tap the pencil button or the Edit button. On this screen, you can rearrange the Settings buttons by dragging. See the “Hold and drag to add tiles” area at the bottom? If you touch one of these extra buttons until the phone vibrates, you can then drag upward to install it onto the Quick Settings panel. Conversely, if you touch-until-vibrate on one of the currently installed buttons, a “Drag here to remove it” area appears at the bottom.It’s worth the effort. Every time you go hunting for a setting, you’re wasting time and taps.ImageOn both iPhone (left) and Android, you can customize the quick settings screen.Automate everything elseYou can save even more steps by setting up macros: multistep sequences you can trigger with a single command, even a spoken one. They can be as simple as “Take a picture!” to snap a photo hands-free, or as complex as “Let’s roll” to make the phone play a certain playlist, speak your arrival time at work and your first appointment, and get directions based on current traffic.The latest iPhone software version, iOS 12, comes with canned, ready-to-use macros — called Shortcuts — just for this purpose. Tap Settings, Siri & Search and then All Shortcuts to see them: “Get directions to [your home address],” for example, and “Record a new voice memo.”If you spot a shortcut that looks useful, tap it to record a spoken Siri command that triggers it.If you’re even slightly technically inclined, you can download Apple’s free Shortcuts app and construct your own shortcuts from scratch. These can be far more elaborate — and useful.I made one that texts my most recent photo to my wife when I say “Hey Siri, send that to Nicki.” I use it constantly, which I’m sure she appreciates.A sampling of other shortcuts you can build:“Hush now.” Turns on Do Not Disturb until you leave your current location. “Call in.” The phone checks your calendar for your next conference call and then dials the number automatically. “What’s happening?” Displays the headlines from the News app. “Back it out.” For Tesla owners only. The car turns on and carefully self-drives out of its parking place. It’s perfect when some idiot has boxed you in too tightly to open your door.Apple offers a complete user guide for the Shortcut app here and the web is full of suggestions and sources for even more amazing Shortcuts.Similar apps offer the same idea on Android phones, like AutomateIt (free) and Tasker ($3).Fewer taps, brighter futureEach of these tactics requires a small investment in setup and learning time. But in the long run, you’ll save time, eliminate glass-tapping and delay the inevitable loss of your fingerprints."
5ca4767449f0eacbf1f80793,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/technology/personaltech/apple-airpods-review.html,"Apple’s new AirPods, those tiny wireless earbuds that look like Q-Tips dangling from your ears, are some of the coolest audio accessories you can buy today.Just insert the buds into your ears and they work instantly and seamlessly with your iPhone. When you are done using them, pop them into a white case that replenishes their power. They are sleek, innovative and convenient. I could go on, but this is where the gushing stops. That’s because AirPods have a finite life. That means you will probably have to buy new ones every few years, as if they were a good pair of shoes.Here’s how I know: After I bought Apple’s first-generation AirPods in late 2016, they became my favorite headset for taking phone calls and listening to podcasts. Their lack of wires made moving around easier, avoiding a mess of tangled cords. I haven’t once considered reverting to wired headphones.But about a month ago, my AirPods started dying. Their batteries, which are not replaceable by users, no longer last more than 30 minutes when I am on a phone call; they used to have enough juice for two hours of talk time. Other AirPod owners have recently shared similar complaints.The second-generation AirPods, which were released last week, may face a similar fate. That’s because their minimalist design involves embedding the batteries, circuit boards, microphones and antennas directly into the tiny earpieces. Then they are sealed up, making it impossible for us to open them to replace the batteries. There are some improvements. The new AirPods have slightly longer battery life and give you the ability to pick songs from an iPhone hands-free by speaking the command “Hey, Siri.” Yet this is a tough product to recommend for people who are slow to adopt new technology or who are environmentally conscious. While you can spend about $160 (or $200 for a version that includes a special case that can be charged wirelessly) for the new AirPods, you have to be prepared to shell out that amount again when their batteries inevitably wear out. Good wired earphones — which can cost less than $50 — last indefinitely, so long as you don’t rip the cords.So what’s right for you? Take a look below to decide.What’s new about the AirPodsThe new AirPods look virtually identical to the previous generation. The charging case resembles a white dental floss container. There are three batteries: one inside each earbud and one inside the case. When the charging case eventually runs out of juice, you can plug in Apple’s Lightning cable, the same wire used to charge iPhones.The $200 version of the AirPods includes a new case that can be charged wirelessly. That means you can place the case on a wireless charging pad, which uses an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, creating voltage that powers up the case. This method relieves the Lightning port of eventual wear and tear. The new case worked well with several wireless charging pads I tested. But because you will have to spend about $20 on a charging pad, I recommend buying the AirPods with the special case only if you already own other devices that support wireless charging, like newer iPhones. Like the first-generation AirPods, the new ones last about five hours when you listen to music. But for phone calls, they can now go about three hours, up from two hours previously. When you return the earbuds to the case, it has enough juice to recharge them multiple times; as a result, you will get about 24 hours of listening time before having to replenish the case. Over a week of testing, I recharged the case only once. The audio quality of the new earbuds is about the same as the first generation’s. Music sounds O.K. through them, good enough for playing podcasts and songs on your commute. But if you want wireless earphones that sound louder and richer with deeper bass, consider earbuds from Jabra or some of the other recommendations from Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times. The AirPods also include a new chip that lets people use them to interact with Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant. To summon the assistant, you say, “Hey, Siri,” followed by a command like “Play some music” or “Schedule meeting for 3 p.m. on Thursday.” While that’s a neat feature for tasks like adding items to your calendar, I couldn’t get in the habit of talking to Siri via AirPods — especially in public, where I still occasionally get dirty looks from people just for wearing the earbuds.ImageThe new AirPods look virtually identical to the last ones. They come in a charging case that resembles a white dental floss container.CreditCayce Clifford for The New York TimesApple’s battery programWhen the day the AirPods’ batteries are depleted eventually comes, you can take them to an Apple store and pay for battery servicing. The cost for battery servicing is $49 per earbud and $49 for the case, for a grand total of $147. At that point, you might as well buy a new pair.Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and offers guides for repairing electronics, has tried to pry open the new AirPods to see whether he could replace the batteries. He concluded that removing the batteries was impossible without destroying the gadget, which is a contraption of tiny circuit boards and ribbon cables soldered together.He added that Apple probably wasn’t capable of replacing AirPod batteries, either, when consumers take them in for servicing. That means people are most likely getting new AirPods in exchange for their old ones.“There’s no way Apple’s replacing batteries in these things,” Mr. Wiens said. “It can’t be done.”An Apple spokeswoman didn’t comment on whether the company was replacing batteries for AirPods or just giving people new ones. But one thing is certain: Maintaining AirPods isn’t easy compared with maintaining an iPhone, which you can take to Apple or a third-party repair shop to get a fresh battery or a new screen for relatively little cost. Do things have to be this way?Apple’s AirPods create a moral conundrum. Should you buy these earphones knowing that you will probably have to buy new ones every few years? In the process, you would essentially be using up energy, metals, plastics and human labor invested in creating the product.The AirPods reminded me of Tile, the company that offers Bluetooth trackers to help find items like house keys, luggage and wallets. In the past, the trackers were tightly sealed, making the batteries impractical to replace. When a Tile device was nearly a year old, the company would send an email warning that it would soon be time to “reTile,” or buy a new Tile. Using Tile thus felt more like a subscription service than ownership. After two years of this routine, I stopped buying Tiles.But the company recently made a big change: It started selling trackers with replaceable batteries. Simon Fleming-Wood, Tile’s chief experience officer, said that over time, the company had realized that the reTile process was angering people.“People didn’t realize that these Tiles died until they started hearing from us after 11 months that it was time to start replacing their Tiles,” he said. “When people realized that was part of the deal, some people had very negative reactions to that.”He added that the company was betting that by making the batteries easier to replace, customers would remain loyal to the brand.I hope Apple makes a similar change with AirPods. I asked the company whether the AirPods had to have irreplaceable batteries to achieve its design. Apple didn’t have an answer.The upshot: As someone who enjoys maintaining electronics for as long as possible before upgrading, I’m on the fence about springing for the latest AirPods. The fact that my first-generation ones have such shortened battery life after two years gives me pause about buying a new pair.But there are people who enthusiastically buy a new smartphone, tablet or computer as soon as they come out, year after year. The AirPods are perfect for them.Related Coverage How to Sell or Recycle Old ElectronicsDec. 2, 2015Choosing to Skip the Upgrade and Care for the Gadget You’ve GotApril 20, 2016How to Choose the Best Wireless HeadphonesOct. 3, 2017"
5c50c5e13a125f5075c06f67,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/apple-earnings-china.html,"Apple said on Tuesday that profits were flat and revenues were down in its most recent quarter, indicating a difficult road ahead for a company that five months ago became the first American firm to be valued above $1 trillion.The disappointing financial performance had been expected since Jan. 2, when Apple, for the first time in 16 years, revised its forecast for the quarter because of an economic slowdown in China and diminishing demand for new iPhones.Now, after years of expansion and record-setting profits, Apple appears to be entering a period of vulnerability. While it has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, the company has not found another product with the global impact of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago. Apple is also uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.Apple’s stock price is down a third since its peak last summer, and now it is worth less than several of its longtime rivals in the tech industry.Apple could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China — something President Trump has threatened to do. The bulk of Apple’s products are made in Chinese factories.There are also new concerns about a security flaw in the iPhone. On Monday, Apple customers said an iPhone user could call someone else who had an iPhone and listen in on that person’s conversations through the device’s microphone — even if the recipient did not answer the call. The problem was the result of a bug involving Apple’s FaceTime app. The company promised to have a fix by the end of the week.Apple’s total revenue for the quarter was $84.3 billion, a 5 percent drop from a year earlier and in line with the revised forecast earlier this month.Sales of iPhones, following a global trend for smartphones, have been leveling off for several years. Their revenue was $51.98 billion, a 15 percent drop from a year earlier. It’s harder now to offer more specifics on iPhone sales because Apple recently stopped disclosing how many units it sells each quarter.Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that sales had slumped largely because current iPhone owners were waiting longer to upgrade their devices, a trend that has continued into the current quarter. He blamed fewer subsidies from wireless carriers, a strengthening United States dollar and cheaper battery upgrades that consumers have used to extend the lives of their old phones.Apple has attributed some of its issues in China to a trade war with the United States. And there is concern that some Chinese customers are shying away from Apple products out of national pride, particularly since the authorities in the United States brought charges against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Prosecutors cited a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran.“We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said this month.But some data suggest Apple faces more fundamental problems with its business in China. Chinese consumers appear to be opting for less expensive but similar smartphones from Chinese makers, particularly Huawei. Some of Apple’s latest phones top $1,000, far above the typical cost for its Chinese competitors.Total sales in the region that includes China were down 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. Outside China, revenues increased slightly.“We’ve actually seen the economic situation in China continue to deteriorate over the course of the quarter,” Mr. Maestri said. “From mid-November onwards, we’ve seen a deceleration of economic activity in China.”But he added that Apple had recovered some business by cutting prices in China for the iPhone XR, the lowest-priced new iPhone, to offset the strengthening dollar. Apple declined to disclose the exact size of the price cut.Mr. Cook said in a call with financial analysts that he believed the iPhone’s high price had hurt sales in emerging markets, and that Apple had dropped prices in a number of them.Apple made up for tepid iPhone sales in the quarter with 19 percent revenue growth in other areas. The wearables category, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, led the way with a 33 percent increase to $7.3 billion.Apple’s earnings per share were $4.18 in the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations by a penny. Apple’s overall profit was down 0.5 percent to $19.97 billion.Apple’s struggles appear to be continuing. The company said it expected between $55 billion and $59 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below analysts’ expectations for $59 billion.Apple’s share price was up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading after its results were announced on Tuesday."

Late Wednesday it reduced its revenue forecast for its most recent quarter because of a significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China.Apple’s stock fell 10 percent on Thursday, its worst one-day slide in six years. But the warning also rippled across its many suppliers.The chip makers Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 percent and 9 percent. Qorvo, a maker of radio frequency chips, and Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone, dropped 9 percent.Lumentum, which supplies optical components for the iPhone, slid 8 percent. AMS, a maker of light sensors for smartphones, tumbled more than 20 percent.Since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, the market for mobile phones has become saturated. Even before Apple’s warning — its first in 16 years — investors had started to grow worried about the company’s ability to sell more phones.That’s partly because Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Lumentum and AMS had all already cut their revenue forecasts for the most recent quarter late last year. Though none of the companies mentioned Apple, the tech giant is the largest customer for each.Those announcements weighed heavily on Apple’s stock. Over a three-day period in mid-November, Apple’s stock fell 9 percent after the warnings of Qorvo, Lumentum and AMS."
5c545c283a125f5075c078ea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/technology/facetime-bug-fixed.html,"Apple said Friday that it had fixed a security flaw in iPhones that allowed people to call another iPhone via FaceTime and listen in on conversations even if the recipient didn’t answer, resolving an alarming vulnerability that undermined the company’s public commitment to security. A software update will be released next week, the company said.The new update will allow owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to re-enable Group FaceTime, the feature that had allowed the potential eavesdropping, Apple said. (Instructions on how to update a device’s software are below.)Apple’s response came four days after the flaw was widely reported, and nearly two weeks since a concerned customer alerted the company. This week, before fixing the bug, the company raced to disable Group FaceTime, which allows people to video chat with several people.A 14-year-old Arizona boy discovered that he could listen to a friend via Group FaceTime on Jan. 19, even if the friend didn’t answer the call. His mother repeatedly tried to flag the issue to Apple, but the company was slow to respond.“We want to assure our customers that as soon as our engineering team became aware of the details necessary to reproduce the bug, they quickly disabled Group FaceTime and began work on the fix,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement Friday. “We are committed to improving the process by which we receive and escalate these reports, in order to get them to the right people as fast as possible.”The incident was embarrassing for a company that regularly boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple publicly acknowledged the bug — branded “FacePalm” by security researchers — on Monday, Timothy D. Cook, the company’s chief executive, tweeted that “we all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.”After the vulnerability became public, security researchers and politicians raised concerns about the security of Apple’s products. To pre-empt security attacks, in 2016 Apple started offering hackers a $200,000 bounty if they flagged bugs to the company. But some hackers have said the program has had a slow start because they can make more money selling the flaws on the black market.To install the update when it is released, follow these steps for iPhones, iPads and Macs:■ On an iPhone or an iPad, open the Settings app, then tap General and then tap Software Update. From here, download the newest iOS version, which is expected to be called 12.1.4. When the update is ready, choose Install Now. As a precaution, make sure your iPhone or iPad is plugged into a power source when installing the update.■ On a Mac, open the App Store app. Then click the Updates tab, and click Update next to MacOS Mojave. (If you are using an older version of the Mac operating system, you will not see this option and do not need to download the update.) When the download is finished, make sure your power cable is plugged in and restart the computer."
5c5399293a125f5075c076f9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/technology/apple-blocks-facebook.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Facebook employees woke up on Wednesday morning, many found they could not perform even the most basic work tasks.Their calendars were not working. Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook’s latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company’s cafeterias were serving for lunch.That’s because those features run on Facebook’s internal, custom-built iPhone apps — and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The situation stemmed from a dispute after Facebook violated Apple’s rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users’ online activity. When Apple discovered the transgression this week, it revoked Facebook’s special access to apps and updates that run on its iPhone software.That immediately cut off Facebook’s 35,000 workers from its internal iPhone apps. And the problem snowballed when mobile apps like Workplace and Messenger — two internal communication tools — also stopped working, frustrating employees and resulting in hours of lost productivity.Late Thursday, Apple relented and restored Facebook’s access. Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world. While Facebook is the world’s biggest social network, Apple controls the distribution of apps — including Facebook’s — on its phones. That power is a longstanding concern for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, making his company beholden to the rules of others.The spat underscored the tensions between two of Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies, which have competed for years over talent and new technologies. Recently, each has taken potshots at the other over data privacy, with Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, trading slights with Mr. Zuckerberg in interviews. Facebook also worked last year with a public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to urge reporters to scrutinize Apple and other tech companies. And Apple has made changes to some of its tech features that limit the ability of Facebook and others to track users.Apple did not immediately have a comment on Thursday after reinstating Facebook’s access to its internal apps. In a statement, Facebook said it was “getting our internal apps up and running” and added, “To be clear, this didn’t have an impact on our consumer-facing services.”In an interview on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said of the dispute with Apple, “Obviously we want to be in full compliance with all of our partners.” She added that the Facebook research app at issue hadn’t been a secret and had been operated only with its users’ consent.Apple also briefly demonstrated its power on Thursday with another Silicon Valley giant, Google. Like Facebook, Google had violated Apple’s rules by publicly distributing an app, Screenwise Meter, through a special Apple developer program. The internet search company said some of its internal apps that run on iPhone software were temporarily disrupted.Two Google employees, who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak publicly on the matter, said iPhone apps for internal services like hailing a bus or viewing cafeteria information were not working. In addition, apps testing unreleased updates of Google products such as Gmail and Google Maps were unavailable, these people said. The disruptions were earlier reported by the technology website The Verge.A Google spokeswoman, Suzanne Blackburn, said in a statement that the company expected the issue to be resolved “soon.” A spokesman for Apple, Tom Neumayr, said it was working with Google to reinstate access “very quickly.” He declined to comment on whether Apple had revoked Google’s access or if it was a technical glitch.ImageEmployees at Facebook, which is led by Mark Zuckerberg, regained use of their custom company apps late Thursday, a day after Apple shut the apps down.CreditStephen Lam/ReutersApple’s dispute with Facebook this week was rooted in the social network’s practice of scooping up information on its users’ practices, a way for it to gain insight into their digital habits so it can improve products to keep consumers regularly coming back to its site.In 2013, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli company that collected information on how customers used every app on their phones. Onavo’s findings helped Facebook executives predict which apps were rising and trending across App Stores.That gave Mr. Zuckerberg, who colleagues have said was highly dependent on the data, the foresight to try to buy Snapchat long before it went public. Although that effort failed, Facebook has built products, like live video streams and group video chat, based on information gleaned from Onavo’s app.Last year, Apple updated some of its privacy policies and forced Facebook to remove Onavo’s app from its App Store. But Onavo had other ways of collecting consumer data that bypassed some of Apple’s restrictions.In 2016, the Onavo team had created a research app that vacuumed up all of a user’s phone and web activity; Facebook paid people ages 13 to 35 to install it. Then Facebook distributed the app under an Apple program with a special approval process if apps are used only for internal testing.On Tuesday, the technology news site TechCrunch published a report detailing Facebook’s research app and its public use, which violated the rules of Apple’s program. Facebook immediately pushed back on privacy concerns and said it was not tricking users with the research app.“There was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App,” Arielle Argyres, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. “It wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate.”She added that fewer than 5 percent of users in the research program were teenagers and that all had obtained signed parental consent forms.But Facebook had no comeback for sidestepping Apple’s rules. On Wednesday morning, Apple revoked Facebook’s “enterprise developer certificate” and paralyzed the social giant from deploying its internal iPhone apps.“Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple,” Tammy Levine, an Apple spokeswoman, said at the time. “Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.”Apple has been dealing with its own privacy problems. This week, a bug was discovered in its FaceTime app, whereby people could spy on the video and audio FaceTime calls of other users. Apple has pledged to fix the problem by the end of this week.After Apple’s revocation, employees inside Facebook became furious with the Onavo team, according to four people familiar with the company’s deliberations. Some said they would have to wait weeks to get app updates or changes approved through Apple’s App Store. Several employees in Facebook’s hardware division said they were considering quitting because they could not get any work done.Late Thursday, after Apple relented, Facebook employees began seeing the next day’s lunch menu again, as well as their calendars and their shuttle bus schedules. Still, they said, Apple had made its point."
5c2fd3e23a125f5075c02e8b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-china.html,"Do not pity Timothy D. Cook. He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apple’s chief executive. He is regarded as one of business’s best bosses, and runs a company with a beloved brand and $130 billion in cash. Even so, he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple’s corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons:1. His bet on China may be backfiring. The signature innovation of Apple’s late co-founder, Mr. Jobs, was the iPhone. Mr. Cook’s has been his ability to crack the Chinese market. That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass $1 trillion in market value by August last year.But now it might be backfiring. The Chinese economy is sputtering, and the trade war between the United States and China isn’t getting much better. With most adults — even children — in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones, Apple has relied on China to keep growing. On Wednesday, Mr. Cook announced a potential drop of 25 percent in sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apple’s competitors.Apple’s share price dropped nearly 10 percent on Thursday, but bounced back about 4 percent on Friday.2. People are sticking with their old iPhones. People aren’t buying iPhones the way they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors. The problem is, many people aren’t. Mr. Cook said this week that customers were waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fueled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.That presents a dilemma for Mr. Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apple’s business. But the ugly truth might be: Longer-lasting iPhones are bad for business.3. President Trump knows where iPhones are made. Apple’s sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of history’s most popular products. And Mr. Cook, who was Apple’s operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.But it soon might be in the cross hairs of President Trump. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China — and Mr. Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying he’d force it to start making its products closer to home. While president, he has said Apple plans “to build a lot of plants” in the United States — even though it hasn’t announced plans to do so. (Mr. Cook hasn’t publicly corrected him.)While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Mr. Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China’s scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world’s most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.Cozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple’s employees in liberal Silicon Valley — even some of its customers. So far, Mr. Cook has walked a fine line, holding cordial private meetings with Mr. Trump while also publicly criticizing his policies, without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employees.On Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United States.“Don’t forget this: Apple makes their product in China,” he said. “I told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot: ‘Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.’”He went on to say China, not the United States, gets the biggest benefit from Apple. “They build their product mostly in China.”ImageOutside an Apple store in Beijing. Until recently, the Chinese market was a major source of growth in iPhone sales. CreditGilles Sabrié for The New York Times4. Apple has clammed up on iPhone unit sales.Two months ago, Mr. Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apple’s earnings call: The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sold. “The number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,” he reasoned.Apple had reported the metric for years, highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales. But those sales have leveled off over the last two quarters. In an earnings call at the end of January, Mr. Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing. How much? That will be up to people outside the company to figure out. Investors were displeased — even before the surprise news about sales in China. Apple’s shares have since dropped more than 30 percent, shaving $380 billion off its market value. The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than longtime rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent company.5. Innovation is hard to do over and over again.Mr. Jobs presided over a historic run of innovation in his second tour at Apple, from the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. In his seven years as chief executive, Mr. Cook has announced the Apple Watch and AirPods, which have done well but have been far from iPhone-like industry changers.So what’s next? That is Mr. Cook’s biggest challenge.Apple has been working on artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology — but most industry insiders believe it is way behind competitors like Alphabet. Then there is the world of digital health, where Apple would face intense regulations and bureaucracy. Or maybe Apple will try to build glasses that overlay a digital interface on what people see. That technology, called augmented reality, faces enormous technical hurdles — as well as the challenge of getting people to wear a computer on their face. Think of a (hopefully) stylish version of Google’s oft-mocked Google Glass.Whatever he does, Mr. Cook faces enormous expectations. It takes a lot to fuel growth at a company that had $265.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.The Apple Watch dominates the market for wearable technology and would be a smash hit for any other company. For Apple? Watches have been counted in the “other products” category in financial results."
5c5175b23a125f5075c070f3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/personaltech/save-next-apple-purchase.html,"Gadgets like Apple’s iPhone have become so powerful and durable that you can wait many years before buying a new one. The bad news is that your next upgrade will probably cost a lot more.Consider that last year, Apple raised prices for most of its products. They included its iPhones, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, MacBook Air and iPad Pro. (Yes, that is nearly the company’s entire gadget lineup.) Apple has said the increases were necessary because the products had become more complex and expensive to make.Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, defended the iPhone’s rising prices in an interview with “Good Morning America” in September. He said the iPhone was an all-in-one gadget replacing cameras and music players, among other gizmos. “We found that people want to have the most innovative product available, and with that, it’s not cheap to do that,” he said.That justification did not add up for me. Since the iPhone’s debut in 2007, it had been a multifunctional device that continually incorporated cutting-edge features without significant price increases. The same went for Apple’s watches, computers and tablets: They became more advanced over the years without big price jumps — until now.And there is a question of whether Apple has pushed prices up too high. On Tuesday, the company — while dealing with reports about an embarrassing privacy glitch that let iPhone users eavesdrop on one another’s microphones — reported disappointing financial results. In a letter warning investors before the quarterly earnings report, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales may have slowed because of factors including higher prices.For a reality check on Apple’s pricing, I spoke to financial experts and pricing strategists. I learned that there is credence to Apple’s arguments: Its products do cost more to produce than in years past. But that didn’t stop me from consulting with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products and tracks deals, for advice on how we could shave the costs of our next Apple upgrades.Here’s what I found.How and why Apple raised pricesLast year, Apple’s prices shot up by 7 percent to 60 percent, depending on the product. Perhaps the most notable increase was for the new Mac Mini, which costs about $800, up from $500. (The last Mac Mini debuted in 2014.) Some Apple prices stayed firm or declined. Notably, the newer entry-level iPad is selling for about $330, down from $500 in years past.But in general, prices jumped. That was surprising given that product costs typically fall as technologies mature and parts become widely available, which was what happened with televisions.The more I examined the pricing, though, the more evidence there was that the latest Apple products are more expensive to make. Apple also appears to be under pressure to introduce more complex innovations to compete in the brutal technology market.Take a look at the company’s gross profit margin, or the money it makes from products after the cost to make and sell them is factored in. If Apple’s gross margins are lower today even though prices are higher, that indicates the products cost more to make. And that is indeed the case. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who has studied Apple for years, estimated that the company’s gross margins for the iPhone were below 40 percent, down from more than 50 percent several years ago. Mr. Sacconaghi said the shrinking margins demonstrated how tough it had become to compete in the technology market. Apple has had to add features like stronger metals, sophisticated cameras, high-resolution displays, advanced chips and faster wireless connectivity while trimming back on some profit given that rival products from the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo have become very capable. If Apple had wanted to keep profit margins consistent with past years, he said, it would have had to raise prices even higher and risk losing sales.“You have to put in more to stay competitive, or you’re going to lose share,” he said.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said Apple was still in a unique position to introduce broad price increases. Other companies, such as grocery brands, lack the clout to do so because their competitors might undercut them and lure away customers.“They’re in the very enviable position that they can, by and large, take major action across the board without, so far, seeing a major erosion of loyalty as a result,” Mr. Wiesel said.An Apple spokeswoman referred to Mr. Cook’s comments on Tuesday’s earnings call. In response to a question about whether Apple had raised prices too high, Mr. Cook said the prices were not that much more. He noted that the iPhone XS was the same price as last year's iPhone X, and that the XR was priced only slightly higher than the iPhone 8.How to save on Apple gearDiscounts for new Apple products are rare. But here are several methods to lower the cost of your next purchase.Trade in your old deviceOne simple way to get some cash toward your next purchase is to take your old devices to a trade-in program at a retailer or a wireless store. Apple runs Apple GiveBack, which gives you Apple Store credit in exchange for an old phone, tablet, computer or smart watch. Gazelle, an online reseller, will let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs in exchange for cash or Amazon store credit. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless offer trade-in programs. And Best Buy stores also provide store credit for many used devices. Buy last year’s modelThe best part about the release of a new Apple product is that last year’s model can be had for cheaper. Apple now sells the iPhone 8, still a very good phone, for about $600, down from its original $700 price. Wait for salesOlder-generation Apple Watches and tablets occasionally go on sale during holiday shopping periods such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Wirecutter said. In November, the Apple Watch Series 3 dropped to $200 on Amazon, down from the original $330.To scout for deals, you can create alerts for price drops using web tools like Camel Camel Camel. Wirecutter also runs a webpage that regularly highlights deals.Apple product discounts tend to be better when you buy through third parties like Best Buy and Amazon. “The best tip is to shop around before going to the Apple Store,” said Alex Roth, a commerce editor for Wirecutter.Buy used or refurbished gadgetsTrusted brands like Apple, Best Buy and Amazon offer programs to buy refurbished or used products. Refurbished products typically were returned by a consumer and then restored to excellent condition, and they often include a fresh battery and warranty. Apple’s online store for refurbished products lists last year’s iPad Pro for about $550, down from about $650.Buying used Apple gadgets can often yield more savings, but you will have to be judicious about whom you buy from. Your best bet is to buy from a friend, a relative or a reseller that is a trusted brand. I have had consistently good experiences buying used products from Amazon’s Warehouse program, for example.Skip the upgrade altogetherOf course, you can save $750 on the next $750 iPhone by not buying it at all. The most thrifty thing you can do is to maintain your device and skip upgrading. Plenty of Apple customers have caught on to this approach. The company acknowledged in its recent note to investors that many iPhone customers took advantage of its battery replacement program, which may have contributed to slower sales of replacements.There’s a hidden benefit to giving your devices some tender loving care.“Take good care of the one you have so that when the time comes for an upgrade, you can trade that one in and you’ll get something for it,” Mr. Roth said."
5c2e756f3a125f5075c02baf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/apple-revenue-china-innovation.html,"If anything, MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It’s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed — the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue of Ember magazine and, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. “Let’s be buds” urges a sign on one table.It certainly looks like it’s going great at this chain of weed dispensaries. But — like a lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in California — MedMen is struggling. The latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed a net loss of $66 million on revenues of $21.5 million. It had lost $79 million the previous quarter.Not enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMen’s problems, but the disconnect between the company’s promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week: Apple’s announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Apple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes. It is, to use an old California trope, going to be a real bummer for Silicon Valley.Now stick with me here, because what’s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?Apple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook. He, of course, was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs, who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in 1997. Since then, it has been all uphill, to the point this summer when Apple reached a $1 trillion valuation — the first publicly traded American company to reach that high — with a price of $207.39 a share.ImageAn Apple Store in Grand Central Terminal in New York.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesToday it’s trading at $142.64, and analysts are predicting it will settle around $135. Yipes. Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China, where Apple products are popular, and the Trump administration’s trade war. But as Ina Fried of Axios noted: “The problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple. But Apple’s iPhone problems extend far beyond China, too.”Indeed. The last big innovation explosion — the proliferation of the smartphone — is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a “Cambrian explosion,” a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify. Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.Apple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.That business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don’t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it’s apparent that it’s now winding down.This is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward. The last cool set of companies — Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and, yes, Tinder — were created many years ago, and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising.Well, rental scooters. O.K., they’re cool, but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now. How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.Where is that next spark that will light us all up?Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

5c50807f3a125f5075c06e89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/disable-facetime-bug.html,"A major bug in Apple’s FaceTime app surfaced on Monday that allows anyone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer to eavesdrop on other users without their knowledge. Apple said Monday evening that it was aware of the glitch, was working on a fix and would release it in a software update later this week.In the meantime, Apple has turned off Group FaceTime, the feature that allowed for surreptitious listening, which should temporarily resolve the issue. But for those who want an extra layer of security, follow these steps to turn off FaceTime on your devices.Step 1: Check if you’re susceptibleBefore you do anything, you need to make sure your Apple device was affected by the glitch. It exists on iOS devices with the most recent software updates, starting with iOS 12.1, which was released in October. That release introduced the Group FaceTime feature.To check your iOS version, open the “Settings” app, scroll down and select “General,” and then click on “About.” In the following list, you’ll see a line titled “Version” followed by the operating system on your device. It may say 12.1.3, the latest iOS update.VideoThe glitch appears on iPhones running iOS 12.1 or newer. Here’s how to check your iOS version.CreditCreditOdd Andersen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIf your iOS is 12.1 or newer, such as 12.1.3, your device could be at risk. If it is 12.0 or older, you’re in the clear.On Macs, the Group FaceTime feature was introduced in October, starting with MacOS 10.14.1. Check your MacOS version by selecting the Apple icon in the top left of your screen and clicking on “About This Mac.” The latest version is MacOS 10.14.3.ImageApple disabled Group FaceTime, the feature that caused the glitch, while it works on a permanent fix.Step 2: Turn off FaceTimeOn an iOS device, open “Settings” again. Scroll down a bit until you see “FaceTime” and select it. This part is simple: Tap the green button on the top row, which will toggle FaceTime off. The button should turn gray and everything that had been below, such as your app settings, should disappear.Apple says there’s no need to delete the app on your home screen after following this step, but nothing’s stopping you.VideoDisabling the FaceTime app on an iPhone takes only a few steps.CreditCreditJohn G Mabanglo/EPA, via ShutterstockJust note that if you disable FaceTime, your phone will not receive any kind of FaceTime call, including video, audio or group chat. Regular phone calls won’t be affected.To turn off FaceTime on Macs, open the app, which may be in your dock or in your Applications folder, select “FaceTime” at the top left of the app, and then select “Preferences.” Click on “Sign Out.”Step 3: Wait for bug fixApple said that a software update scheduled for release later this week should resolve the Group FaceTime bug. When it is announced, make sure to update your devices by going to “Settings,” then “General” and selecting “Software Update.” On the Mac, download the update by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left of your screen, selecting “System Preferences” and clicking on “Software Update.”After that, re-enable the FaceTime app by following Step 2. On iOS devices, toggle the FaceTime button in “Settings” until it turns green again. It may take a bit of time for your old settings and account information to reappear. On a Mac, open the app again and sign back in under “Preferences.”And if you deleted the app on your iPhone or iPad, you can re-download it through the App Store."
5c51e5a23a125f5075c07250,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/personaltech/skype-voice-recorders-foias.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, discussed the tech she’s using.What are the most important tools that you, as a magazine writer who does investigative reporting, rely on? Honestly, the vital tool in my work is people’s willingness to trust me with their stories and to patiently explain to me what I don’t understand. That’s what I need to do my job. Everything is a means to that end. Talking to people face to face is still the best, and when I can’t meet someone in person, Skype is my substitute. When I Skype from my laptop, it looks like I’m calling from my cellphone number. I use a software addition called Call Recorder to tape calls (after asking people’s permission). It pops up when the call begins, which makes me remember to hit the button, and then it saves the calls in Ecamm Movie Tools. From there, it’s easy to export the files and play them.When I say easy, I mean it, because when a tech tool isn’t easy to use to the point of being self-explanatory, I can’t get myself to use it. I don’t say that with pride. It’s a handicap to be bad at solving tech-related problems. But when I can’t figure something out quickly, I don’t think, “Hmm, this is an interesting puzzle — how can I solve it?” I just get frustrated and mad. Another tool I rely on is my Zoom H1n digital voice recorder. It’s light and hand-held, and it doesn’t obviously look like a tape recorder. It even comes in a little case that looks as if it could be for eyeglasses. The sound quality is good, especially for its size.ImageMs. Bazelon, who lives in New Haven, keeping in touch with Mr. Plotz from the Yale recording studio she uses for Political Gabfest.CreditSangsuk Sylvia Kang for The New York TimesI do think the design could be updated: For example, you need an old USB cable to export files onto your laptop, and then I have trouble remembering how to find them.One more tool: Freedom of Information Act requests. The state and federal laws that allow citizens to request information from the government are a great friend. (There’s a caveat: Some agencies take a long time to respond, so if you’re on a tight deadline, you may be stonewalled.) I’ve done investigative projects based on a relatively small number of documents, but if I ever have to sift through a huge data dump, looking for patterns and smoking guns, I’ll use a software program called Everlaw. It lets you browse quickly without worrying about what format a document is in. (For example, you can switch back and forth between text messages and a PowerPoint.) I like the options it offers for organizing material. Full disclosure: My nephew Zach Sabin is a software engineer who helped develop this product.You are also a co-host of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. What does your podcast setup look like? When David Plotz, John Dickerson and I started taping the Gabfest more than a dozen years ago, we worked together in an office in Washington and sat down in a studio there and just talked into microphones. Then I moved to New Haven. For a while, I used a tie-line box, which is a kind of magical connection I won’t try to explain. Later, I switched to an app for my iPhone called Report-IT Enterprise Edition. This one is dummy proof. It has a Report Live feature, which connects you in much the way the tie-line does, or so it seems to me. ImageThe studio became Ms. Bazelon's recording home after a security firewall prevented her from using an iPhone app, Report-IT Enterprise Edition.CreditSangsuk Sylvia Kang for The New York TimesReport-IT also offers Record a Report. For this option, you place a regular telephone call and then tape yourself talking into your iPhone. When the call is done, you upload it and send it off to some server in the sky.I have screwed up Report-IT only once, and that was because I forgot to turn it on. Last year, though, it stopped working because of a security firewall in Slate’s Washington office. So I started taping at the Yale Broadcast Studio, where the engineers are super nice and competent and all I have to do is stay on mic.As a pretty active Twitter user, you get a fair amount of feedback from readers, good and bad. What’s your advice for dealing with the hate? My advice is to be thick skinned about hate but open to thoughtful criticism. Of course, I don’t always take my own advice. Last summer, I wrote an essay for The Times Magazine about the term “white people,” which launched a thousand neo-Nazi trolls in my Twitter timeline. Actually, I have no way of knowing if there were a thousand trolls or five trolls and 995 bots, but lots and lots of accounts were tweeting anti-Semitic garbage at me. Other Jewish journalists have experienced this to a greater degree than I did, and journalists of color regularly have it much worse, as do women who write about misogyny. I didn’t enjoy my turn at being trolled, but I feel defiantly attached to my essay.ImageAn active Twitter user, Ms. Bazelon said, ""My advice is to be thick skinned about hate but open to thoughtful criticism.""CreditSangsuk Sylvia Kang for The New York TimesThe danger of hateful feedback (in addition to the possibility of actual danger) is that to repel it, you risk numbing yourself to constructive criticism. I try to deal with this by giving myself a little time, after I publish a story, before I look at emails from readers or comments online. With distance, I can process criticism and funnel it into making my work better. I have a book coming out in April, and I am really going to have to remember this when it comes out.Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family using a lot?Pity my children. Five years ago, when they were in elementary school and middle school, I published a book about bullying in which my basic advice to parents about technology was to delay access to it. Especially smartphones. My sons got flip phones in seventh grade and iPhones in ninth grade (the older one) and eighth grade (the younger one). They would tell you that they missed out on certain social interactions, especially group texting, because their parents were dogmatic. (Also, in my own case, hypocritical — I have trouble unplugging.) I will say, though, that I still think setting limits is crucial. I like the mantra “People sleep upstairs. Phones sleep downstairs.”These days, my family bonds more over my tech ineptitude than any tech product. (It would be better if the gender dynamics in this story were reversed, but so it goes.) In particular, I’m mocked for not being able to turn on the television. There are four remote controls, with cryptic prompts for activating four different boxes. I can’t keep it all straight. I get to pick the shows sometimes, though."

Think about the digital junk we hoard, like the tens of thousands of photos bloating our smartphones or the backlog of files cluttering our computer drives, such as old work presentations, expense receipts and screenshots we have not opened in years.In addition to the digital mess, tech hardware adds to the pile of junk that sparks no joy in our lives. Everyone has a drawer full of ancient cellphones, tangled-up wires and earphones that are never touched. And the things we do use every day, like charging cables strewn around the house, are an eyesore.Why are people so terrible about tech hoarding? Cary Fortin, a professional organizer for the company New Minimalism, summed it up: “We don’t really think about the cost of holding on to things, but we think about the cost of needing it one day and not having it.”Don’t fret, dear reader. As a technology critic who tests dozens of gadgets a year, I’m in a unique position of having to wrestle with extraordinary amounts of tech products and accessories every day. (Last year, I brought nine new smartphones, two tablets, four smart speakers and 14 power accessories into my home.) So here’s a guide to tidying up your technology physically and digitally, including tips from professional organizers.How to declutter your power cablesThe No. 1 culprit of tech clutter in every household, professional organizers say, is the power cable. Part of the problem is that we typically need different wires for products like smartphones, battery packs, cameras and laptops. These then accumulates into one tangled mess. Here’s how to solve power cable overpopulation in a few simple steps:Gather them all together and purge the ones you don’t need. This sounds easier said than done, but here’s a good rule of thumb: “If you don’t know what it goes to, get rid of it,” said Marissa Hagmeyer, an organization consultant and co-owner of Neat Method. Among the wires you keep, if there are extras, cap them at two, such as two Micro USB cables, she said. In the process, you may end up discarding a wire that you later need. But don’t beat yourself up. “You can buy a new one if it turns out you needed it,” Ms. Fortin said. That’s better than wasting space on something you might hypothetically need.The same approach can be applied to other tech gadgets, like the obsolete smartphone that is living in your sock drawer. If you haven’t used it for six months, get rid of it. Unwanted tech accessories and gadgets can be discarded responsibly through donation centers or e-recycling programs like Best Buy’s.Have a designated place for all your tech accessories. Pick somewhere in your home where your various wires will live, like a closet, cabinet or drawer. From there, categorize the wires and give them compartments. I separate my different types of wires — earbuds, phone chargers, miscellaneous USB cables and computer chargers — into Ziploc bags and label them with a label maker. All the bags live in a drawer in my TV stand.There are different approaches to organizing your power cables. Families with children could give each member a compartment. For example, put your son Joe’s iPhone charger, laptop charger and earbuds into one Ziploc bag and label it “Joe’s tech.”This step is a must. “If you don’t have a dedicated place for your items, then you’re wasting your time finding them,” said Keith Bartolomei, a professional organizer for Zen Habitat.Hide wires that live out in the open. Even if you find a place to stash your spare cables, you probably have a few left plugged in all day. To tidy them up, there are methods to hide the wires or, at the very least, keep them off the floor.Mr. Bartolomei recommends using twisty wires and rubber bands to keep wires wrapped around furniture, like desk legs. There are also products for bundling up and concealing wires, like fabric sleeves or boxes that cover your surge protector. My approach to keeping wires off the ground is to run them through magnetic buckles that clip onto a metal side table.How to resist digital hoardingImageMinh Uong/The New York TimesCreditMinh Uong/The New York TimesTidying up your digital media may not feel worthwhile because your files are not visible in the real world. Yet holding on to all the data takes up valuable space on devices while also making important files more difficult to find. The professionals recommended a process of purging and labeling what’s left. Here’s how it would work:Do an annual clearance of the files you no longer need. To streamline this process on a computer, open a folder and sort the files by when they were last opened. From there, you can immediately eliminate the files you have not opened in years.On your smartphone, prune unnecessary apps that are taking up space. On iPhones, Apple offers the tool iPhone Storage, which shows a list of apps that take up the most data and when they were last used; on Android devices, Google offers a similar tool called Files. From here, you can home in on the data hogs and delete the apps you have not touched in months.Manage your enormous photo library. Eradicating photos is the most challenging process, the professional organizers agreed, because the thought of deleting your memories may be painful. But photos are some of the biggest data hogs of all, so some periodic maintenance is crucial.Start by trimming out the easy ones: duplicate photos, blurry shots and old screenshots.Then move on to the harder part: deleting the photos that were decent but not your favorites. Mr. Bartolomei said people could look at each photo and ask themselves a few questions: “Is this something you want to see again? Does it make you happy? Do you want to spend more time with this photo in the future?” If you answer no to any of those questions, the photo can probably go in the trash bin.My approach to managing digital photos is to purge everything without doing any organization at all. I use Google Photos, which automatically backs each shot to the cloud, compiles photos into albums and includes a tool for removing images from the device. (I also back up all my photos to an external drive in case I ever become unhappy with Google Photos.) Then I erase all the photos from my iPhone every six months and pay Google $2 a month to manage thousands of my photos at full resolution. Whatever approach you take, don’t skimp on tidying up your data. Even if it doesn’t use up physical room, it can still cause you harm.“It takes up so much psychic space and brings up the same negative effect: anxiety,” Ms. Fortin said. “Since we all have our phones in our pockets, we’re toting our clutter around with us.”Related coverage Five Resolutions to Simplify Your Tech LifeDec. 28, 2016How to Clean Your Filthy, Disgusting LaptopJune 26, 2018What to Do if You Spill on Your LaptopJune 29, 2018Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone PhotosJune 1, 2016How to Sell or Recycle Old ElectronicsDec. 2, 2015"

5cb0550f49f0eacbf1f8345e,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/12/business/12reuters-japan-display-china.html,"TOKYO — A Chinese-Taiwanese group will take control of Apple Inc supplier Japan Display after pumping in funds as part of a 232 billion yen ($2.1 billion) bailout plan for the troubled display panel maker.The rescue comes after previous, publicly funded bailouts failed to help the company cut its dependence on Apple, whose slowing iPhone sales have badly hit Japan Display.The deal will make the buyers Japan Display's biggest shareholders - with a 49.8 percent stake - replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund and effectively ending the government's efforts to keep the last remaining domestic display maker out of foreign hands.The buyer group, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group, will inject up to 80 billion yen into Japan Display by buying shares and bonds.INCJ will also join the bailout by accepting a debt-to-preferred equity swap totaling 75 billion yen and extending senior loans worth 77 billion yen. After the deal its stake will fall to 12.7 percent from 25.3 percent.The deal could potentially be subject to a U.S. national security review at a time when Washington is stepping up its scrutiny on Chinese investment in the United States.Japan Display has a subsidiary in San Jose, a U.S. business that could give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) jurisdiction over the deal. Displays may not necessarily be critical technologies that are export controlled, but some of Japan Display's technologies such as fingerprint sensors could raise a national security concern, said Nancy Fischer and Matthew Rabinowitz, partner and senior associate, respectively, at U.S.-based law firm Pillsbury.Minoru Kikuoka, Japan Display's finance division head, told reporters at a briefing that the company's legal advisors have said a CFIUS filing would not be necessary. CFIUS, however, retains indefinite jurisdiction to request a filing and review the transaction, even after it closes.NEW BEGINNINGSThe bailout comes as sales of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Display's new factory that makes liquid crystal display (LCD) panels running at half capacity.Japan Display expects to post its fifth straight year of net losses in the year ending this month, as disappointing sales of Apple's iPhone XR, the only model with an LCD screen, dashed hopes for a turnaround.The Apple business accounted for more than half of Japan Display's revenue over the last four years.Kikuoka said at the briefing, without naming Apple, that Japan Display still owes its client about 100 billion yen. The U.S. tech giant fronted most of the $1.5 billion construction costs for a new LCD factory three years ago.""We discussed with our client, including that (repayment) issue as well, before we reached the agreement,"" Kikuoka said.Under the latest deal, Japan Display and Harvest Tech, part of the buyout group, are planning to jointly produce OLED panels, used in top-end iPhones, Japan Display said.Reuters reported earlier this month that Japan Display will begin supplying OLED screens for the Apple Watch later this year. Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp in a deal brokered by the government.It went public in March 2014 and was worth more than 400 billion yen then. It is now worth 67 billion yen. (Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Chris Gallagher; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Kirsten Donovan)"

5c53f0a93a125f5075c077c0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/apple-china-iphone-jobs.html,"HUOJIANCUN, China — The line to quit stretched the length of a football field.More than a hundred Chinese workers who once assembled and tested Apple iPhones queued up on a recent morning outside Gate 7 of the vast Changshuo electronics factory to collect their severance and go on their way. They had once hoped that their assembly line jobs would give them big enough paychecks to propel them into a better life. That was before consumers in China turned up their noses at Apple’s new iPhone XR and its nearly $1,000 price. Work slowed. Overtime evaporated. And now workers are giving up.“Usually we had 80 to 90 extra hours” per month, said Zhang Zhi, 25, who had worked two years at the factory but was now standing in the quitting line. Starting in late October, her supervisors started sending her home early and giving her two-day weekends, eating into her overtime. In December, her pay totaled about $370, roughly half what she had made in the busiest months. Ms. Zhang found part-time work elsewhere that pays about $600 a month. Still, she said, “it’s better than staying here.”China’s factories once made products for the rest of the world. These days, increasingly, Chinese factories make products for China as well. Its vast and still-emerging consumer class has opened up a hugely profitable market for global companies like Apple, Nike, General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies in turn use Chinese factories to meet those needs.Today, China’s consumers have grown more reluctant to spend, and many of the workers who depend on them have been hit. Lower demand for consumer goods has led to job losses and shrinking paychecks. That is worsening China’s economic slowdown, which has posed a major challenge for Beijing and could put it at a disadvantage in the trade war with President Trump.China doesn’t disclose reliable employment data, but signs of slowing factory work abound. Car and chemical factories are moving at a slower pace. China’s Lunar New Year holiday begins next week, but some companies were sending home workers as early as December.ImageGuards outside the Changshuo factory, which is owned by Pegatron, a Taiwanese company.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesHuojiancun isn’t the only place where weak iPhone sales are leaving an impact. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, employment at a vast factory that makes iPhones has fallen to about 70,000 from the already low pre-Lunar New Year level of more than 100,000 a year ago, according to China Labor Watch, which tracks working conditions and speaks to workers in China. In a statement, the Zhengzhou factory’s owner, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn, declined to comment directly on the group’s figures but said it was constantly reviewing its operations and planned to add more than 50,000 positions across China in the first three months of the year. An Apple spokeswoman, Wei Gu, pointed to the company’s previous statements and declined to comment further. Huojiancun is a rough industrial community on the edge of glittering Shanghai. Snack shops, calling card stalls and other small businesses catering to factory workers pervade the narrow streets and alleys surrounding the Changshuo plant.Workers there may make the iPhone, but they can’t afford it. Even when their pay was at its peak, those assembly line workers would have needed more than a month’s wages to buy a base-level iPhone XR. Still, jobs there for years were in high demand because they tended to pay more and offer better working conditions than elsewhere. Today, the situation is more complicated. Chinese workers are increasingly difficult to lure because they don’t want to work so many hours on an assembly line. Chinese companies are increasingly exploring automation as labor costs rise. Supervisors kept workers from taking too many breaks and would dock their pay for infractions like littering, said Hou Fu’an, a Changshuo worker who had quit and was heading back home in the interior province of Henan. As workers began to leave over missing hours, he said, many remaining workers started getting overtime again, fattening their paychecks but adding to the workload.“Inside the factory, workers are tightly controlled,” Mr. Hou said. “If one person does not do well, everyone in the group will be yelled at by the group leader. But they did not yell much when there were not many workers left.”The Changshuo plant is owned by Pegatron, a Taiwanese contract assembler. Its shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since the summer as the trade war with the United States mounted and as skepticism grew about the appeal of Apple’s latest iPhone models, which were released in September.ImageChangshuo workers lining up for their severance pay.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesA Pegatron spokeswoman, Ming-Chun Tsai, declined to comment on the Apple business.Every year, before Apple’s usual September launches of its latest iPhones, the Changshuo factory adds temporary workers to accommodate the rush. It offers bonuses that can vary from $400 to $1,300 depending on demand, workers said. Qualified workers must be between 18 and 45 years old, be able to recognize the English alphabet and sport no visible tattoos, they said. Many workers then typically leave before the Lunar New Year holiday, when they generally qualify for their bonus. But workers and local businesses alike said more workers than usual were leaving this year. Huang Qionghuang owns a stall that sells bras that won’t set off metal detectors, an essential undergarment in a factory that scans workers coming and going to make sure they aren’t stealing or smuggling in cameras to take photos of the latest iPhone. In the past, October was her busy season. But sales slumped in recent months, and she dares not buy more bras to stock. The ones that did sell were the cheap ones, costing roughly $2.50.“Last January, I earned more than my rent,” Ms. Huang said. “Now I can’t even make enough to pay the rent,” which she added was about $500 a month. “This is the worst year since I came here three years ago,” she said.Pegatron holds an outsize presence in Huojiancun. Online, it says the plant employs 70,000. Neon signs hanging among the warren of stalls next door call them the “Pegatron night market.” During busy seasons, according to local merchants, the streets and alleys are so crowded it can be difficult to move around.More recently, merchants said, the Pegatron night market has grown quieter. “There are fewer workers in the factory,” said Xu Aihua, who opened a local restaurant with his mother eight years ago. Looking up from the chicken soup he was making, Mr. Xu pointed to the nearly empty street out front. “See? There’s nobody.”That could mean tough times for him and his mother. Their rent costs about $1,500 per month. A year ago, his daily revenue totaled about $150. In recent months, he has earned about half that. ImageWomen buying suitcases in what locals call the ""Pegatron night market."" Local merchants said the market had grown more quiet as workers left.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesAt the line to quit at Gate 7, Wang Xiaofeng stood in the cold waiting for a severance that he hoped would total about $150. A year ago, his work hours were relatively steady. But this December, his overtime dwindled. “I had three or four days without work in a week,” he said. “How much was I going to earn?”Mr. Wang said he had found a new job, one that gave him more hours to pad his paycheck.“I made the right decision,” he said. “I do not regret it.”"
5c2e3fe03a125f5075c02b38,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/business/china-consumer-economy-apple-iphone.html,"HONG KONG — For years, no matter what was happening elsewhere, global companies bet billions upon billions of dollars that China’s consumers would keep spending money.Now, just when the world economy could use their financial firepower, they are holding back, worried about the country’s slowing growth, a trade war with the United States and  rising amounts of personal debt.Zhao Zheng, 26, is among the cost-conscious consumers.On Thursday, Mr. Zhao, a real estate agent, was browsing smartphones made by Xiaomi, a Chinese rival to Apple that prices its handsets at a fraction of what the American tech giant charges for iPhones. He said the success in China of Xiaomi and Miniso, a chain of low-cost variety stores, suggested that Chinese consumers were looking to get more for their money.“The economy,” Mr. Zhao said, “is definitely very bad.”A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.Stock markets stumbled again on Thursday, in part over concerns that American companies and manufacturers are starting to feel the effects from the slowdown in China and the trade war. The S&P 500 sank 2.5 percent, while shares of Apple dropped nearly 10 percent after the company unexpectedly slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhones sales in the country.The rise of the Chinese consumer is not over yet, and Apple’s disappointing numbers stem in part from the company’s own decisions. But the weakness at Apple followed reams of other data — declining car sales, faltering retail sales, a slumping property market, a tougher job market — that signal Chinese consumers may be losing their once unshakable confidence.The sagging confidence could undermine China’s efforts to redirect its economy and spur growth.The Chinese government hopes consumers will become a greater source of economic growth as the country’s longtime reliance on government-sponsored infrastructure projects and old-line industries like steel and cement pays ever-smaller dividends. In recent years, Beijing has rolled out a huge social safety net, tax breaks and other incentives to get people to spend more of their own money on the trappings of middle-class life.ImageA production line at the FAW-Volkswagen Tianjin Plant in Tianjin, China. China’s auto market, the world’s biggest, experienced a sales decline in the first 11 months of last year.CreditChina Stringer Network/ReutersThe spending slowdown in China could be a worrying sign for many of America’s biggest companies, too, at a time when their profits and stock prices are under pressure.Greater China — a region that includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — is Apple’s third-largest market after the United States and Europe, accounting for $52 billion in annual sales in the company’s most recent fiscal year. General Motors, through local joint ventures, sells more cars in China than it does in the United States. Eight percent of Procter & Gamble’s total sales in 2017 came from Greater China.Other companies are also feeling the pinch. China’s auto market, the biggest in the world, saw sales fall during the first 11 months of last year. Sales of all smartphones fell by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2018.Chinese consumers continued to spend relatively briskly during other recent slowdowns, and they could still help get the country’s economy back on track. But they have reasons to be reticent now.By many measures, the country’s growth has slowed because of government efforts to wean the economy off a heavy reliance on borrowing as well as other policies that have shaken the confidence of the country’s entrepreneurs.“China is at a turning point in its economy,” said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. “They’ve basically been on a debt-fueled binge for a decade.” He added, “It’s difficult to turn the ship from industry to consumer at a time of rough waters.”For many people, circumstances have changed.China has too many apartments that home buyers do not want, depressing a property market that is the largest source of wealth for Chinese households. The stock market lost around a quarter of its value in 2018.ImageA housing complex in Jurong, China. The country now has too many apartments that home buyers do not want.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesAnd although they  have a long way to go to catch up to Americans, Chinese households are laboring under growing amounts of debt. Unorthodox Chinese lenders like the online shadow-banking networks known as peer-to-peer lenders are stumbling, giving consumers fewer places to borrow more.Declining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States also appear to be hurting the job market.China does not disclose reliable unemployment data. But a recent survey by Mr. Collier of job postings, recruitment ads, numbers of applicants on recruitment websites and interviews with corporate managers suggested labor demand had weakened significantly. Hiring demand in import and export industries has been hit especially hard, falling 53 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, the survey found.Against that backdrop, it is not surprising that many consumers are looking for ways to spend less.Wang Xiaochuan, who made about $145,000 a year as a pharmaceutical sales representative in Yantai in 2015, now makes less than a third of that thanks to a tightening of regulations on the drug industry. He has cut back his spending, buying Clarks shoes instead of the more expensive Ecco brand, or Coach goods rather than Louis Vuitton.“I’m hearing a lot more bad news about the economy than good news now,” he said.In a country with an aspirational culture that for decades has encouraged people to get rich, Apple has long held a special place. Having a new iPhone meant its owner had made it. Seven years ago, the release of a new iPhone set off scuffles in front of an Apple store in Beijing.But price increases have put the iPhone beyond the reach of more and more Chinese buyers. An iPhone XR starts at 6,499 yuan, or about $950, just over two and a half months’ worth of disposable income for the average Chinese person.Rumors once circulated about young people selling kidneys to buy an iPhone. Now, the online joke goes, it would cost two kidneys.ImageGarment workers at a factory in Guangzhou, China. Declining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States appear to be hurting the country’s job market.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesOn the last day of 2018, William Tan, a 30-year-old university teacher in the southern city of Nanning, replaced his iPhone 7 with a phone made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Although the Huawei phone cost more than $700, about a month’s salary for him, it was still more than $200 cheaper than the base iPhone XR. He had used an iPhone 5, 6 and 7. But when his iPhone 7 broke down, he found he could no longer afford the latest iPhone.The Huawei phone, he said, works fairly smoothly and takes better photos than the iPhone.“I won’t choose Apple again at this price range,” he said.Chinese consumers are by no means done with certain discretionary purchases. Spending on movie tickets and services remains strong, economists said.But the consumer slowdown could worsen if Beijing does not address its economic problems.“The question is whether China can stabilize economic growth when it is facing economic headwinds,” said Wei Li, senior China economist at Standard Chartered.“If the labor market does worsen in 2019 or if financial conditions don’t improve, if the stock market remains low, all this could weigh on consumer confidence,” Mr. Li said.Given the uncertainty, many Chinese spenders will most likely continue to scrimp.Wu Yan, a tech company worker who was looking at Xiaomi phones on Thursday afternoon, said he had also tried Apple and Huawei phones and had decided they were not much different from one another. What matters, he said, was the apps, and they work the same from phone to phone.But Mr. Wu, 40, also said many middle-class Chinese people like him had reached a stage where their work was stable, their income was secure and they no longer needed to show off their spending power. His computer at home? It’s four or five years old now, but it still works fine.“Now we spend just to fulfill our needs,” he said."
5caeec4749f0eacbf1f829aa,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/11/business/11reuters-apple-energy.html,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Thursday it has nearly doubled the number of suppliers using only clean energy for production work, including two that assemble and make the processor chips for the iPhone.Apple last year said it meets all of its needs with renewable energy such as solar farms that power data centers. But a large part of its carbon footprint comes from its supply chain, and since 2015 Apple has worked directly with those companies to use clean energy for Apple production.Forty-four companies are now in the program, Apple said on Thursday, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose Foxconn unit makes iPhones, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which supplies the A-series chips that power all of Apple's mobile devices. Apple had previously disclosed 23 suppliers in the program. The company defines clean energy as coming from wind, solar or bio-gas fuel cells, as well as what it calls ""low-impact"" hydroelectric projects like a site in Oregon that captures energy from water in irrigation canals to power one of its data centers. Apple did not specify where the new suppliers in the program would get the clean energy. It encourages suppliers to build their own renewable energy projects, such as when iPad assembler Compal last year built rooftop solar installations on its factories in China. When those options are not available, Apple says it aims to have suppliers sign power-purchase agreements with new renewable energy projects and using purchases of renewable energy credits only when there are no other options.In an interview, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said the company is also on track to pass its goal of adding 4 gigawatts of renewable energy to the grids of its supply chain by 2020 and has a ""sight line"" to ""well over"" 5 gigawatts.Jackson declined to say whether Apple would drop suppliers such as Foxconn and TSMC - whose capabilities few others in the global electronics supply chain can match - if they fail to meet their commitments to the program.""It took a while for them to come on board, and so we believe that now that they have, they're fully committed to doing it,"" Jackson said. ""And obviously if they fall down on the job, we'll be right there on their chase. I can't tell you what will happen, but I hope it never does.""

5cb21d4449f0eacbf1f83c88,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/technology/apple-qualcomm-chips-smartphones.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Nasty legal battles are nothing new in the tech industry. But Apple’s conflict with the wireless chip maker Qualcomm, headed for a crucial court showdown this coming week, has a special intensity.The two companies, once partners of a sort, now disagree about nearly everything — including which one deserves the most credit for shaping the evolution of smartphones.Their formidable legal teams are at war on three continents, in a struggle that could affect the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits and, perhaps, even how much consumers pay for their phones.Now, the action moves to a federal courtroom in San Diego, where jury selection is set to begin on Monday for a trial on an Apple lawsuit and Qualcomm’s counterclaims. The chief executives of both companies are likely to take the stand.The stakes are reflected in the eye-popping damage claims. Four Asia-based contract manufacturers that assemble iPhones and iPads, whose suits have been merged with Apple’s, argue that they collectively overpaid Qualcomm roughly $9 billion in royalties over the years — a figure that could be tripled under antitrust laws to $27 billion.Apple says Qualcomm should also repay $3.1 billion associated with patents whose rights Apple says are exhausted. It has already won a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm should pay nearly $1 billion in withheld rebates.Qualcomm, in return, estimates that Apple’s partners — Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics — owe more than $7.5 billion in unpaid royalties. And it contends that Apple, which reimburses the manufacturers’ royalty payments, should be liable for a doubled penalty that would take the total to $15 billion or more.Qualcomm’s business practices have also attracted harsh scrutiny from regulators in multiple countries, including China and South Korea. A high-profile Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit is awaiting a judge’s verdict after a trial in San Jose, Calif.The world-spanning legal struggle between Apple and Qualcomm touches on two crucial issues for the tech industry: What is the proper balance between patent rights and competition? And what is the proper role of the government in regulating tech giants?“It’s a great deal more than just a legal case,” said Michael Wolf, who has tracked the issues for his management consulting firm Activate.The fight is an existential one for Qualcomm, at least as it has operated for most of its nearly 34 years in business. The company, based in San Diego, pioneered a type of cellular communications in the 1990s that later became a mainstay of mobile devices. That innovation allowed Qualcomm to charge patent royalties on nearly every smartphone sold, which generates the bulk of its profits.Qualcomm has historically charged about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a mobile phone. Because of Qualcomm’s various patents, companies building phones that would connect to cellular networks must pay that fee for every phone — even if the phone does not actually use Qualcomm chips.Phone makers have little leverage to negotiate for lower rates, the F.T.C. argued in its suit, which was filed in January 2017, that leans partly on Apple’s contentions.Because Qualcomm holds monopoly positions in two varieties of wireless chips, the F.T.C. argued, handset makers feared that Qualcomm could cut off shipments if they balked at paying royalties. Qualcomm insists it never used that tactic. Rival chip makers, denied patent licenses from Qualcomm, have fled the market while suppliers like Intel are struggling, the F.T.C. said.Apple, which sued Qualcomm shortly after the F.T.C.’s action, particularly objects to basing royalties on a phone’s total price. It says that formula means that Qualcomm earns more money as handset makers add innovations like displays, touch sensors and data storage unrelated to wireless technology.Qualcomm insists its business model has benefited consumers by helping to fund new innovations like the latest 5G wireless technology. It has responded with counterclaims that Apple and its manufacturing partners violated licensing contracts. Qualcomm has added a string of other court actions, including patent infringement suits against Apple in the United States, China and Germany.Qualcomm has so far persuaded courts in some countries, including China, to ban sales of some iPhones there, though Apple has dodged shipment disruptions, in part, by tweaking some of its software.The fight has also migrated to Washington. A little over a year ago, Qualcomm was spared a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom after the Trump administration blocked the deal on national security grounds. Qualcomm has raised the possibility that any court-ordered changes to its practices would threaten investments in wireless technologies that are critical to the American military and intelligence gathering. The chip maker also hired the opposition research firm Definers Public Affairs, which has distributed anti-Apple research to reporters.Many Qualcomm customers, partners and rivals are involved in the trial that starts on Monday. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive; Philip Schiller, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing; Qualcomm’s chief executive, Steven Mollenkopf, and its co-founder Irwin Jacobs could all be called to testify.One of the thorniest topics is whether Qualcomm’s royalty rates hurt consumers by raising smartphone prices. The F.T.C. contends they do, though it didn’t quantify the impact. Pricing is also at the heart of a separate private case against Qualcomm brought on behalf of smartphone purchasers, which seeks $5 billion in aggregate damages.ImageTim Cook, in Cupertino, Calif., last month. He is expected to testify in Apple’s lawsuit against the chip maker Qualcomm. The outcome could affect the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits.CreditStephen Lam/ReutersQualcomm insists its royalties have negligible effect in the mobile market, because competition is sharply reducing prices on many phones and new features have simultaneously pushed flagship models above $1,000. It is appealing a judge’s ruling granting class-action status in the consumer case.“It’s much easier to show harm in a shrinking market,” said David Reichenberg, an antitrust attorney at Cozen O’Connor who specializes in tech cases. “It’s not easy here.”The 11-day trial in January in the F.T.C. case featured testimony by several Apple executives and numerous internal emails from the companies.Apple, which shied away from Qualcomm chips for the first iPhones, was facing the prospect in 2006 of paying $12 to $20 in royalties per handset, Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, testified at the trial. It wound up accepting a Qualcomm rebate that reduced the rate to $7.50 per device, as long as Apple agreed not to adopt a rival wireless technology, called WiMax, being promoted by Intel, he said.Apple began using Qualcomm chips for iPhones starting in 2011, after tense negotiations, Mr. Williams said. Apple managed to keep the $7.50 royalty rate as part of deals reached in 2011 and 2013, but the smartphone maker faced big financial penalties if it started using other chip suppliers.“We were staring at an increase of over a billion dollars a year on licensing,” Mr. Williams testified in connection with the 2013 deal. “We had a gun to our head.”Another Apple executive, Tony Blevins, testified that it began searching seriously for alternative suppliers in 2013. But Intel didn’t manage to win a share of Apple chip purchases until 2016.After legal hostilities began with Qualcomm the next year, Apple stopped paying patent royalties and Qualcomm stopped supplying chips for Apple’s newest iPhones — forcing Apple to ask Intel for a surprise increase in production, Mr. Williams said.Qualcomm has insisted that its royalty rates, rebates and exclusivity provisions are standard industry practices and had no effect on restricting competition.Companies like Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and Marvell have stopped selling wireless modem chips. But Qualcomm noted that Intel and MediaTek are major suppliers to phone makers, while Samsung and Huawei provide chips for their own phones.“The F.T.C. failed to show harm to competition,” Robert Van Nest, Qualcomm’s lead trial attorney, said in closing arguments at the trial. “The evidence is simply overwhelming that Qualcomm earned its position and success through superior innovation and better products.”"
5ca2e0f749f0eacbf1f7ffdd,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/02/business/02reuters-china-retail-vat.html,"BEIJING — Apple and luxury labels such as Gucci have lowered their prices in China after a cut in its value-added tax (VAT) rate came into effect from April 1.Beijing said last month that it would cut taxes and fees for all companies by nearly 2 trillion yuan in 2019, with the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors set to benefit as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy.Price tags for products listed on Apple's China website were lowered on Monday, including a discount of up to 500 yuan ($74.44) for some of its latest iPhone models. Apple declined to comment on its prices.But French luxury goods group Kering said on Tuesday that its Italian Gucci brand had cut prices by 3 percent, while a spokeswoman for LVMH's Louis Vuitton confirmed its China business had adjusted prices on Friday.Louis Vuitton was ""fully supportive of the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to narrow the price gap between China and overseas,"" she said.Birkin-bag maker Hermes also said it had passed on the VAT cuts to customers in China, with price drops of 3 percent from the beginning of April. Luxury brands have in recent years gradually narrowed the price gap between Europe and China - where their wares could often be 50 percent more expensive - including following a cut in import taxes brought in by the Chinese government last year. The latest price moves follow carmakers BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz which both said last month that prices for several car models would drop following the Chinese tax changes.Several Chinese electronics retailers lowered prices for iPhones in January, discounting latest models by up to $118, after weaker-than-expected sales at end-2018. The world's second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid lower domestic demand and a trade war with the United States.High-end fashion and handbag brands are increasingly looking to woo Chinese clients on their home turf, even though most of the spending by these consumers still takes place in the shopping capitals like Paris, Milan or Hong Kong. ""Long term, luxury consumption will happen incrementally at home,"" analysts at HSBC said in a note on Tuesday. ""A few years ago, 75 percent of Chinese luxury sales happened outside of China. We see that moving to 50-50 either this year or next."" (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Additional reporting by Sarah White in Paris, Editing by Himani Sarkar and Muralikumar Anantharaman)"
5c76e57c49f0eacbf105a7e2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/personaltech/samsung-galaxy-s10-review.html,"After I set up Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 Plus phone last week, I showed it to my partner and said with atypical enthusiasm, “Check it out — this phone has the fingerprint sensor built directly into the screen.”I pressed my thumb down on the screen, where the fingerprint sensor was embedded. “No match,” a message on the phone read. I pressed down again and got the same message. After five failed attempts, it asked for a passcode.“Great demo,” my partner said as she turned back to browsing Instagram on her phone.A few days later, Samsung issued a software update that it described as a security patch for biometrics. After I installed it and re-enrolled my fingerprints, the Galaxy’s reader showed a marked improvement. The phone registered my print to unlock the phone the majority of the time, though there were still occasional failures.My bumpy experience with the print sensor firmed up one conclusion: Face recognition is a more convenient method for unlocking phones, and Samsung is behind Apple in this area. That is unfortunate in an era of skyrocketing phone prices: If you’re shelling out this much cash for a phone, you expect to get the best of the best, not a compromise. The Galaxy S10 Plus is no modest gadget, with a starting price of $1,000. And Samsung is preparing to push prices up even higher with the Galaxy Fold, a highly anticipated $1,980 tablet that physically folds into a pocketable cellphone, which will become available in late April. Apple phased out fingerprint sensors in its newest iPhones after fully embracing its face-scanning technology, which works by spraying your face with infrared dots to create a 3-D image. That image is then used to check whether you are the smartphone’s owner before unlocking the device. Face recognition has proved to be more difficult for thieves to manipulate; it also logs you into your phone more consistently than a fingerprint sensor. Samsung’s phones also have face scanners, but they use a less secure method for authenticating you. More on this later.ImageThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditSamsungDespite the hiccups, I enjoyed using Samsung’s Galaxy S10 Plus, its new flagship device, which will become available on March 8. The device was an upgrade from Samsung’s Galaxy S9 phones, which were also excellent Android devices. Notable new features include a 6.4-inch high-definition screen, an ultra wide-angle lens for taking broader shots, the ability to use the phone to wirelessly charge another device’s battery and an improved battery that made the phone last all day.After I used the Galaxy S10 Plus for a week, here’s what I found.Impressive wide-angle shotsI began my tests by taking the Galaxy S10 Plus outdoors to try the new  camera. The back of the device has a triple-lens system, meaning it has one more lens than some of last year’s Galaxy phones that had dual-lens cameras. The new camera has a so-called ultra wide-angle lens for taking shots with a wider field of view than traditional phone cameras, which makes it handy for shooting landscapes or large group gatherings. To take an ultra wide-angle shot, you pinch inward to zoom all the way out.ImageA photo taken at Ocean Beach in San Francisco using the new ultra wide-angle lens on Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesThe results were impressive. One shot on a beach was so encompassing that it captured people standing on the sand, the ocean waves and the adjacent parking lot.ImageThe ultra wide-angle lens on Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus is well suited for landscape photography.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesAnother ultrawide shot showed my dogs running alongside a pond and the surrounding trees, blue sky and grass fields. The details of the ripples in the lake and the clouds in the sky looked stunning.Initially, I was skeptical about needing yet another camera lens on a smartphone, but ultrawide photography was delightful. I look forward to this feature coming to other phones this year.An excellent screen and a robust batteryThe new Samsung device’s 6.4-inch screen is on a par with the 6.5-inch screen on Apple’s iPhone XS Max and the 6.3-inch display on Google’s Pixel 3 XL. All produce sharp, rich images with accurate colors and excellent shadow detail. (If you asked me which screen was best, I would call it a draw.)As for the battery, the Galaxy S10 Plus had such long battery life that by bedtime after a busy day, the device still had about 25 percent of juice remaining. Samsung said it expanded the size of the battery while also improving the software to manage energy use.Samsung is so confident in the new Galaxy phone’s battery that it designed the device to wirelessly charge other gadgets, like smart watches and other phones. The feature, Wireless PowerShare, uses induction, which involves tapping an electrical current to generate a magnetic field that powers other devices.To use the power-sharing feature, you hit a button in the phone’s settings and place another device that supports wireless charging onto the back of the Samsung. I stacked my iPhone and the Galaxy S10 Plus back to back, and it took the Samsung about 15 minutes to replenish 5 percent of the iPhone’s battery. That’s a slow charge rate, though Samsung said the feature was primarily intended for charging accessories like wireless earbuds or smart watches.An improved fingerprint sensor, but weaker biometrics than the iPhoneI found that the fingerprint reader on Samsung’s Galaxy S10 Plus was an improvement over past models. But the device’s biometrics over all were still weaker than the features on Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s biggest rival.In previous Samsung phones, the sensor was a physical button on the back of the phone near the camera, which often led people to accidentally bump the camera lenses when attempting to unlock their phones.Now the sensor is on the front and embedded in the screen. Its ultrasonic technology uses sound waves that read the ridges and valleys of a finger. This means you can now unlock the phone while it is flat on a table, and the ultrasonic technology will be able to scan your print through water or grease. In addition, because the captured image is so detailed, the print becomes much more difficult to spoof than with past fingerprint sensors.In my tests, I was able to unlock the phone while my hand was damp.On the downside, Samsung is behind Apple in face recognition. While Apple uses infrared scanning to create a precise 3-D map of a person’s face, Samsung’s face scanner uses the camera to take your photo and then compares it with an image stored on the device. So a thief could fool the system by holding a photo of your face in front of the camera.Because a person’s head shape is unique, the likelihood of bypassing infrared-based facial recognition with an incorrect face is one in a million, according to Qualcomm. In contrast, the false-acceptance rate of older face-scanning techniques like Samsung’s is one in 100, and the false-acceptance rate of fingerprint scanning (including the new ultrasonic technology) is one in 50,000.ImageInside Samsung's phone settings, a disclaimer on the face-scanning feature warns users that the security is weaker than other unlocking methods.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesNonetheless, I tried Samsung’s face recognition feature. When you set it up, Samsung shows a warning that face recognition is less secure because someone who looks like you or uses an image of you could unlock the phone. After taking a photo of my face, the feature was quick to detect my mug and unlock the phone, but it did not instill me with much confidence.I shared my concerns with Samsung. Drew Blackard, a director of product marketing at the company, said that based on customer feedback, the fingerprint sensor was the most popular method for unlocking devices. As a result, the company focused on improving that feature.He added that Samsung was studying face recognition and had made it more difficult to trick the scanner with a photo of a person’s face. “Is it an area that we’re continuing to look at? The answer is: Of course,” Mr. Blackard said. I have to say Samsung’s decision to focus on fingerprint sensing instead of upgrading its face scanner is not particularly satisfying. User feedback isn’t generally an ideal way to design security features. After all, many people also enjoy using the same weak passwords across all their internet accounts.It also bodes ill for other Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Fold, which is among the most anticipated handsets of the year. If tomorrow’s smartphone folds up like a book but lacks some of today’s best security features, it would certainly give me pause.Related Coverage A Review of the Samsung Galaxy S9, in EmojiMarch 8, 2018Samsung’s Galaxy Note9: Too Much Phone for Most of UsAug. 22, 2018The Google Pixel 3 Review: Phone’s Smarts Shine Through Its A.I.-Driven CameraOct. 15, 2018The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Big Screens That Are a Delight to UseSept. 18, 2018The Smartphone’s Future: It’s All About the CameraAug. 30, 2017"

Kelly.CreditAlyssa Schukar for The New York Times[Want to get this by email? Here’s the sign-up.]On any given day, dozens of Times reporters venture into the world, conduct an interview for a story and record it — on their iPhone, a digital voice recorder or an old-fashioned tape recorder.They record it, above all, for fact-checking purposes, to ensure that every word they quote from an interview is accurate.But the fate of those recordings, after a story is published, is usually tragic: They sit unheard, as nameless files, waiting to be deleted with a swipe of the thumb.Then came “The Daily.” From the moment we created the show, we knew these recordings would be a treasure trove. An army of colleagues was already creating hours of memorable and exclusive audio. We just needed them to send it to us.And they did. In April 2017, two months after “The Daily” was launched, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush interviewed a recently inaugurated President Trump in the Oval Office.The “Daily” producers working on the episode — Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills and Lisa Tobin — learned about the meeting only an hour beforehand.We knew Maggie and Glenn would record the interview. That was a given. So we emailed an urgent request: Please make sure the recorders are as close to the president as humanly possible. (We wanted high-quality audio, after all.) They complied, and early that afternoon, a 26-minute audio file arrived in our inbox.The result was a breakthrough episode in which listeners could hear our reporters peppering the president with questions and fact-checking his false claims in real time.That show created a model for us. We would build episodes around an original interview, conducted by a Times reporter, and combine it with a second interview — me interviewing the reporters who had conducted the original interview. An interview about an interview. Kind of meta, right?It solved a number of problems. Original interviews contain many compelling moments you’d want to hear, but require a lot of context to understand. Who better to provide that context than the reporters who did the interview?That’s what you heard when I spoke with John Eligon, a national correspondent based in Kansas City. He interviewed the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, about her closely watched prosecution of the musician R. Kelly, sent the recording to producers Jessica Cheung and Annie Brown, and then sat for an interview about the interview. Listen here.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.Live from the iPhone of Mike SchmidtAhead of Monday’s episode, we asked Mike Schmidt to document his Sunday through iPhone voice memos as he and his colleagues in the Washington bureau — Elisabeth Bumiller, Mark Landler, Nick Fandos and others — awaited the attorney general’s summary of the Mueller report.

CreditDavid Halbfinger/The New York TimesProducer Clare Toeniskoetter on how she gets sound from reporters who are many thousands of miles away:“When we interview foreign correspondents, it’s always a challenge to figure out how to record their end of the conversation. For our episode about Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, I reached out to Jerusalem bureau chief David Halbfinger, who told me he already had his own high-quality microphone (something that producers love to hear), but had no way of holding it steady during our interview. That’s where a music stand and some packing tape came in. Plus, we found out David’s secret talent — he’s a violinist!”On “The Daily” this weekCoordination: not established. Obstruction: more complicated. We talk to Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt about how the attorney general summarized the Mueller report. The special counsel was supposed to decide whether Trump committed a crime, but the attorney general did so instead. “I’m starting to think that the special counsel regulations, the way that this investigation was set up, has failed,” Mike Schmidt told us. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces indictment on charges of bribery and fraud. And yet so many are ready to re-elect him. David Halbfinger explains why.Kim Foxx, the prosecutor who took the unusual step of asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward, says she knows how difficult it can be to speak out about sexual abuse.“Atta was an angel. Honestly, not because he was my husband.

Group texts and Slack messages constantly buzz day in and day out, and occasionally, texts and calls will come in while some of us are sleeping or busy — which leads to more texts, crying foul at those who have the nerve to wake us up.Instead of fighting a losing battle against night texters and bosses who won’t stop messaging you after hours, you can use some of your phone’s built-in settings to silence those notifications, without worrying about missing the really important ones. Here’s how to configure Do Not Disturb mode to let calls through from certain people, at certain times, or only in case of emergency.On the iPhoneImageThe Do Not Disturb settings screen on Apple’s iPhone enables you to set automatic quiet hours and allow calls from specific contacts.CreditWhitson GordoniPhone users have a plethora of options for Do Not Disturb mode, ensuring that only the important stuff gets through. Head to Settings > Do Not Disturb to customize it. In particular, you’ll probably want to adjust the following options:Scheduled: Turn this on, and set it to whenever you go to bed and wake up. Notifications will still appear on the lock screen; they just won’t make noise. If you’d prefer to hide them from the lock screen as well, turn the Bedtime switch on — that way, they’ll only appear when you drag down the Notification Center, rather than tempting you to answer emails at 10 p.m.Allow Calls From: By default, your iPhone will silence all calls when Do Not Disturb is on. With this setting, though, you can allow calls from your Favorite contacts, like your spouse or parents. Also, consider turning on Repeated Calls, too, which will allow calls through if it’s an emergency and the same person calls twice within three minutes. (But watch out for spam callers who try to get around it by calling multiple times in a row.)Those are the crucial ones, though there are a few other handy settings in this menu, like auto-replying to text messages while you’re driving. Feel free to peruse the other settings while you’re here.If you enabled the Allow Calls From setting, you’ll need to add contacts to your Favorites group. Open the iPhone’s Contacts app, tap on the person in question, and scroll down to Add to Favorites. Once you have the right people on your Favorites list and the above settings enabled, they’ll be able to call you even when Do Not Disturb is on.iOS does allow you to allow text messages and iMessages from certain contacts, even though in most cases people will call you if it’s urgent. If you want to enable this feature, head to the contact’s info, press Edit, and under the Text Tone options, choose Emergency Bypass. You can also assign certain vibration patterns to your most important contacts so you don’t even need to look at your phone to know who’s texting. Just tap the Edit button, and under Text Tone, choose Vibration and assign something recognizable. This isn’t specific to Do Not Disturb, but it’s a handy feature that serves a similar purpose: helping you know when certain people are texting so you can judge when something is important and when it can probably wait.On Android PhonesImageThe Do Not Disturb settings in Google’s Android mobile operating system let you customize vibrations for your contacts and allow repeat calls to come through even when your phone is set to silent.CreditWhitson GordonIf your phone runs Google’s Android operating system, the Do Not Disturb settings may be laid out a bit differently depending on which phone you use. But here’s the gist of how they work, which should point you in the right direction.First, open the Settings app and head to Sound > Do Not Disturb. From here, you can customize a few aspects of the feature, including:Sound, vibration, and visuals: You probably want audible notifications turned off when Do Not Disturb is turned on, but you can allow your phone to continue lighting up when notifications come through — though I imagine most people would prefer to have this off.Exceptions: This is the really useful part. Here, you can choose to allow calls or messages (or both) from your “starred” contacts, even when Do Not Disturb is on. This allows you to block most notifications but allow those from your spouse, mother or other important people. You can also allow “repeat callers” so that if someone calls you twice within 15 minutes — as would be common in emergency situations — it bypasses Do Not Disturb. Schedule: Finally, this is where you can schedule Do Not Disturb to automatically turn on and off at specific times, like when you go to bed. You’ll absolutely want to enable this.I highly recommend turning on an exception for repeat calls and starred contacts, letting you block most notifications in Do Not Disturb mode but allowing the ones you know won’t be sent unless they’re urgent or important. If you do that, make sure to star the right contacts in Android’s Contacts app — just tap on a contact to bring up their info, and tap the star in the upper right corner to mark them as important.With these settings in place, you can feel much better about using Do Not Disturb liberally — not just at night, but during meetings, date night and whenever else you don’t want to be bothered.Correction: An earlier version of this article suggested it may not be possible to filter text messages from certain contacts in Do Not Disturb on the iPhone. This version has been updated to note that it is possible, and include instructions on how to do so."
5c99122349f0eacbf105eee8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/technology/apple-news-streaming-service.html,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple unveiled a new video streaming service on Monday with a parade of celebrities rarely seen on a stage outside of Hollywood’s awards season, with heavyweight directors like Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams and stars like Octavia Spencer and Jennifer Aniston.Oprah Winfrey even served as the closer for the nearly two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. “They’re in a billion pockets, y’all,” Ms. Winfrey said of Apple’s global reach. “A billion pockets.”As enthusiastic as the entertainment industry appears to be to work with Apple, it is increasingly clear that Apple needs Hollywood. After years of record profits, the company is slowing down. Phone sales are cooling, and despite the relative popularity of products like the Apple Watch, the next big thing has eluded the Silicon Valley giant.Now, short of another game-changing gadget and facing tough competition from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, Apple is trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years. The company unveiled an expansive strategy to push consumers to do more than just buy its hardware products. It has plans for new monthly subscription services for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card.The new services represent an evolution of Apple’s business. For years, Apple focused mainly on selling devices, counting on consumers to upgrade phones and tablets every few years. Now the company is keying on selling content and services for its roughly 1.4 billion active devices, which include Apple TV boxes, Apple Watches, Mac computers and iPads.The streaming service is called Apple TV Plus. After years of speculation about what an Apple alternative to Netflix might look like, the company offered few details about the new offering — but plenty of razzle dazzle. Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Kumail Nanjiani, Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard — even Big Bird from Sesame Street — also joined Apple executives on the stage.At the heart of Apple TV Plus will be new original programs. It will not carry advertising and will begin this fall in more than 100 countries. It will also include programs from other television networks like HBO, Showtime, Starz and CBS.ImageFrom left, Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston announce Apple’s new streaming services.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesBut some of the biggest questions going into the Apple event were not answered, starting with price. The stars talked about their new programs, but the broad story lines of the shows were already known.Mr. Spielberg was the first Hollywood celebrity to take the stage, and he received the morning’s first standing ovation. “This is my first time at Apple,” he said.Mr. Spielberg was also speaking for many in the entertainment industry who were making their first trip to Apple’s campus 300 miles north from Los Angeles. Since October 2017, Apple has spent well over $1 billion on original programming. Five shows have completed filming, and another half-dozen will be finished in the coming months. Apple has ordered about two dozen series altogether.But Apple is coming late to the game. Netflix has been making original programming for seven years and will spend at least $10 billion on content this year. Amazon and Hulu have also made tremendous inroads with the industry.Apple’s entertainment foray could also lead to a culture clash. Silicon Valley and Hollywood operate in distinctly different ways: Apple prides itself on secrecy, while Hollywood runs on a wealth of information. Perhaps aware of this sensitivity, Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, began describing his company last week as an entertainment company instead of a tech company.Apple’s streaming music service has 56 million subscribers. It offers additional cloud storage for a monthly fee, and it takes a cut of the money spent on apps running on its devices, as well as a sliver of digital payments made by iPhones. Apple generated $10.9 billion from services in the last quarter of 2018, compared to $73.4 billion from hardware sales.The video service is the linchpin of Apple’s broader services push. In addition to customers paying $1,000 every two or three years for a new iPhone, Apple hopes they will also pay $10, $20, $30 or $40 a month a one-stop shop for content for all their devices.“In essence Apple is seeking to become a Netflix of everything in services; music, news and magazines, video and games,” said Paolo Pescatore, a technology, media and telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.ImageRoger Rosner, Apple’s vice president of apps, at Monday’s event.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesApple said its Apple News Plus subscription will include access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker, National Geographic and InStyle. It will also feature newspapers like The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. The subscription will cost $9.99 a month and is available beginning today in the United States and Canada.The subscription service builds on a free news app that the company released in late 2015 and comes installed on the company’s iOS software. Apple said about five billion articles are read monthly on Apple News.The price to be part of Apple’s paid news offering is steep. Apple is taking a 50 percent cut of the subscriptions, with the publications splitting what’s left over based on readership. Apple’s cut for news is larger than the 30 percent it takes for subscriptions bought in the App Store. Publishers expressed concern that Apple would maintain access to important consumer data such as credit cards and email addresses as part of the deal.The Wall Street Journal said its business stories and analysis would remain exclusive to its paying subscribers, but it sees an opportunity to reach a new category of readers for general interest news. The newspaper said it would add to its newsroom to support Apple News Plus. The New York Times and The Washington Post decided to not join the service.For video games, the company said it would start a subscription service called Apple Arcade this fall. It did not offer any pricing details for the service, but the company said this will allow people to try out new games. Apple said it will help foot some of the development costs for game developers.Apple also unveiled a credit card called Apple Card. Working in tandem with Goldman Sachs, the company said the new credit card is meant to work mainly on the iPhone — users can apply for the card on the phone and be instantly approved. It will reap bigger rewards if the consumer uses the card on Apple Pay, the company’s digital payment system.The credit card offers 2 percent cash back for spending on Apple Pay. Apple touted how it simplified credit card rewards with “daily cash” deposited back into the digital wallet on the iPhone shortly after purchasing an item.After its barrage of announcements, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, introduced Ms. Winfrey. Apple signed to a deal with her in June 2018. Ms. Winfrey said she was making two documentaries for Apple’s new video service and bringing her book club to the company and turn it into the “biggest, most vibrant, most stimulating” book club on the planet."
5ca69b4149f0eacbf1f81056,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/04/business/04reuters-samsung-elec-results.html,"SEOUL — Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Friday it was heading for its lowest quarterly profit in more than two years as a glut in memory chips, slowing panel sales and rising competition in smartphones hit margins.The South Korean tech giant said first-quarter operating profit likely slid 60 percent from a year earlier, missing market expectations and putting it on track for its weakest quarterly profit since late 2016.Shares in Samsung rose briefly before paring gains to trade flat following the guidance, as many investors are already looking ahead to an earnings recovery on the back an improvement in chip prices in the second half of the year.Samsung supplies memory chips and screens for its own smartphones and Apple Inc, and server chips for cloud companies such as Amazon. Its semiconductor business is the main profit driver. ""In the second half, memory chip prices will have a soft landing, so falls will slow, and the release of new iPhones later seems like a good sign for Samsung's display and memory chips,"" said Kim Yang-jae, an analyst at KTB Investment and Securities.The world's biggest maker of smartphones and memory chips said in a filing January-March profit was likely 6.2 trillion won ($5.5 billion), missing the 6.8 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.Revenue likely fell 14 percent from a year earlier to 52 trillion won. The firm will disclose detailed earnings in late April.Samsung shares were flat as of 0120 GMT, while the broader market up 0.2 percent.The firm earlier had warned the quarter could be disappointing due to falls in memory prices, and slowing demand for display panels used in Apple's iPhones.Samsung's premium Galaxy smartphones meanwhile are struggling to be profitable due to rising costs of innovation, competition from Chinese rivals and the reluctance of consumers to upgrade, analysts have said.HIT BOTTOMSamsung's share price has leapt more than 25 percent since sinking to a two-year low in early January as some investors bet on a recovery in chip demand.SK Hynix Inc, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung - which dominate the global market for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers, smartphones and servers - recently have issued upbeat assessments of the prospects for a recovery in chip prices.Hopes were buoyed further when data showed the manufacturing sector in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March.Samsung is betting a new line-up of smartphones including a foldable handset and a 5G-enabled model will help boost its market share in China, which crashed with the advent of cheaper Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.But its latest phones are expensive to make, weighing on profitability even as its sells faster than its predecessor, analysts say.""New smartphones coming out in the second half won't necessarily help its smartphone business, but will be a plus for Samsung's chip side as those phones require high density chip adoptions,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at BNK Securities.

5c88253849f0eacbf105cb5c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/smarter-living/wirecutter/how-to-choose-wired-wireless-charging-phone.html,"Wireless charging, once a specialty feature, is now standard on many smartphones. For many years Apple was the most notable holdout, but with its adoption of the Qi charging standard in 2017, the technology is now commonplace. Even though wireless charging is advantageous in many situations, it isn’t necessarily useful all the time. The choice between using a new wired or wireless charger depends on what’s important to you. In the simplest terms, wired charging is about speed, and wireless charging is about convenience.Wireless Charging Is Here. So What Is It Good For?Oct. 3, 2018Wired charging is best when you’re short on timeIf you value getting the most charge to your phone as fast as possible, like those precious few minutes between when you get home from work and when you have to run back out the door, stick with a wired charger. For the fastest speeds, you should upgrade from the free charger that came with your phone. If you’re using a relatively new smartphone — an iPhone 8 or newer, Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and later, or the Google Pixel line — you should use a USB-C PD fast charger paired with a USB-C cable. The rounded USB-C ports are fast replacing the USB-A ports you have likely relied on for years and they can offer a lot more power for faster charging. Exactly how fast will depend on the phone you’re using, but in our testing with the iPhone XR, the battery charged around two and half to three times faster with a USB-C PD charger compared with the one that comes in the box — it took the phone’s battery from empty to more than 50 percent in only half an hour. So to get juice in your phone before you run out the door, wired is the way to go.The other benefit of a wired charger is being able to use your phone for sustained periods while it’s charging. In my living room, I love having a long cable with a wired charger because it allows me to scroll Twitter while I watch TV. As long as you’re close enough to an outlet, a wired charger means you can keep using your phone even at the end of a long day. That’s especially true with long cables; a 10-foot Lightning or Micro-USB cable should let you reach any outlet without having to be right next to the wall.ImageCreditSarah MacReading/WirecutterWhy Everyone Needs a Good 10-Foot Charging CableMay 3, 2018Wireless chargers are simpler to use but slowerQi wireless chargers are slower than wired chargers, full stop. The fastest chargers we’ve measured in our testing recharged a fully drained iPhone XR to only 50 percent battery capacity in an hour, around half as fast as a wired charger. But any wireless charger can still fully charge any phone overnight. That’s why I also use one on my bedside table. If I wake up in the middle of the night and want to check my phone (bad habit, I know), I don’t have to worry about waking up my partner when I’m fumbling to plug my phone back in.Even though wireless chargers are slower, they offer a different kind of convenience: they’re dead simple to use. Just drop your phone onto the charging pad and it’ll start charging. I love having a wireless charger at my desk and in the kitchen, two places where I know I’ll pick up my phone to glance at it a lot. Instead of having to physically unplug the phone every single time, I can just pick it up and put it back when I’m done. As a bonus, stand-style Qi chargers let me see notifications or check recipes at a glance when I don’t have a free hand.Ultimately, if I had to recommend a single charger, I’d still say go with a wired charger. It’s more versatile and almost always smaller, which makes it more convenient if you need to bring it along to work or school or when you’re traveling. But it’s a luxury to have different charging options in different areas of the house. Think about how you use your phone in each spot — use wired where you want to keep your phone in hand or you need a faster charge, and choose wireless where you’ll get more out of the simplicity of dropping it and leaving it. Charging, both wired and wireless, is going to continue to get both faster and less expensive over the next few years, making it even easier to optimize your setup.Sign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday.A version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.The Discount Cable and Charger Brands You Can TrustFeb. 25, 2019"
5c2dd43f3a125f5075c02a4f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/business/world-stock-market.html,"Maybe the markets were not overreacting.With the United States economy posting solid numbers last year, the alarming signals coming out of stock and bond markets seemed out of whack with the real world. President Trump’s bellicose trade actions were a concern, but hiring was strong and corporate earnings were surging.But this week, companies have issued warnings about the health of their businesses that suggest investors were right to be worried about growth. On Wednesday, Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China. On Thursday, Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, while growing, would fall short of the company’s earlier forecast. And the American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released Thursday.In the coming weeks, scores of companies will report their fourth-quarter results. A senior White House economics official acknowledged that there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.“It’s not going to be just Apple,” Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on Thursday. “There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.”He seemed to suggest that was not necessarily bad, because it could help the Trump administration achieve its goal of getting China to make trade concessions to the United States.Those comments did little to assuage the fears of investors. The S&P 500 stock index closed down about 2.5 percent, leaving it more than 16 percent below the high it hit in September. But perhaps the most notable move was in the market for government bonds, where investors park their money in times of stress or when they expect the economy to slow. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 2.56 percent, well below the level it reached in early November, when investors were more optimistic about the economy.“On days like today people say, ‘Crud, I’ve got to buy tons of bonds,’” said Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial. “That’s driven by a large change in sentiment.”Important indicators still show the American economy is growing at a decent clip. A measure of employment in the private sector in December, released Thursday, was higher than expected. And ahead of the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report on Friday, analysts estimated that employers added about 180,000 jobs in December.Despite this, companies and consumers are facing challenges that could make them more cautious about spending money. If they pull back, the economy will suffer. Apple’s warning provides strong evidence that the trade tensions with China are taking a toll. And if more indicators show the American economy stumbling, investors will become more convinced that the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate increases are dampening activity.Corporate profits — and stock prices — are highly sensitive to global economic weakness. Foreign sales accounted for 45 percent of the revenues of companies in the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.There are signs of Mr. Trump’s policies beginning to weigh on domestic demand, too. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in December, the largest one-month drop since the last recession.The manufacturing index fell to what is still considered a healthy level, consistent with other data generally showing that the economy remains in good shape. But the downward trend contributed to a growing sense of unease on Wall Street about how soon the current expansion might end.“When it has seeped into the survey it probably means it’s three to five weeks old,” Mr. Vogel said.Indeed, investors are so convinced trouble is coming that they are betting the Federal Reserve will abandon its plans to raise interest rates in 2019.Fed officials predicted in mid-December that the central bank would raise its benchmark rate twice this year, moving the rate into a “neutral” range that neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity. By the end of trading Thursday, the odds of an interest-rate cut in 2019 had climbed above 50 percent.Robert Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reinforced those expectations, telling Bloomberg Television that the Fed should wait at least a few months before considering any additional increases.“We shouldn’t be taking any further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and I think that could take several months,” he said on Thursday.Mr. Kaplan, however, is not a voting member of the Fed’s policymaking committee this year. The committee comprises the Fed’s board of governors and a rotating selection of five of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks.An indication of the Fed’s views could come Friday morning, when the Fed’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a public appearance with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.“There’s a belief he’s willing to back off, but we haven’t seen that yet,” Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said, referring to Mr. Powell. “If the Fed hikes rates in March, it’ll be a mess.”And on Thursday an ominous event occurred in the government bond market. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill. Yields are generally higher on longer-term debt. An inversion of that pattern signals a loss of confidence in longer-term economic prospects and has often served as an early warning of a recession.Investors and corporate executives have experience with slowdowns in large overseas economies, but they have not had to simultaneously grapple with the effects of a trade war. In explaining Apple’s lowered sales forecast, the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, “The economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.” Apple’s stock plunged nearly 10 percent on Thursday, taking its market value down to around $675 billion, well below the $1.1 trillion it reached as recently as October.Mr. Trump’s tariffs have raised prices on a wide range of Chinese components used by American manufacturers. Roughly half of the companies in the I.S.M. survey said tariffs were weighing on profits, or raising costs.Linton Crystal Technologies, a firm based in Rochester, makes specialized furnaces used to grow silicon tubes, which are cut into wafers for semiconductors and solar panels that are sold to customers all over the world. The work was once performed entirely in the United States. But even though they are still designed, assembled and customized in the United States, the machines’ components now are built in China.Mr. Trump has said the goal of his trade policies was to convince companies like Linton to bring back jobs from China. Mr. Hassett emphasized on Thursday that the Trump administration expected the domestic economy to remain strong, and that companies focused on the United States would benefit.But Todd Barnum, Linton Crystal’s chief operating officer, said the cost of making furnaces entirely in the United States was prohibitive. And as a result of the tariffs, the company is also moving design work to China — a move Mr. Barnum said would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs by reducing the need for prototypes to be shipped to the United States.“Our customers don’t care if it was manufactured in the United States,” Mr. Barnum said. “They care about the highest quality at the lowest dollar.”"
5c92aaea49f0eacbf105e261,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/technology/apple-news-wall-street-journal.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — The Wall Street Journal plans to join a new paid subscription news service run by Apple, according to two people familiar with the plans, as other publishers chafe at the terms that the Silicon Valley company is demanding of its partners.Other major publishers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have opted out of joining the subscription service, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.Apple and The Wall Street Journal plan to announce the deal Monday at a media event at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The event is intended to draw attention to the company’s bet on news and entertainment, including a streaming service that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.The service, described by some as a “Netflix for news,” will offer access to a new paid tier of the Apple News app. Through that tier, readers will be able to consume articles from hundreds of participating magazines and news outlets. The app’s free tier will still let people read a smattering of select articles from a wide variety of publishers.To persuade publishers to join the paid service, Apple executives have said the scale of Apple News, which is installed on every iPhone sold to consumers, could introduce millions of new customers to their content.But the most recent terms that Apple is offering to publishers ask for a cut of roughly half of the subscription revenue involved in the service, the people said. Apple has also asked publishers to give unlimited access to all their content, which has caused concern among potential partners, they said. A subscription is expected to cost $10 a month.The deal’s terms have caused some publishers to recoil, as a 50 percent cut is higher than the 30 percent that Apple usually takes from apps and subscriptions sold through its App Store. Publishers are also concerned that they won’t have access to important data about the consumers — credit cards, email addresses and other subscriber information — as part of the deal.Representatives from Apple, The Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post declined to comment. Some deal terms were previously reported by Recode and The Wall Street Journal.As sales of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone, start to slow, the company is expanding into different software-based businesses, which typically have higher profit margins and do not rely on supply chains and manufacturing.Publishers have also been seeking to expand beyond their core subscriber bases, finding new audiences across nontraditional platforms and striking deals with tech companies. Apple has teamed up with news organizations on its Apple News product for years, offering select content to consumers for free.But publishers have grown wary of some partnerships in recent years, as past relationships with companies like Facebook, Medium and others have soured. In the past, Facebook has inked deals with publishers to fund or support new initiatives, only to quickly change plans and yank support from one year to the next."
5ca5030e49f0eacbf1f80a99,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/opinion/apple-steve-jobs.html,"The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s spendy new campus in Cupertino, Calif., is a majestic temple to pomp. An ethereal glass-and-marble cylinder set high on a serene hill, the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co-founder’s famous “reality-distortion field.” It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr. Jobs, smirking joyfully, would bound up to the stage, teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future.And so it was meant to go once more last week, when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as “a Think Different production.”Some different thinking did seem in order. Since becoming the first trillion-dollar corporation last summer, Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street. The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business, but more than a decade after its debut, pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one, and many customers see little reason to upgrade.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]So now, instead of selling better stuff to more people, Apple’s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people. “Today is going to be a very different kind of event,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, taking the stage.It was not. From start to finish, Apple’s affair was a brushed-aluminum homage to sameness — a parade of services that start-ups and big rivals had done earlier, polished with an Apple-y sheen of design and marketing. Among other offerings, Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card, and it offered vague details about a still-in-development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey (who are not exactly edgy or up-and-coming).None of these efforts look terrible. Some, like the news service, might be handy. Yet they are all so trifling and derivative. As the analyst Ben Thompson noted, Apple’s crush of me-too announcements falls far short of Mr. Jobs’s goal of putting “a ding in the universe.” As I watched Apple’s event, I felt the future shrink a little. In its gilded middle age, Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand, stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing, a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook.In an ordinary time, such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine. But these aren’t ordinary times, and Apple is no ordinary company. Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire, the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine. Under Mr. Cook, Apple has cannily avoided every minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years, winning a windfall from President Trump’s tax cut, avoiding getting burned in his trade war — all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth.We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age: Share Your StoriesFeb. 13, 2019Yet, all around Apple, the digital world is burning up. Indirectly, Apple’s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction, the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy. None of these grand problems is Apple’s fault, but given its centrality to the business, Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them. But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future, Apple is shrinking from it.Consider privacy. Mr. Cook is one of the tech industry’s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information, and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations — which is just about the least Apple could do. But what if it thought a little bigger? For example, it could directly take on Google and Facebook — the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism — by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion, or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone. (Google will pay Apple an estimated $12 billion in 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone.)More than restricting the present, Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future. In particular, I wonder why Apple isn’t working feverishly to create new privacy-minded versions of social-media services the world needs.Take messaging, for starters. There is a strong moral case for Apple to turn iMessage, its encrypted messaging app, into an open standard available to anyone, even Android users, who currently lack many privacy-minded messaging apps that aren’t run by an ad company or aren’t friendly with the Chinese government.There might be a business case, too. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, recently reoriented his company toward messaging. As Will Oremus noted in Slate, the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple. This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one; Apple could swiftly undercut Mr. Zuckerberg’s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non-Apple world.RelatedOpinion | Cal NewportSteve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like ThisJan. 25, 2019Here are some other big ideas: Apple could embark on a long-term project to create a privacy-minded search engine to rival Google’s. It could build an ad-free Instagram (its founders just left Facebook in frustration). It could create a YouTube that isn’t a haven for neo-Nazis. Some (or many) of these may be dumb ideas — ideas that would ruin Apple, or at the very least kneecap its short-run profits. But they are at least big ideas; they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do. Let other companies handle streaming entertainment.

5c93b4cb49f0eacbf105e4bc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/opinion/diabetes-insulin-generics-humalog.html,"This month, Eli Lilly and Company announced with some fanfare that it was manufacturing a generic version of its own best-selling insulin brand, Humalog, which it would sell for half off — $137.35 versus about $275.David Ricks, the chief executive of Lilly, said the company was making this seemingly beneficent gesture because “many patients are struggling to afford their insulin.”But they’re struggling, in large part, because since 2001 Lilly has raised the price of a vial of Humalog to about $275, from $35. Other insulin makers have raised prices similarly. In Germany, the list price of a vial of Humalog is about $55 — or $45 if you buy five at a time — and that includes some taxes and markup fees. Why not just reduce the price in the United States to address said suffering?Instead, Lilly decided to come out with a new offering, a so-called authorized generic. This type of product is made by or under an agreement from the brand manufacturer. The medicines are exactly the same as the brand-name drug — often made in the same factory with the same equipment to the same formula. Only the name and the packaging are different.It is perhaps, a sign of how desperate Americans are for something — anything — to counteract the escalating price of drugs that Lilly’s move was greeted with praise rather than a collective “Huh?”Imagine if Apple sold a $500 iPhone for $250 if it was called, say, a yPhone, and simply lacked the elaborate white box and the little Apple on back. That would be patently absurd. An iPhone in a brown paper bag is still an iPhone. And Humalog with a new name isn’t a generic — except according to the bizarre logic of the pharmaceutical industry. Like so many parts of our health care system, its existence has more to do with convoluted business arrangements than health. Generics, as traditionally understood, are copies of brand name drugs made by competing manufacturers once the original patent protection has expired. To be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they have to have the same active chemical ingredients as the brand drug, and be absorbed equally into the blood, though they could look different and contain different inactive additives.Historically and in practice they tend also to be far cheaper, because the advent of generics often introduces robust competition into the market. That is why brand manufacturers sometimes produce an authorized generic once they lose patent protection. That way, they can compete at the lower price point, while preserving the original for those with extreme label loyalty.More recently, authorized generics like Lilly’s stem largely from a different strategy — based on the perverse ways money flows through our health system and who keeps the cash.Over the last 20 years, drug makers have continuously raised the price of some essential medicines in the United States because, well, they can in a country that doesn’t set drug prices. And they do — until the bad publicity catches up with them.Mylan got hauled before Congress in 2016 for raising the price of an EpiPen. Now it’s insulin’s turn. The other two major brand makers of insulin products — Novo Nordisk and Sanofi — have raised prices in lock step with Lilly. But they are based in Europe, so the Indiana-based Lilly has been the primary focus of angry protests here.Part of insulin’s price rise in the United States is because of the middlemen who buy the drugs on behalf of insurers and hospitals and negotiate discounts off the list price for their clients. So Lilly often doesn’t make the full $275 a vial (though, since rebates are secret, we don’t know how much less).By selling an authorized generic, rather than merely lowering the brand’s price, Lilly is essentially doing an end-run around those middlemen and giving patients who don’t purchase through an insurer another option. It is also making sure that if and when cheaper versions of Humalog emerge, it will have an offering to compete. In fact, a “biosimilar” version of Humalog already exists. It was introduced to the United States last year. And yet it costs around the same price as the brand name drug. Why? It is made by Sanofi, which has no interest in starting a price war to lower costs. Finally, Lilly has generated a few positive headlines. “Eli Lilly Will Sell Half-Price Version of Humalog, Its Best-Selling Insulin,” this paper reported. Mylan effectively calmed its EpiPen PR crisis by introducing a cheaper authorized generic. Now Lilly, following a similar playbook, is hoping for a similar result.Will it work? Politicians and patients will decide.But they might well keep these two thoughts in mind: If the product being sold was electricity or gas for your car, a price rise of more than 600 percent over 15 years would be regarded as price gouging and wouldn’t be tolerated. And in Germany and many other developed countries, there is no need for a $137.35 vial of “authorized generic” for Humalog. At around $50 a vial, Humalog as Humalog costs far less.Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and the author of “An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

And so the day went, the two tech titans going back and forth, until trading ended with Microsoft the leader at a market value of $823 billion.The positions of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker’s stock price late last year. The mantle has changed hands seven times among the three companies. Three of those switches have taken place over the past week as the big tech companies reported quarterly results. And Alphabet (Google’s parent company) has lurked not far behind the whole time.The competition reflects the global economic concerns hanging over the markets as well as the changing technology landscape, and it’s a shift from past years. Apple passed Exxon Mobil to become the most valuable company in the United States almost eight years ago, and after 2012 it held on, largely unchallenged, for six years.The company’s ascension was a precursor to Big Tech’s takeover of the stock market. Investors scooped up shares of the largest tech companies, believing their sales growth was unassailable, and by the second half of 2016, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple were the five most valuable companies in the S&P 500.But investors’ faith in Big Tech began to weaken last year. Apple fell hard as signs of a mature mobile phone market, a softening global economy and a trade war between China and the United States raised doubts about the company’s ability to sell more iPhones.Nearly $450 billion was wiped off its market value — an amount greater than all but six companies in the S&P 500.Shares of the other tech titans fell as well. But Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet have fared far better than Apple and the broader market over the past year, as bets by the first two — and, to a lesser extent, by Alphabet — on cloud computing drove a surge in revenue.Microsoft and Apple, which has recovered some of its losses since it reported earnings last week, are both valued at a little more than $820 billion. Behind them are Amazon, at $815 billion, and Alphabet, at $797 billion.In fifth place is Warren E. Buffett’s investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway. But with a market value of $511 billion, it is far behind."

The company said the request went beyond the investigation's scope and took its grievance to the General Court.While waiting for a judgment, Qualcomm however acceded to the EU demand to avoid a daily 580,000 euro ($655,000) penalty for its delayed response.The Luxembourg-based court on Tuesday dismissed the company's case.""The Court finds that the scope of the investigation as defined in the statement of objections, at the state-of-play meeting of 3 September 2015 and at the hearing on 10 November 2016 has not been extended,"" judges said.They said Qualcomm had failed to show that the requested data went beyond what was necessary for the investigation.Last year, the Commission fined Qualcomm 997 million euros for paying iPhone maker Apple to use only its chips to block rivals including Intel.

That sentiment couldn’t have been stronger this week at CES, the largest consumer electronics convention in the country. The conference, which brought more than 180,000 people to Las Vegas, was a reminder of what the tech industry is best at: being optimistic about itself.ImageCreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesWho cares about the abysmal stock market and growing fears that we are sliding into a recession?

People will be able to speak to Siri on their iPhones to play content they had purchased from iTunes on the Vizio TVs. Samsung, Sony and LG announced similar partnerships with Apple.In the past, AirPlay and iTunes videos were mostly tied to Apple-made hardware like the Apple TV set-top box. Their expansion to third parties underlines Apple’s ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services. That’s especially important now that sales of Apple’s cash cow, the iPhone, are slowing. This month, the company reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years.The move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by Apple to open its technology to other companies, including competitors like Samsung.In a statement provided by Samsung, Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet software and services, said that with the expansion of iTunes and AirPlay, “iPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home.”ImageInteracting with facial-recognition software.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesFront and center at CES was the battle between virtual assistants — namely Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant. Google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with Assistant, including smart watches, speakers and displays. The company said a billion devices now work with its assistant, up from 400 million last year. Google wants to make the Assistant the focal point of a consumer’s life: in the home, in the car and on mobile devices.“When I walk down the aisle at Home Depot, will all the devices I might buy work with the Assistant?” Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant, said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats. “The answer is yes.”Amazon also had a large presence at the show. It filled a large conference room at the Venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with Alexa, including an Audi car, a motorcycle helmet and a stereo system.The battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices. Many of the smart gadgets at CES worked with multiple virtual assistants. Aaron Emigh, chief executive of Brilliant, which makes smart home products that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together, not against one another, because the smart home was already too complex, with products like light switches, thermostats and cameras coming from different brands.“The more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home, the more important that it all works together,” he said.ImageAmazon's Alexa technology made its way into car dashboards.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesCar manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and 5G wireless connections. But consumers won’t be able to buy self-driving vehicles from a dealership anytime soon, in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars. Smarter cars with features like built-in voice assistants to help people use maps, play music or get a sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now, however.If the economy does cool off, sales of cutting-edge gadgets will drop. Fast. But that didn’t faze people here. None of the CES attendees I spoke to expressed concern.Matt Strauss, who oversees Comcast’s Xfinity internet and cable service, was especially bullish about the year ahead. He said just about everything announced at CES required an internet connection, so that’s the last thing that people would cut off. “It’s become like oxygen,” he said."
5c52465d3a125f5075c0736e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/facebook-privacy-apple-tim-cook.html,"It’s nowhere in his job description, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has recently taken a moonlight gig as Facebook’s privacy watchdog.On Wednesday, Mr. Cook and his lieutenants took aim at Facebook for violating Apple’s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users’ online activity. Facebook promoted the app through an Apple program that gives trusted developers the ability to install apps for testing without going through the App Store’s normal approval process. Apple responded by cutting off Facebook’s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, causing chaos among the company’s software engineers.The move is the clearest sign yet that the cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up.Mr. Cook, who has called privacy a “fundamental human right” and taken Facebook and Google to task for the misuse of user data in the past, could effectively become a technology regulator of last resort — using the power of Apple’s iOS operating system as a cudgel to force software companies to respect user privacy and play by the rules, or risk losing access to millions of iPhone users.The latest battle came on Wednesday, after TechCrunch reported on a Facebook program, known as Project Atlas, that paid users $20 in exchange for installing an app for Apple devices called Facebook Research. The program, offered to teenagers as well as adults, gave Facebook the ability to track app use, the websites users visited, the Amazon purchases they made and other intimate data.The problem is that Facebook loaded the app onto users’ devices using a kind of fast-track installation that bypasses Apple’s normal App Store download process. This ability, known as side-loading, is available only to companies that are enrolled in Apple’s enterprise developer program, and that agree to side-load apps only for internal testing, not for public use.Apple was not happy, and cut off Facebook’s enterprise developer access for all of its apps, not just the offending research app.“We designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization,” an Apple spokesman said. “Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.”Facebook, which reported strong earnings on Wednesday despite the missteps, is negotiating with Apple to restore its developer access. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.ImageMr. Cook and his lieutenants took aim at Facebook for violating Apple’s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users’ online activity.CreditJim Young/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images(On Wednesday, TechCrunch reported that Google had a similar research app, called Screenwise Meter. In a statement, Google said it was disabling the app, which it said “should not have operated under Apple’s developer enterprise program.”)There’s no doubt that Apple took a firm stand here. But if Mr. Cook truly wants to protect Apple users from privacy-violating apps, he could remove all of Facebook’s products — including Instagram and WhatsApp — from the App Store until the company can prove, in a real and measurable way, that it cares about its users’ privacy.Shutting off Facebook’s access to Apple devices would be a radical step, tantamount to declaring war on a major competitor. But Apple has banned developers for smaller infractions in the past. And in the absence of government regulation, there may be no other option for bringing the company to heel on privacy.Would temporarily cutting off Facebook’s Apple apps be an effective deterrent? Absolutely. In less than a day, Apple’s move to revoke Facebook’s developer certificate has reportedly become a “critical problem” for the company’s developers. Hundreds of millions of people use Facebook through their iPhones, and without access to Apple’s App Store, Facebook would see an immediate and devastating hit to its bottom line. The ban would quickly become an existential threat, and improving privacy on its apps would become an all-hands-on-deck project for the company’s leadership.Would it be fair? Yes. Facebook’s privacy violations over the years have been appalling, and its executives have blatantly evaded the rules that Google and Apple, the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, have put in place to protect their users from being exploited by data-hungry app developers. In emails released late last year, Facebook executives were shown plotting to snoop on Android users’ call and text logs without triggering a permission pop-up. And Facebook’s Onavo VPN app was pulled from Apple’s App Store last year for excessive data collection.Would cracking down on Facebook backfire on Apple? Possibly. Facebook’s apps are some of the most popular offerings on Apple devices, and without access to their Instagram and Facebook feeds, some iPhone users might get frustrated and switch to Android. But this abandonment would happen slowly, not all at once. (IPhone users could still access Facebook’s products through their mobile web browsers.) And more likely, given how heavily Facebook relies on Apple’s platform, Facebook would almost certainly blink first, and make the necessary changes to get back into Apple’s good graces.Is such a big crackdown necessary? It probably is, if Apple is truly serious about protecting privacy. Time and time again, Facebook has shown that it cannot be trusted to protect users’ privacy unless it is forced to do so. And while regulators have fined Facebook for privacy violations, those punishments rarely amount to anything truly meaningful — at most, the company pays a few million dollars, promises to do better next time, and goes right back to work.Would punishing Facebook be an abuse of Apple’s power? Arguably, yes. It’s problematic that by virtue of their strangleholds on the Apple and Android operating systems, Apple and Google have control over huge swaths of the tech industry. And Apple’s own record on privacy is hardly spotless — just this week, the company was forced to shut down the FaceTime feature because of a bug that let users snoop on one another’s phones.But aggressive behavior among tech companies, for much less noble motives, is business as usual — Facebook, for example, routinely cuts off data access to rival apps like Twitter, Vine, and Prisma. And until government regulators impose rules on the tech giants, the most effective regulation on tech industry excesses may need to happen between companies.It’s bizarre and somewhat troubling that Apple could unilaterally punish a competitor for its privacy sins. (Imagine if McDonald’s could shut down Burger King franchises for health code violations, with little explanation and no recourse for appeal.) But it’s hard to argue with Apple’s decision here. It made rules governing what developers for Apple products were allowed to do, Facebook broke them, and it’s now paying a price.Apple’s defense of user privacy, while certainly self-interested, is a boon to its users and a lever for change within the tech industry. And if Mr. Cook wants to take a strong stand against app developers that routinely violate users’ trust, he could start with the biggest privacy violator of all. Facebook won’t change on its own, but a chastening from Apple might be what the company needs to get its act together."
5c4755c93a125f5075c05b34,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/technology/australia-cellphone-encryption-security.html,"SYDNEY, Australia — A new law in Australia gives law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech-industry giants like Apple to create tools that would circumvent the encryption built into their products.The law, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018, applies only to tech products used or sold in Australia. But its impact could be global: If Apple were to build a so-called back door for iPhones sold in Australia, the authorities in other countries, including the United States, could force the company to use that same tool to assist their investigations.The Australian law went into effect last month. It is one of the most assertive efforts by lawmakers to rein in tech companies, which have argued for decades that unbreakable encryption is an imperative part of protecting the private communications of their customers.In recent years, law enforcement officials have complained that tough encryption has made it impossible for them to gain access to the online discussions of crime suspects, particularly in time-sensitive terror investigations.The tension between tech and law enforcement came to a head about four years ago when Apple resisted a federal request to help investigators gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a man who took part in a shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.Image“We never thought it would pass,” Alan Jones of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney, said of the law, which could have global implications.CreditBrook Mitchell for The New York TimesThe Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually found a way around the iPhone’s security without Apple’s help. But if Apple had already created a workaround — a back door, in industry terms — to sell phones in Australia, the American authorities could have simply ordered Apple to use the tool.“This may be an encryption back door for the U.S.,” said Sharon Bradford Franklin, director of surveillance and cybersecurity policy for the New America think tank’s Open Technology Institute. “A back door to an encryption back door.”The Australian law has limited oversight mechanisms. A notice sent to a company must be “reasonable and proportionate,” and the authorities must have a warrant to gain access to a phone or service. But the agency issuing the notice decides what is reasonable.There is an appeals process if a company is asked to build a new interception capability. A firm can ask an independent assessment panel consisting of a technical expert and a former judicial officer to review the notice.The law says the Australian authorities cannot ask a company to build universal decryption capabilities or introduce systemwide weaknesses. But security experts and tech companies like Apple said that did not reflect what they would have to do to comply with an order. It is impossible, for example, to create a workaround for one iPhone’s encryption without potentially introducing something that could work for all of them, they said.“All of Australian technology is tarnished by it,” said Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of the founders of Atlassian, a business software company that is among Australia’s biggest tech companies.ImageSarah Moran, whose Girl Geek Academy teaches young women to code in Australia, is now asking herself, “Why would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there’s not going to be any tech industry?”CreditAsanka Brendon Ratnayake for The New York TimesAustralia is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and it is not the only country in the alliance with a law like this. Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act in 2016. For British law enforcement to gain access to data, it must first ask a judicial approver.“We’re not the first,” said Michelle Price, chief executive of the nonprofit Australian Cyber Security Growth Network. “But Australia’s version has gone much further.”Apple officials called the law “dangerously ambiguous” and “alarming.”“Encryption is simply math,” Apple wrote in a statement submitted to the Australian Parliament’s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on Oct. 12. “Any process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.”But politicians said the risk of encryption technology’s being used by terrorists was too significant. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said in July, “The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.”Technology companies in the United States have argued that they cannot be compelled to create tools for breaking the encryption in their products because computer code is a kind of free speech protected under the First Amendment. But building tools to satisfy the Australian authorities would essentially make that argument moot. Countries around the world could demand access to the tool.Apple is hardly the only tech company that could feel the impact of the Australian law. Anyone with a website is considered a communications provider, subject to the law. Any company that “provides an electronic service that has one or more end-users in Australia” is required to comply.A long list of companies meets that description, such as smartphone makers and Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.“Once WhatsApp, for example, builds a system at the behest of the Australians, everyone gets to use it,” said Nate Cardozo, the senior information security counsel on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s legal team, who has studied the new law.The law allows government agencies like the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or the Australian Federal Police to compel tech companies to install software on a user’s device to get around encryption. It can also compel the company not to alert the user.“So if WhatsApp gets one of these notices and does not comply, they’re subject to asset seizure and even hypothetically having executives hauled into jail for contempt if they refuse to do so,” Mr. Cardozo said.There is confusion about other secrecy requirements of the law. For example, would it require employees who received requests to keep them secret from their employers? The Australian Department of Home Affairs, which coordinates strategy and leadership of the country’s national security policy, says it would not. But security experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and at companies like the password manager 1Password say it is actually unclear.Australia does not have a strong tech industry, but it is growing, with investors and start-ups and a few established companies. And in the tightknit tech community that does exist, the new law has been a gut punch.ImageA Girl Geek Academy session in Melbourne, Australia. Supporters of the nation’s new law say security workarounds are needed to fight terrorists who exploit encryption technology.CreditAsanka Brendon Ratnayake for The New York Times“We never thought it would pass,” said Alan Jones, chief executive of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney. “We all just figured that Australia’s political leaders would consider the expert advice that told them this was nuts.”Sarah Moran, the chief executive of Girl Geek Academy, which teaches young women to code, said she had planned to begin tech start-ups in Australia until the law passed.“I was looking to found two tech companies, but why would you build tech here now?” she asked. “I don’t think the government understands how drastically it impacts not just the tech that’s built here but also the enthusiasm and entrepreneurial investment that Australians will be willing to make.”Ms. Moran, who is based in Melbourne, said she was questioning even the program she currently runs. “Why would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there’s not going to be any tech industry?” she asked.Casey Ellis, 37, was raised in Sydney but lives in San Francisco, where he runs a cybersecurity firm called Bugcrowd. He has already heard about companies that have become wary of hiring Australian firms, he said.“People are factoring it in as a risk when you’re looking at hiring an Australian now,” Mr. Ellis said. “It’s causing a chilling effect around Australian companies.”"

Both companies charge $9.99 a month for subscriptions, though Spotify still has more total U.S. listeners than an Apple thanks to an ad-supported free tier of its service with fewer features. Analysts also believe Spotify has a stronger subscriber position than Apple outside the United States.Neither Apple nor Spotify disclose country-level listener data, and both firms declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Apple has overtaken Spotify on the metric.Apple's streaming service is part of a broader push at the company to make money off subscriptions and services as iPhone sales slow. Last month the company announced a news, television and gaming subscriptions, as well as a credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Spotify likely still has more paying users than Apple Music, with 96 million premium subscribers and 207 million month active users as of its most recent earnings report in February. The company said in its report that it has 28.8 million premium subscribers and 62.1 million monthly active listeners in its North American region, which includes Canada but not Mexico.Apple does not regularly disclose how many subscribers it has, and the last official count - 50 million - came almost a year ago in May of 2018.About 67 million of Spotify's premium subscribers are outside of North America, the company said in its most recent quarterly report.

5c54270c3a125f5075c07861,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/apple-facebook-privacy.html,"The ongoing tension between Apple and Facebook flared again this week, causing a dramatic hubbub in the tech industry. I’d argue it was a nothing burger. Not because it was unimportant, but because it’s clear that despite persistent evidence that our privacy is being violated, it might not matter. Basically, the two digital giants engaged in an esoteric tussle over how Facebook did an end run around Apple’s very strict rules about data use on its app platform in order to suck up more user data. Through an app intended for internal use, Facebook paid people — including teenagers — $20 a month to track everything they did online. Since Facebook had been warned about this kind of thing before, Apple — noting the move was in “clear breach of their agreement” — retaliated by cutting off the oxygen, and Facebook’s access to its own internal apps. It did not, as many suggested it should, shut off other popular consumer-facing offerings on the iPhone like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.Shall I explain more? No, I shall not, because the details hardly matter, except to note that what Facebook did is the equivalent of sneaking out of the house after the curfew your parents imposed after you last sneaked out of the house. To put it more plainly, it was obnoxious and squirrelly and just the kind of behavior that we all now assume the company is capable of. Which is to say, we don’t trust Facebook in any way when it comes to using and protecting the data we entrust to it.[Kara Swisher will answer your questions about this column on Twitter on Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern: @KaraSwisher.]And neither does Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, is clearly getting on Mr. Cook’s last nerve. I feel a little responsible for the acrimony, since it was in an MSNBC interview I did with Mr. Cook in March that the older, more seasoned executive decided to go full-bore on the young, leadership-challenged one.At the time, Facebook was in the news for the rampant abuse of its platform by Russia, so I asked Mr. Cook about data abuse. He started by comparing Apple’s business model to one like Facebook’s: “The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer — if our customer was our product. We’ve elected not to do that.”Then I asked: What would he do to fix it if he were Mr. Zuckerberg? His devastating answer: “What would I do? I wouldn’t be in this situation.”Ouch. In Silicon Valley terms that response was akin to Cardi B beefing on Nicki Minaj, except quantumly more geeky. There was a sharp intake of breath from everyone in tech, and a very pissy response from Mr. Zuckerberg, in which he called Mr. Cook “extremely glib.”He then asked his employees to use Google’s Android phones instead of iPhones “because it is the most popular operating system in the world.”Uh huh. Except that seems not to have worked and clearly many of his employees ignored the directive. There were reports that iPhone users at Facebook were left stranded this week when Apple cut off the company’s ability to use other beta and internal apps on the iOS platform. Along with unreleased versions of apps, that also meant employees could not access things like bus schedules and cafeteria lunch menus. Apple has since reinstated use of those internal apps. Not knowing which fresh kombucha was being served at 1 Hacker Way obviously hit Facebook techies where they lived, which was the point. It’s interesting to compare Apple’s response this time to a comparable episode with Google. TechCrunch (which broke the original story on the rogue Facebook app) noted that Google had done a similar thing with a research app. Apple did cut off its internal apps, but there was no public hand-slapping, and the tone between the companies has been cordial. The difference: Mr. Cook has been irritated with Mr. Zuckerberg for a while, as tech companies like Apple have been lumped into the messes that Facebook has created, problems that have attracted the ire of regulators and the media.It is not just Mr. Cook. A top executive at another tech giant termed it the “Facebook contagion,” and added, “they are infecting all of tech with their sloppy mistakes.”But what’s most remarkable is how much Mr. Cook has become the critic-in-chief for Facebook. It gets harder to play that role, however, when Apple makes mistakes, too. This week we learned that its FaceTime service had a significant bug that allowed people to spy on other people’s phones. Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota both criticized Apple for being slow to reveal the issue to the public.It was too slow. But in the end Apple was properly apologetic and did shut down the glitch. Still, it’s not a good look to have a major privacy snafu right after touting your commitment to privacy.And it comes at a dicey time for Apple, which recently warned it was seeing weaker financial results and is under pressure to introduce even more new and innovative products. There is no rest for Mr. Cook, and many observers, including me, have posited that the next years for Apple will be challenging. Still, it’s interesting that Mr. Cook climbed out on this limb anyway. Some insiders at Facebook are alleging he did so to get the heat off Apple’s troubles. But that’s a canard. Mr. Cook has long been vocal about distinguishing Apple from Facebook when it comes to user data and the importance of protecting privacy.The bigger problem is that such an important issue might turn out to be the real nothing burger. Facebook turned in another stellar quarter this week, which made its stock rise strongly. So despite all the sketchy things the company is accused of doing by Apple and many others, most investors and analysts don’t seem to care, and they will never care, as long as its digital advertising business — goosed by its astonishing and nakedly ambitious ability to suck in data, data and more data from all of us — continues to impress. Simply put, Wall Street does not care.

5cad8b5049f0eacbf1f823af,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/10/technology/10reuters-china-smartphones-sales.html,"SHANGHAI — Shipments of mobile phones to China fell 6 percent in March compared with the same year-earlier month, official figures showed on Wednesday, as slowing economic growth took a toll on the sector.The shipments dropped to 28.4 million units in March from 30.2 million units in March 2018, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) said.March's 6 percent slide follows four consecutive months of double-digit declines.The slowdown points to continued pressure on the likes of Apple Inc, which endured a steep drop in China sales in late 2018, and its domestic smartphone rivals.The number of new devices launched by phone makers also fell, according to CAICT. A total of 52 new handsets hit the market in the month, down 35 percent from a year earlier.Last year was an anemic one for the world's largest mobile phone market, with total shipments falling 15.5 percent, CAICT data shows. The weakness continued in 2019 - February shipments totaled 14.5 million units, the lowest since February 2013 and a 19.9 percent decrease from a year earlier.Industry analysts generally attribute the weak performance to a slowdown in economic growth, longer upgrade cycles, and a lull in feature innovation as carriers focus on preparations for the launch 5G connectivity on their networks.To cope with the slowdown, Chinese domestic brands have been raising prices and moving upmarket, hoping to boost margins. In 2018, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Oppo, and Vivo each captured a bigger share of the $500-to-$800 price range of phones, a segment once dominated by Apple.The U.S. brand, which currently generates over 15 percent of its revenue from Greater China, has suffered in particular from the slowdown. Sales from the region during the three-month period to the end of December 2018 fell by roughly a quarter from a year earlier.Several third-party retailers have lowered prices on a range of iPhone devices this year. Apple also lowered the official sticker price of its phones after China cut the rate of value-added tax on luxury goods. (Reporting by Josh Horwitz; editing by Neil Fullick)"

Daisuke Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech he’s using.What are your most important tech tools?I’m most particular about the tech products I use as basic tools of my job. I’m a maniac about keyboards and mice; I generally hate most of them. While I use Macs at home and at work, I dislike every Apple keyboard and don’t care for the company’s mice, either. The keys are too flat, I never know if I’ve pressed hard enough, and it hurts my hands after a while.As my colleagues will tell you, I use a very loud mechanical keyboard made by Das Keyboards. These mechanical keyboards are similar to the ones that came with my family’s first IBM computer from the 1980s. I’ve also used the same mouse for the last five years.Aside from that, I use an app called Voice Record Pro on my iPhone for recording interviews. If I’m recording a phone call — with permission, of course — I’ll use an app from Rev, which is also the service I use to have my interviews transcribed. It’s a little steep at $1 per minute, but the accuracy is so much better than the A.I.-only alternatives that cost like 10 cents a minute.Why are you so particular about your mouse and keyboard? I feel like I type faster and more accurately with this keyboard — which is important because I’m already a slow typer. What’s more, the tactile responsiveness when I push a key is so satisfying. It’s silly but it also makes me feel productive, each keystroke an audio reminder that I’m one step closer to my goal.There are drawbacks. The keyboard is not as sleek and visually appealing as the Apple keyboards. They are also super loud, and the click-clacks can be distracting for people around you, as well as unsettling for people you’re on the phone with if you’re taking notes. I’ve often been stopped by sources who ask why I’m typing so feverishly, afraid that I’m pounding the keys because they said something they shouldn’t have. Now, I’ll sometimes take notes by hand using a pen and paper, and then transcribe them later if it’s a sensitive conversation.ImageDaisuke Wakabayashi prefers a mouse with heft and a mechanical keyboard.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesImageHe prefers a mechanical keyboard — colleagues might describe it as loud — made by Das Keyboards.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesMy mouse for the last five years has been a wireless one from Microsoft. It’s called the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. I like this mouse because it has good heft. Some wireless mice are too light, and they dart around like a hyperactive child. I also don’t want too big of a mouse, and then I feel like arm-wrestling with the device. This one provides a good balance. Also the bottom is plastic, and it’s quiet when I move the mouse around on my desk. The Apple ones make this cringey scraping sound. (Again, I acknowledge that I’m crazy when it comes to my computer accessories.)You cover Google, and in a past life you covered Apple. Both are fierce competitors with their own mobile operating systems, internet services, smartphones and computers. What do you see as the challenges for the companies going forward?Apple has focused on creating beautiful, easy-to-use products, but I find that its products are becoming harder to use. I think some of it is just a function of our devices being asked to do more — my iPhone is central to my life in ways that it wasn’t even three years ago — and how do you build in that additional capability without bogging down the software? Apple’s products are still beautiful, but I think that form is overtaking function in some areas. (See: headphone jack, lack of ports on laptops.) A device’s beauty is meaningful only if it is also useful.Google’s issues are different. They’re not purely product questions, but are more fundamental. The company turned 20 last year, and it feels like it’s going through an identity crisis. Google was the anti-Microsoft in the early days. Many of its longtime employees were drawn to Google not purely because it was a moneymaking machine but because it also seemed interested in being a force for good in the tech industry. Who can forget “Don’t Be Evil” and all that? ImageHe says that his iPhone is crucial in his life in a way it wasn’t even three years ago.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesBut as Google has grown increasingly dominant, it has become difficult to subscribe to a self-image of a whimsical do-gooder when everyone else sees you as Godzilla trampling across the internet landscape. We’ve already seen some employee revolts, and I suspect we’ll see more. Look at how it is wrestling with what it plans to do with search in China, which shows this identity crisis is filtering into its business and products decisions.Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with? My wife and I have a 2-year-old son, and he just loves playing with our digital speakers. We have an Amazon Echo in the kitchen and a Google Home upstairs. They’re both connected to Spotify. He knows that he can ask Alexa or Google to play “Wheels on the Bus” or “Baa-Baa Black Sheep” and, voilà, the music comes on.But these days he’s become more particular, and he likes a version of “Wheels on the Bus” performed by Mother Goose Club, so he’ll shout something like, “Alexa, play ‘Wheels on the Bus,’ the goose one, PLEEEEEEEEASE.” (We’ve tried to tell him that Alexa won’t do as he asks unless he says please.) Alexa and Google usually struggle to decipher this request, so Mom and Dad frequently intervene, but occasionally Alexa or Google understands him and he is delighted.His other favorite activity is to ask Google to play sounds of different things. His favorite requests (in no particular order): animals, emergency vehicles and modes of transportation. Recently, he discovered that Google can play the sound of a dinosaur, and this excited him to no end.But now my son thinks anything with an illuminated green ring means it’s a portal for Alexa. Recently, I found him shouting instructions to my wireless iPhone charging pad. It got me thinking, why doesn’t Amazon make an Echo that doubles as a wireless phone charging pad? My toddler the innovator."
5c5b5c433a125f5075c08603,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/technology/personaltech/children-charges-mobile-games.html,"Is your child a “whale”?A teenager once spent $6,500 on Facebook games over two weeks, according to a recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting. Some Facebook employees internally referred to these children as “whales,” a term typically used by casinos to describe the highest of high rollers.The report follows actions by the Federal Trade Commission five years ago that required Apple and Google to issue millions of dollars in refunds to parents whose children made unauthorized in-app charges. In 2017, the F.T.C. made a similar arrangement with Amazon. At the heart of all of this are mobile games that persuade children — who are the most vulnerable — to buy virtual goods using their parents’ credit card accounts while they are playing. It has become such an issue that these games have been called “bait apps” in class-action lawsuits.So what can adults do to prevent their children from falling prey to bait apps and running up their credit card bills?Unfortunately, preventing unwanted in-app purchases is far from straightforward. Many young ones are clever about finding workarounds when they are blocked. And tech companies typically don’t have much incentive to invest in safeguards because these purchases generate revenue.Jim Steyer, who runs the nonprofit Common Sense Media, said fighting bait apps is often confusing. Even though his group reviews tech products for families and suggests limits on tech, he himself often has to call tech companies to reverse charges made by his 14-year-old son inside apps like Fortnite, the popular shooter game.“It’s incumbent on the tech companies who are selling you these apps and games to make it much easier for parents,” Mr. Steyer said. “I think it’s really unfair to assume that the average parent is tech savvy.”To come up with some solutions, I gathered many gadgets in my household — including devices from Apple, Google and Amazon — to devise a guide to fighting bait apps. Here’s what you should know.AppleLet’s start with Apple, the maker of many of our devices and a purveyor of mobile games through its App Store. It offers several effective tools for restricting in-app payments on iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch.One is Ask to Buy, a set of controls that requires a parent to approve each app purchase on a child’s device. It can be set up with the following steps:A parent first sets up a family sharing account, by going into the settings app, selecting “set up family sharing” and following the instructions. The parent then sends an invitation to the child’s Apple device to join the family account. (If the child doesn’t have an Apple ID, the parent can create one and add it to the family group.)Then, the parent goes into the family sharing settings, selects the child’s account and turns on Ask to Buy. It notifies the parent’s device whenever the child tries to buy an app or something inside an app. The parent can approve or reject the purchases.You can also disable in-app payments on Apple devices altogether. Here’s how:On the child’s device settings, choose “screen time” and select “this is my child’s iPhone.”Set a secret passcode and then tap “content & privacy restrictions.” From here, tap “iTunes & App Store purchases.”Then choose “in-app purchases” and select “don’t allow.”An Apple spokeswoman said the company designed the controls to “provide families easy ways to stay informed about kids’ screen time, set appropriate limits and approve their downloads and purchases.”GoogleGoogle’s tool for managing a child’s app purchases on Android devices is incomplete compared with Apple’s. Google offers a parental control tool called Family Link, which includes a setting for requiring parental approval for app purchases. But children can choose to leave Family Link once they turn 13 and remove the restrictions — a limitation I have criticized in the past.While I do not recommend Family Link for managing a child’s app purchases, here’s an alternative method that is more reliable for regulating in-app payments on Android devices:On your child’s Android device, set a password for the Google account that is used for making purchases from Google Play, which is the Android app store. Open the Google Play Store app on the child’s device. Tap the hamburger menu (an icon with three lines) and scroll down to settings. Tap on the “require authentication for purchases” option. Then select “all purchases.”With this setting turned on, you will have to enter your password whenever the child tries to buy an app or goods inside an app. As long as you set a strong password and keep it secret, the child should not be able to make purchases. This solution is imperfect because the child will need to use a separate Google account and password for unrelated tasks, like email, but it is more reliable than Family Link because the restriction won’t expire when the child turns 13. Google declined to comment.FacebookThe process for blocking in-app payments on Facebook is the most lacking and the most confusing, I found.That’s because people can make purchases in games on the social network and on its family of apps — which include Facebook Messenger — in a dizzying variety of ways. Children can spend in games loaded inside Facebook’s mobile apps, which include Facebook and Facebook Messenger, or on a computer using Facebook.com. That means if your children are racking up charges inside Facebook’s iPhone apps, the aforementioned Apple tools will help. If they are spending inside Facebook’s Android apps, the Google solution above might stop them. But if they are buying things inside games on the Facebook website on a computer, there is no direct tool to prevent payments. The best you can do is to go into your child’s Facebook account and remove your payment method from it.In other words, if a minor failed to buy something inside a game using a Facebook mobile app, he or she could go on a computer and use the website to make the purchase, so long as your credit card was handy. This is a glaring loophole. When I called Facebook about it, a spokeswoman pointed me to its Parents Portal, which includes guidelines on how parents can talk to their children about how they use the web.Facebook does have a process for disputing charges and requesting refunds, in the games support section of Facebook. When you visit the web tool, select “process a refund,” click “purchase made by someone under 18 years old” and then choose the unauthorized game.AmazonAmazon offers games for its Fire tablets along with a range of controls for restricting app payments on those devices, which require a password to make purchases. It also offers Amazon FreeTime, which automatically blocks minors from content inside its app store.Here’s how the parental controls work:On the tablet, open the Amazon Appstore app.From there, select “account” and then tap “settings.” Then tap “parental controls” and select “enable parental controls.” With this setting turned on, the Amazon account password will be required to make in-app purchases.And here’s how to set up FreeTime:Swipe down from the top of the screen and select “settings,” and then tap “profiles & family library.”Choose “add a child profile” and create a lock-screen PIN, which your child will not have access to.From the “add child profile” screen, select “choose a profile picture” to add a profile picture. Enter your child’s name, birth date and gender.From here, you can choose “use Amazon FreeTime,” which is suited for children, or “use teen profiles,” which has an aesthetic more suited for teenagers. (Either one will automatically block in-app purchases.)Tap “add profile” and choose the content you want available on the child’s profile. Then tap “done.”FortniteFortnite is an important example of an app that is widely available across many devices. It is popular with children, who want to spend inside the game to buy different items like outfits to make their Fortnite characters look unique. The problem is that even if you prevent your children from buying virtual items inside Fortnite on an iPhone, they might make the purchases elsewhere, like on a PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo console.To prevent that, you will have to be thorough. Assess which products are in your home, and then set up the parental controls for each device, like the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.A spokesman for Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, declined to comment, pointing to the parental controls offered by device makers. Users can also request refunds for unauthorized Fortnite purchases on the company’s website.If tech fails, then what?So here’s what I learned: Fighting bait apps is a lot of work. But when tech fails, parents can always turn to a free tool: disciplining and educating their children. Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he eventually had to teach his teenage son a lesson for his Fortnite splurging. How? He took the game console away.“It does give you a teachable moment to sit down with your kid and talk about being responsible financially, and that you don’t have my permission to spend the money,” he said."
5cb416c249f0eacbf1f84115,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/15/business/15reuters-foxconn-chairman.html,"TAIPEI — The chairman of Taiwan's Foxconn, assembler of Apple's iPhones, said on Monday he plans to step down in the coming months as he wants to pave the way for younger talent to move up the ranks of the world's largest contract manufacturer.Terry Gou, speaking on the sidelines of an event in Taipei, said that while he planned to resign as chairman, he hoped to remain involved in strategic decisions regarding the company's business.When asked by Reuters if he would quit as chairman, Gou said he was moving in that direction, although any decision needed to be discussed with the company's board. ""I dont know where you got the information from. But I have to say, basically, I'm working toward that direction - to walk back to the second line, or retire ... I have been busy for 45 years. I should hand it over to young people,"" Gou said.""I will be involved in the major direction of the company, but not involved in daily operation.""I'm already 69 years old. I can pass down my 45 years of experience. That's the goal I set up - to let young people learn sooner and take over sooner and to replace my position sooner."" Gou said his plans would be discussed with the board of Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, in the coming months. ""Initially, we will tell the shareholders in the AGM in June. In the board meeting in between April-May we will give the new list of board members to the board,"" Gou said.A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Lu Sung-Ching, the chairman of Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd, the electronic and optoelectronic connectors unit of Foxconn, was among the possible candidates to take over from Guo.""It doesn't mean he will just be gone. He will remove himself to the second line and he would not be involved in the daily operations,"" the source said.Foxconn's shares rose after the news and closed 3.2 percent higher on Monday.Founded in 1974, the Foxconn group has grown to become the world's biggest contract manufacturer with T$5.2 trillion ($168.52 billion) in annual revenue, assembling goods for Apple, SoftBank Group Corp and other global tech firms. Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.The news comes three months after Reuters reported Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus.

5c574bfa3a125f5075c07d09,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/dealbook/stock-market-technology.html,"One by one, the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded. Fears that the United States economy would dip into a recession this year have eased. The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade war.But if the January snap back (it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades, after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period) is to sustain itself, big technology companies likely will have to lead the way. So far this year, they have not done that. For much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.By the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&P 500 exceeded all but two of the index’s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies’ shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.So it’s notable, then, that as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark’s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. What happened? The companies have faced a fundamental question since late last year: Could they continue to pull in new users and generate more sales in a slowing global economy? Sales growth had begun to slow in the second half of 2018 and earnings updates in January haven’t fully resolved investors’ concerns about their trajectory. “This is the first quarter in my memory that technology has on the whole had worse metrics than the S&P 500,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, referring to the earnings and revenue growth rate of big technology companies.After Apple warned of diminishing demand for new iPhones in China earlier this year, its forecast for the current quarter wasn’t as dire as many on Wall Street had feared. The stock has gained 7.7 percent since then. Still, the iPhone maker reported a 15 percent drop in revenue, including a 27 percent decline in China, and its results indicated a difficult road ahead. Its stock remains nearly 30 percent below its peak.Amazon reported record profits and revenue. But its shares were down 5.4 percent Friday in part because revenue from online shopping slowed and the growth of Prime memberships appeared to have plateaued.Microsoft shares have fallen 3.4 percent since it reported on Wednesday. Revenue at the software giant has surged in recent years as its bet on cloud computing has paid off, but there were continued signs that that acceleration could be tapering off.Facebook, whose shares were the most battered among the big tech companies last year, was perhaps the bright spot this earnings season. Despite a string of scandals, the social network generated record revenue and profit last year. Its shares have jumped 10.5 percent since Wednesday.Netflix also said revenue would grow more slowly this quarter. Its stock is down almost 3.8 percent since it reported on Jan. 17.There is a big caveat to all the hand-wringing about slowing growth: All five companies still generate huge revenue. And should Beijing and Washington reach an agreement in the trade war, sales could pick up if the global economy, particularly China’s, begins to gain speed. “There was real concern that tech was the canary in the coal mine of what would be a very dark 2019,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities covering technology companies. “Thus far a lot of those fears are proving overblown. That could set the stage for tech to make new highs this year, depending on what happens with China.”"

I Googled her parents recently (for fully innocent reasons). I knew they were wealthier than my middle-class family, but I had no idea they were buy-a-record-price-penthouse-and-make-the-headlines rich! I was shocked: My friend is humble and avoids status symbols. Still, she has immense privilege and connections that I don’t. I’m also rethinking our decision to split checks and her correcting me on minor facts. (It seems condescending now.) I think I need to raise her family wealth. You?JANELeave the rich girl alone! Our friends reveal themselves to us at their pace, not ours. This woman’s family money never affected your relationship before you went Googling. So, why force a conversation that may be hurtful to her before she’s ready? Would you be so keen to chat if you discovered she was dirt poor?You call her your “best friend,” but it sounds as if you’re still getting to know each other. The fact that you had no inkling of her family’s wealth, together with her modest manner, suggests that she’s trying to fit in — not win special advantages. The closer (and safer) you feel together, the more you will probably confide in each other.This friend is one of many people you’ll meet in college whose background differs from your own. That includes students who’ve had fewer advantages than you, too. Navigating those differences is an educational journey in itself. As you embark on it, be sensitive and try not to lean on assumptions. We’re all self-conscious.Now, I’m pretty sure you know that you’re not entitled to subsidized meals from your pal or free passes when you get your facts wrong. The real “privilege” here (to use a loaded term) is deepening your friendship with a good person. And that doesn’t depend on shared tax brackets or yachts in St.-Tropez. Be patient!ImageCreditChristoph NiemannDo We Really Need to Know?My co-worker constantly sends work emails that end with “Sent from my iPhone.” It’s fine if they’re just to me, but when our bosses or clients are involved, I think they’re embarrassing and tone-deaf. We have a close working relationship and a casual work environment. Can I say something? (She’s a tad sensitive.)ANONYMOUSLike most people I know, your poor colleague is probably responding to work emails during most of her waking hours. And like many of us, she is using a device that insidiously advertises itself with every message. Happily, there’s an easy fix to remove those branded signatures from emails. (Just go to “Settings.”)But sadly, it’s not your business to tell her. I bet you mean well, but you don’t get to decide what’s “embarrassing” or “tone-deaf” about her work unless she reports to you. Leave this to her bosses. If you just have to butt in, say: “Look! I figured out how to get rid of that annoying iPhone signature.” But don’t mention her emails.Of Renovations and GraduationsMy husband and I are in the middle of home renovations. We’re doing a lot of the work ourselves. So, our schedule and budget are tight. We’ve already agreed on family visits for the year. But now, another invitation has popped up: my husband’s cousin’s high school graduation. Most of his family are attending, but I don’t want to go. I love his cousin, but I’d rather send him money for his gap year than spend three times as much on plane fare and hotels — not to mention sitting through two ceremonies. I don’t mind if my husband goes, but do I have to join him?UNSUREOne of the great advantages of not living in a monarchy is the absence of command performances. Of course you don’t have to go! You don’t mention your husband trying to press you into the trip, so I’ll assume you’re O.K. on that front. Don’t try to steer him away from going, either (unless you really can’t afford it).Write to the young graduate: “I’m sorry I can’t make your big day. We’re in the middle of construction on our house. But your cousin is coming, and he’ll bring my love!” This response has the advantage of being reasonable and true. And rolling with unforeseen family requests is an important quality in a good partner.Some FriendsSome friends from work invited me to dinner (and kept aggressively refilling my wine glass). Then they shared what I assumed were my private remarks with higher-ups at work. I would like to clear the air, but they don’t want to address it. Should I force a hard conversation?ANONYMOUSI hate it when people tie me down and force me to drink! Start by acknowledging your own responsibility. You drank. You talked some trash (presumably) about the company. Now you have a metaphorical black eye at work. I’m sorry you feel betrayed, but I don’t see what a “hard conversation” gets you. These people are not your friends; stop pretending they are.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter."
5c9540f249f0eacbf105e913,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/multimedia/netflix-apple-tv-streaming.html,"Apple and Netflix, for better and for worse, have changed how we spend our leisure hours. In the process, the two companies have upended old media habits and created new ones. Apple’s iPhones have already ported over big portions of people’s brains, and Netflix exploded TV time slots, creating the binge and the endless content screen. Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like “Terrace House” and a Brechtian, mind-bending drama like “Russian Doll” in one place?While setting the standard in their chosen areas, Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past, for the most part. But that period of peace between the two tech giants is about to change.On Monday, Apple will unveil its most ambitious media project yet — a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, original shows and films. And when a tech giant like Apple jumps into entertainment, it’s going to create waves.Apple revealed the new products at an event in Cupertino, Calif. on Monday. Read about it here:Apple Unveils Video Service With Celebrity Parade but Few DetailsThe iPhone maker is partnering with Hollywood heavyweights and publishers to provide broad new services to its users.March 25, 2019Famous for its teasing product demonstrations, Apple will play host to Hollywood at its Cupertino, Calif., campus so that it can show off what Reese Witherspoon, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg (he of the recent Netflix-films-should-not-get-Oscars argument) have done with the more than $1 billion the company has laid out for its new ambitions.The amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the $10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than a billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix.The cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple’s iTunes store.Apple had been charging Netflix 15 percent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store. Now, new subscribers can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device, but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment details. (In the wonky world of internet transactions, where you make the purchase determines how, or if, Apple gets a cut.)In a second sign of frayed relations between the two companies, Netflix has decided to opt out of the Apple bundle, which will upsell subscriptions to HBO and CBS in addition to its original programming. Netflix’s absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed.Mr. Hastings explained it at a Netflix event earlier this week: “Apple’s a great company. We want to have people watch our service — or our content on our service. And so we’ve chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.”The key word here is “service.”Put it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company’s identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up “Stranger Things” or “Orange Is the New Black” may not be aware that they’re watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data.Apple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video — what television is fast becoming — and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers.The focus on Apple’s programming makes for a tantalizing narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, like the program set at a morning show starring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetizer. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple’s shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller.But Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many “originals,” it doesn’t actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. “House of Cards” and “The Crown,” to cite two examples, are licensed.Netflix’s programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn’t a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that’s by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn’t about any particular aesthetic, like HBO’s. It’s a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller “You” to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show “1983.”The same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels — like HBO or CBS — within their platforms.Not coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast’s broadband service can spend an extra $5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It’s meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing.A nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast — a competing distributor — and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorized to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of.Netflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has 97 million, but not all are watching its videos.Their reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly.It also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple’s service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet.Still, HBO’s inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service — which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like “Wonder Woman” and “Friends” — by the end of the year.From HBO’s perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple’s streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It’s just another sales outlet. Even HBO’s own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to five million. (HBO currently has more than seven million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.)But that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T’s own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros.) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle?It’s worth noting that Apple is hyping its new service at a time when sales of its most lucrative product, the iPhone, have started to lag. It stopped reporting how many devices it sold as of September. Now, it wants investors to look at another line item — its foray into the media business, which is stable and steadily growing. Apple hopes it will grow even faster with the help of Hollywood.Interestingly, that line item (listed as “Services” on the Apple income statement) was once little more than a balance-sheet curiosity. Now, it’s a $40 billion business. The forthcoming bundle could add more than $12 billion to that, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs.For comparison, the entirety of the Walt Disney Company generated $59 billion in sales last year. CBS, $14 billion. Netflix, $16 billion.Without explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus.So what does mean for everyone else?Mr. Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: “The game is on.”"
5cae8fce49f0eacbf1f82898,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/iphone-privacy.html,"My phone is my favorite possession. I wish I could pretend it has been some torrid courtship, that after much cat-and-mousing the two of us succumbed to our mutual attraction and decided to settle down and make an honest go of it, but I can’t: I am in breathless pursuit, hustling to keep her updated and paid for, wooing her with expensive protective cases and as many off-brand charging cords as there are outlets in my home. She acknowledges this attention with occasional notifications, blinking on the screen, reminders to update, so many needs. That makes me want her even more.I know that having her carelessly bouncing around the bottom of my bag all day and on the nightstand inches from my sleeping face, readily available for when I need to look up “recipes for morons” or “the best way to wash a cat,” is putting my precious information at risk. My phone is always listening, and through a series of bloops and bleeps I do not understand, the data I have spewed into the universe gets sold and fed back to me in a targeted Instagram ad for whatever it is I now urgently need.I don’t know how thrilled I am to be giving up my secrets, but it’s foolish to think I have any control over them, and ultimately I don’t care. I love convenience and entertainment too much to worry about how much information I cannot control is being leaked to marketers, retailers, the government and whatever Chinese intelligence agency controls the barrage of ads for $13 dresses that saturate my feed.Maybe it’s because I got in the smartphone game late and have a real memory of how inconvenient life used to be.I’m staring down the barrel of my 40th year, and the first computer I bought for myself was six or seven years ago. I didn’t get my first iPhone until they’d been around for years, partly because I was like: “Who needs that? I prefer to live in the real world!” but mostly because the idea of walking around with a $500 computer in my pocket seemed dangerous. And the idea that I could somehow scrape together the money to purchase said pocket computer while also maintaining a roof over my head (read: partying all the time and paying for cable) was hilarious and unrealistic. I was the last dinosaur at the club sending multi-tap texts on a Nokia E51 with no camera.When I finally upgraded, I didn’t get what all the fuss was about. O.K., sure, this glowing rectangle in my bag can tell me the weather anywhere in the world at this exact moment, but who cares? Wait, it can also figure out exactly what wrong street I’m turning down and steer me back in the right direction? And it counted how many steps I took? While also storing all the passwords I can never remember? Please excuse me while I build this shrine to the new most important thing in my life.That is how it gets you. I was a skeptic and then I was a convert almost immediately. I have long understood that I am a tiny, powerless cog in the wheel of modern America, plus I’m not a hacker, so what do I even know about keeping things hidden? Is it even possible for me, a regular person who cannot figure out how to program the television remote, to circumvent the eyes of all of the faceless technology corporations analyzing my information? What am I going to do, cheat Amazon? Outsmart Google? No, I’m going to do what everyone else does: enter my credit card information when prompted and get that thing I need two days from when I decided I needed it.A few months ago I went to dinner with the kind of people whose idea of fun is to correct your pronunciation of “niçoise,” and they boldly suggested that we all put our phones face down in the center of the table for the entirety of the meal and what felt like a needlessly lingering discussion afterward.Now, I didn’t die. But I also didn’t know what time it was. Or if anyone had texted me. And I’m not really a “post a picture of my fancy meal” kind of person, but I could tell that other people wanted to. The air was heavy with missed opportunity. And you know what we talked about while cringing internally as the carafe of still water we actually had to pay for came perilously close to splashing on our helpless devices every time it was passed? TV shows, which you can watch on a phone. Books, which, if your eyes haven’t already burned through the back of your skull from being on your phone all the time, you can read on your phone. Murder podcasts, which are specifically made to be listened to on a phone.[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]Yes, your phone is potentially hazardous to whatever semblance of security you might have. Yes, there are many medical professionals who would attest to the deleterious effect modern technology has on the brains and interpersonal skills of adults. But hear me out: Maybe it’s worth it?My phone knows so much about me. It knows where I am, how many steps I took to get there, the whisper of a thought I don’t remember even fully forming in my brain that somehow made its way to a search engine. It also knows I am addicted, which is why it doesn’t ever really have to worry about whether I’m creeped out by the digital eyes I can feel looking over my shoulder.Not long ago, Apple put a screen-time feature on the iPhone that’s supposed to, I don’t know, shame me into putting down the drug it won’t stop selling me. I use the statistics it collects as a challenge to spend even more time messing around on my phone. Only one hour and 37 minutes of social networking yesterday, you say? Let me put this informative book I was reading down and try to top that. But my phone already knows that’s what I’d want to do.Samantha Irby (@wordscience) is the author of the essay collections “Meaty” and “We Are Never Meeting in Real Life.”Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.glossary replacer

5c6e76fd3a125f5075c0ac1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/well/whats-covered-under-medicare-a-new-app-may-leave-you-still-wondering.html,"Millennials, beware: Your grandparents are about to start calling you for help downloading the new Medicare smartphone app.The iPhone and Android app, which launched Feb. 6, is called “What’s Covered,” and true to its name, it mostly answers one simple, yes-or-no question: Is this medical procedure covered by traditional Medicare?Milt Roney, a 71-year-old retired government worker in a well-to-do suburb of Washington, D.C., agreed to check out the app with me, though he was skeptical from the outset.“I wouldn’t use an app like that,” Roney said. “[My procedures are] going to be covered, and I’m not going to worry about it.”Still, the app, available free from the Google Play and Apple App stores, is part of a broader Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ initiative, called eMedicare, to put more tools and information about Medicare online. (CMS declined a request for an interview.)But much like the medicare.gov website, it doesn’t delve into individual beneficiaries’ specifics. It doesn’t ask what other coverage he or she might have, so it can’t take into account supplementary insurance, deductibles, coinsurance or other factors that determine cost.“While usable and good for general information, it doesn’t provide personalized information that might be more helpful in making treatment or access decisions,” said Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit organization.Milt’s wife, Lisa Roney, 70, joined him to participate in my own “expert panel,” to download the app and try it out.It’s worth noting that these experts were my backup plan. The first couple I approached told me that they’d love to help, but they had “dumb phones” and wouldn’t be able to download anything.This highlights perhaps a more fundamental problem. Many people of Medicare age don’t have a smartphone, and aren’t familiar with apps or comfortable manipulating screens.According to a report from AARP, 46 percent of people in their 60s do not have smartphones. Only 29 percent of the 70-and-older crowd do. The report suggests that the trend will tick upward, with more older Americans owning mobile technology each year.The Roneys both have Medicare Part A and B, which covers hospitalizations and doctor visits. They both have smartphones. As retired government workers, they also both have insurance from GEHA, the Government Employees Health Association, which covers their dental care, prescription drugs and some other expenses. Milt Roney gets some money from GEHA to hand out brochures at health fairs.They consider themselves pretty tech-savvy. They have iPads, personal computers and iPhones. Lisa Roney wears a Fitbit.But they immediately questioned the necessity of the app.“I’d just pick up the phone and call if I had a question about what was covered,” Milt Roney said.“I’d probably just look it up in the [Medicare] book,” Lisa Roney said, pulling the 2-inch manual from a drawer in her office.Then came the first hurdle: downloading the app.Searching “Medicare” in the Google app store, which is where Android users go, yielded many results. “What’s Covered” was first on the list, but it’s far from the only Medicare-related app on the platform. Same experience in the Apple app store, where it took the Roneys a few minutes to sort out exactly which one was the CMS tool. (It’s the one that says “Official Medicare coverage app,” made by the “Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.”)Having completed this part of the process, we moved on.Opening the app immediately gave each of us a search bar to type in a product or service. (I was experimenting, too, though still 40 years shy of Medicare eligibility.) There’s also an option to browse all items and services to see what is covered.A note to readers: I wouldn’t recommend telling your friends you have a fun new game on your phone and then ask them to call out medical procedures to see if they’re covered by Medicare. I can say from experience, it will not make you the most popular 20-something at brunch.The Roneys’ next challenge: figuring out the “search” function.Lisa Roney typed in “dexa scan,” a test her doctor recommended she, like many women her age, undergo to check for osteoporosis.It yielded no results. To find it, Lisa had to browse through the list of covered procedures and go to “bone mass measurements.” There, she found out that Part B covers such tests once every two years, but nowhere in the information did the word “dexa scan” —the term her doctor used — appear.Along the way, she checked her coverage manual and found no additional information. And, in the time it took her to go through these steps, her husband, Milt, got fed up and just Googled it. He found the answer immediately.Such problems with search specificity may be common. One reviewer on the Apple Store lodged a similar complaint.“You have to know the correct terms or browse the entire alphabetical index and select likely candidates,” the user wrote. “For instance ‘knee brace’ comes up with nothing (you have to know to search for generic term ‘brace’).”Ultimately, the app is just another way for beneficiaries, their families and providers to find the same information available on the website and printed in the old-fashioned paper manual they receive by mail. It even uses the same fonts and little apple icons that denote which procedures count as “preventive.”Ms. Schwarz, from the Medicare Rights Center, said a lot of beneficiaries will use the electronic resources to figure out coverage, but they also get help from social workers, volunteers at nonprofits and family members in their research. The app might help those people access information when they don’t want to use the mobile medicare.gov site, which Ms. Schwarz called “not particularly great.”There is also no information about how to choose a prescription drug plan, or other supplemental insurance like Medicare Advantage or Medigap plans, which are the real and complicated decisions beneficiaries must contend with. But those decisions require more personal information, which the app can’t support right now.It’s also important to remember, Ms. Schwarz said, that Medicare doesn’t cover only seniors. People of all ages with disabilities also rely on Medicare for health coverage, and they might find the app easier to use than the traditional website.The Roneys were unimpressed.“I’m probably going to delete it right after you leave,” Lisa Roney concluded.Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. It is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."
5c9e172b49f0eacbf105fbec,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/technology/lyft-autonomous-cars.html,"Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:A lot of people are getting way more interested in putting fully autonomous cars on the road.With Lyft's initial public offering on Friday, and Uber’s expected in the coming months, investors are effectively placing bets on autonomous vehicles. The development of driverless technology is central to both companies’ becoming profitable and making good on their valuations of tens of billions of dollars.Uber and Lyft want robocars to navigate city streets alone so they can offer rides 24-7 without having human drivers share their takings. Lyft admitted in its I.P.O. prospectus that without autonomous vehicles, “our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.”So the companies need to test the technology in the real world, aggressively. And investors will want that to happen. But the technology still lags behind the hype.Waymo, broadly considered to be the market leader, has pushed widespread testing of its vehicles for years. It is testing an autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix that is used by paying members of the public.But according to a report by The Information, things aren’t going smoothly. Almost 40 percent of Waymo’s customers registered complaints in reviews seen by the publication, from wrong turns to near-crashes. “This buggy and concerning service should not be charging money yet,” one customer reportedly wrote.Ambitions to push harder are also softening. “Currently, the company doesn’t believe it is close to being able to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis without safety drivers,” The Information wrote.Investor pressure on Uber and Lyft will probably influence decisions about holding off on accelerated testing, which raises questions about how strictly cities and states should regulate self-driving vehicles. Some jurisdictions are liberal, even allowing some cars to be tested without safety drivers; others are more strict.Mark Fagan, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, thinks city and state authorities should allow testing of vehicles only where safety improvements are “unambiguous.” Maybe that means airport shuttles, low-speed taxi pods or some other uses that are safe even if they are … well, a harder sell to investors.“I’m on the side of safety and security and over-testing,” Mr. Fagan says. “Rather than letting the market do its thing.”Apple Has Inertia on Its SideIn the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled a digital services plan last Monday — new TV programming, video games and news, as well as a credit card.The announcement was heavy on big names. A cast of Hollywood stars announced the streaming service, its news offering included publishers like The New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, and its credit card is backed by Goldman Sachs.Beneath the gloss, questions lurked. There were no details about pricing of the TV service. It’s unclear how much content readers will have access to in the news service. The Journal is offering just a curated selection, for instance. And there were no details about credit limits or interest rates for the credit card.Still, Apple has the inertia of its ecosystem to fall back on. It has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. Users have bought 300 million in-app subscriptions to services belonging to Apple and third parties.“If they are any indication of how Apple is leveraging their current iOS users, then they’ve been able to leverage them pretty well,” Annette Zimmermann of the research company Gartner said.A Warning Sign for TechIf a commodities slump indicates impending economic issues, tech may have a problem.Samsung Electronics warned on Tuesday that its financial results for the first three months of this year would be disappointing. It pointed to its memory and display businesses, which account for 43 percent of its revenue.Memory and displays appear in almost all electronic devices, but are sensitive to supply and demand — like a tech world equivalent of oil. There is currently excess inventory and weak demand for the components: See, for instance, a 7 percent decline in global smartphone shipments during the fourth quarter of 2018.Samsung says it “expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.” Competitors probably feel the same.Grindr, a Spy Tool?It’s 2019, and a dating app is considered a potent security threat.The Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun is reportedly being forced to sell Grindr, the popular gay social network that it bought in two stages in 2016 and 2018, according to Reuters, which cited unidentified sources. That’s the result of an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American operations.“This appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted that foreign control of a social media app could have national security implications,” David E. Sanger wrote in The Times.It’s not too surprising. China is no stranger to cyberespionage, and some data on Grindr is highly personal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is supposed to be playing closer attention to data as a security risk, and has the power to unwind deals.But it’s a clear sign that United States trust in China’s digital operations has worn paper-thin.In other news:■ Google’s robot reboot is all about software.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start with the bitterly cold weather in much of the U.S. and the new round of trade talks with China.ImageThe Chicago River on Tuesday.CreditNolis Anderson for The New York TimesWelcome to the age of weather extremesIt will be colder in the Midwest today than in Antarctica, and more than 50 million people from the Dakotas to Pennsylvania are under wind chill warnings or advisories.Here are the cold, hard facts about the dangerously low temperatures in much of the U.S. this week.In Australia, temperatures reached 116 degrees Fahrenheit last week in Adelaide. The country has experienced drought for so long that some children have hardly experienced rain.While not all of these extreme events can be attributed to climate change, the profound changes in the earth’s atmosphere raise “the likelihood of a large number of extreme events,” one scientist said.The details: Our maps show the polar vortex.Voices: “I’m cold and I’m afraid.” The lowest temperatures are expected tonight, and homeless people are particularly at risk.ImageFrom left, Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director; Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director; and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, testified in the Senate on Tuesday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesIntelligence chiefs’ priorities are at odds with Trump’sNorth Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear stockpiles, and Iran isn’t trying to make a nuclear bomb, according to an intelligence assessment of global threats released on Tuesday.

5c6dab163a125f5075c0aa70,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/technology/personaltech/samsung-s10.html,"ImageThe Samsung Galaxy FoldCreditSamsungSAN FRANCISCO — It’s hard to imagine how smartphones could get much better. Most are already zippy and equipped with jumbo screens, powerful cameras and face scanners. So what else can we look forward to?It turns out, plenty. For a peek at the future of the phone, look to Samsung, the world’s largest handset maker. On Wednesday, the South Korean company showed off a family of four new Galaxy phones that incorporate new technologies and features that may start spreading to other smartphones.Of the four new devices, one will work on next-generation ultrafast 5G cellular networks, which means it can download a movie in seconds rather than minutes. Three of the models will have slightly larger screens and more complex camera systems than their predecessors. And Samsung is also teasing a fifth device that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase the phone’s screen size to suit its owner. It is expected to be available in the United States on April 26 and in Europe on May 3. There’s a lot to unpack here. Here’s what you need to know about what’s coming with screen sizes, cameras, 5G and the elusive foldable phone.Phone screens keep getting bigger. Why would I want this, and won’t this add volume to my pocket?Many phone makers, including Samsung, Apple and Google, have focused on making screens larger without adding bulk to their bodies. To do this, they stretched the screens from one edge to another while shrinking the bezels, or the borders surrounding the screen.Samsung is continuing this trend. Its new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus phones have 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch displays, up from the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch screens on last year’s Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Even though the screens are bigger, Samsung said, the devices’ body sizes are more compact than their predecessors.The company also unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G, its first phone to work with 5G networks, which will have a jumbo 6.7-inch screen. In addition, it showed the Galaxy S10E, a model with a 5.8-inch display in a body that is smaller than the S9’s, for people who prefer more compact devices.ImageThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditSamsungWhy would you want a bigger screen? When upgrading devices, people are increasingly gravitating toward phones with larger displays. Many feel that they are getting more bang for the buck with bigger screens, as studies have shown that people spend more time using apps, watching videos and browsing the web on big-screen phones.Why would I want a foldable phone?Samsung first showed a prototype of its foldable phone at a conference for software developers last year. When folded up, it looked like a phone with a small screen, and once unfolded, the screen doubled in size. At a media event on Wednesday, Samsung shared some details about its foldable device, Galaxy Fold. It has two screens — a smaller one and a larger one — with a hinge in the middle containing multiple interlocking gears. When folded up, the viewable screen measures 4.6 inches. Unfolding the device reveals its 7.3-inch display, which is the size of a tablet screen.Samsung said it was working with Google, YouTube and others to develop apps that seamlessly transition between a single screen when folded up and the double screens in unfolded mode.You may want a foldable phone if you love tablet computers. Plenty of people enjoy using tablets like Apple’s iPad and Amazon’s Fire Tablet for their roomy screens that are upward of seven inches diagonally. That makes watching videos, reading books and playing games more enjoyable. The downside is that tablets are so large that they aren’t pocketable. A foldable phone, in theory, will let people have a tablet that can be folded up and carried in a pocket.Other phone makers are expected to jump on this trend. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, posted an image on Twitter this month teasing a foldable phone that will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, the tech trade show in Barcelona, next week.Foldable phones raise plenty of questions. When folded, the device becomes thicker in the pocket, which might make it bulky and uncomfortable. And it’s unclear whether making the displays bendable also makes them more fragile when dropped. Smartphones already have many cameras. Why would I need more?Many newer smartphones include multiple camera lenses that let you produce different camera effects. For example, last year’s iPhone XS included a rear camera with dual lenses; the two lenses worked together to blur the background while sharpening a subject in the foreground, producing what’s known as the bokeh effect.ImageCreditSamsungSamsung’s new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus take this up another notch. Both include a triple camera system arranged horizontally on the back of the phone. The left lens is for zooming, the middle lens contains the main camera, and the right lens features a brand-new ultrawide angle lens for capturing broader shots, like landscapes or a big group gathering at Thanksgiving dinner.What’s more, the Galaxy S10 5G will have a fourth camera for depth-sensing, which will enable richer augmented-reality applications that use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through the smartphone lens.Expect other companies to keep beefing up the number of cameras this year. Apple also plans to add another camera to some of its next iPhones, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Apple declined to comment.What’s the big deal about 5G?Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 5G will be one of the first phones to work with 5G wireless networks, which are a successor to current 4G networks. These new networks will introduce internet speeds so fast that devices will be able to download high-quality videos in a few seconds.But contain your excitement for now. The carriers are still far from deploying a broad 5G network. AT&T said it should have 5G deployed in 21 cities in the first half of this year. Verizon Wireless just did its first 5G data test on a smartphone late last year. There isn’t expected to be much traction for the new cellular technology until 2020.And even when 5G does reach your hometown, there may be confusion about it. In a controversial move, AT&T said that it planned to give different flavors of 5G different names: 5G+ will be the fastest speed taking advantage of brand-new infrastructure, and 5GE will essentially be a faster version of 4G using upgraded 4G equipment.Gordon Mansfield, an AT&T executive, said the labels would be helpful indicators for people with 5G phones. The 5GE icon on a phone screen will inform them they have speeds that are faster than the current 4G networks, and the 5G+ indicator will mean they are getting the fastest speeds possible, he said.Also unclear is how much it will cost for people to buy 5G access — and whether the tremendous speeds will encourage consumers to burn through their cellular data faster than they did with slower technologies. The carriers have yet to announce pricing for data plans using 5G.[What is 5G? Here’s what you need to know about the new network.]Phones have become costly, in some cases exceeding $1,000. Can we expect prices to continue climbing?Yes, in the high-end phone market, where Samsung and Apple compete. The Galaxy Fold, which arrives in stores late April, will cost $1,980.Samsung has not announced pricing of the Galaxy S10 5G, though the device is expected to top $1,000, in part because of its 5G compatibility and depth-sensing camera lens.For Samsung’s phones with more incremental changes, prices are also up.Prices start at $750 for the Galaxy S10E, $900 for the S10 and $1,000 for the S10 Plus. Compare that with the S9 and S9 Plus, which started at $720 and $840.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said she was doubtful that prices could go up much more in the near-term. The $749 iPhone XR, which despite rave reviews has not sold as robustly as some had anticipated, demonstrated that consumers may have hit a threshold.“We’re getting to a point where people will say, you know what, the technology is enough for me — I might want a different phone, but I don’t want more,” she said."

And a new series based on a memoir by a disabled gay 20-something hits Netflix.What’s on TVGAME OF THRONES 9 p.m. on HBO. Some have spent the past week celebrating the fact that spring has sprung. Others have had something else in mind: Winter is coming. That tagline for HBO’s fantasy colossus, which has grown bigger and bigger since its 2011 debut, has reached peak relevance in the lead-up to the show’s eighth season, which promises a final showdown between the living and the undead White Walkers (who have an ice dragon!). Season 8 should tie up loose ends while answering the big question of who will ultimately win the throne? Regardless of the answer, the brand is all but guaranteed to actively live on. “Five years from now,” the “Thrones” star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau recently told The New York Times, “We will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land.”ImageDominic West, left, and David Oyelowo in “Les Miserables.”CreditLaurence Cendrowicz/BBCLES MISÉRABLES 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dominic West stars as the Jean Valjean to David Oyelowo’s Javert in this adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel, about the pursuit of love and differing ideas of justice in 19th-century France. You won’t find musical numbers (or Russell Crowe’s pipes) here; this version by the “House of Cards” writer Andrew Davies favors spoken dialogue over singing, and markets itself as a faithful retelling of Hugo’s story.What’s StreamingImageRyan O’Connell in “Special.”CreditNetflixSPECIAL Stream on Netflix. The writer Ryan O’Connell made a name for himself blogging on the pop culture lifestyle site Thought Catalog, then released a memoir, “I’m Special, and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves,” about his experiences as a disabled gay 20-something. That book provides the basis for this new dark comedy series, which stars O’Connell (a first-time actor) playing a version of himself, with roughly 15-minute-long episodes. The series’s overarching joke “is on people who aren’t disabled, and how they view disabled people,” he recently told The Times. O’Connell said that “giving them a show like ‘Special,’ which is funny and I’m the one making the jokes and I’m the one writing them — I think it makes them feel at ease. They’re like ‘Oh O.K., this isn’t some scary thing. Disabled people are just like me!’ I don’t know why this a revolutionary concept. I just think they don’t know what to do with us at all.”STEVE JOBS: THE MAN IN THE MACHINE (2015) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Alex Gibney anatomizes the legend of Steve Jobs in this ambitious documentary, which charts the Apple leader’s rise and dissects his image as both businessman and transformer of culture, with one eyebrow firmly raised. In his review for The Times, Nicolas Rapold wrote that Gibney’s film “is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs.” But, he noted, “even if this isn’t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across.”"

5c8eba7249f0eacbf105d8fc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/business/media/apple-content-hollywood.html,"Apple is coming to Hollywood.Delete that.Hollywood is going to Apple.On March 25, a delegation of producers, studio executives and big-name actors will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., for one of those Apple showcases, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists.This time around, the focus won’t be on the next must-have device. With iPhone sales showing signs of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the company’s billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.The premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming before the year is out. At next week’s presentation, Apple is expected to reveal details of what it has been working on with stars from both sides of the camera like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg.The tag line, “It’s show time,” appeared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new patrons.Apple didn’t need stars before, but it needs them now. Although the company was the first publicly traded American firm to be valued above $1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue.So the plan now is not only to sell devices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways.Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Disney Company and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace.Apple has decided to put more emphasis on its services — think Apple Music and Apple Pay — to increase revenues. The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News, which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the star-studded streaming service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming.The event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino is also meant to drive home — for iPhone fans and anyone in Hollywood who hasn’t been paying attention — just how many shows Apple has pulled together. Five series have completed filming. Around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production, according to several people familiar with the shows who were not authorized to speak publicly. And the number of original productions is expected to increase in 2020.With all that new material, Apple will transform itself, seemingly overnight, from a tech giant into a more general enterprise, with a slate of original entertainment offerings sizable enough to put it in a league with Showtime, Hulu or FX.Interviews with more than a dozen people who have had dealings with Apple, all of whom said they couldn’t speak publicly about private discussions, suggest that, while the producers and stars appreciate having another deep-pocketed company to pitch, they also have … well, let’s call them concerns.Those concerns have arisen from the culture clash that may inevitably come about when a tech company that is used to guarding its trade secrets gets involved in show business, which runs on a stream of conversation, much of it of the just-between-us variety.Players expect to be kept in the loop. But many of the people working with Apple said they have received little or no information on how, exactly, their shows will be released. Or even when they will be released, other than a vague assurance of “later this year, probably fall.” They also don’t have a clear idea of Apple’s marketing plans for the shows. Or what their colleagues in the newly built Apple stable are up to.Apple’s entertainment team is based in Culver City, Calif., historically a center of moviemaking. It is led by two former Sony television executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, under the watch of the senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. Mr. Cue hired the Sony veterans in 2017, after Apple rolled out its first original series, a reality show called “Planet of the Apps,” which was a dud. About $1 billion was set aside for them to spend on programming, and they have blown well past that amount by now.While Apple may be a late arrival to the streaming party, its showcase will take place two and a half weeks before Disney is expected to preview elements of its new streaming platform, and many months before Warner Media provides details of its version.Apple’s entertainment team has not been totally opaque. It has provided feedback to individuals involved in the shows, but it has been tight-lipped about the marketing and rollout plans. The March 25 event may allay Hollywood’s concerns, but several people involved in the new programs have interpreted the lack of communication as a sign that there may not be a clear game plan.People involved in the coming series also said that Apple executives had expressed squeamishness when it comes to the portrayal of technology in the shows — how exactly are you using that iPhone? Or that Mac laptop?Apple was sensitive to a reputation it earned, early on, as a home for uplifting programming, with little or no room for the gritty antihero fare that has defined many critically acclaimed series over the last two decades, from “The Sopranos” onward. Executives at the company bristled when they discovered there would be scenes involving crucifixes in Mr. Shyamalan’s new thriller for the service, as The Wall Street Journal reported in September. But Apple ultimately allowed the crucifixes to remain, according to two people familiar with the series.Apple had no comment on any aspect of its streaming plans.Hollywood’s concerns have not prevented big names from making deals with the company. In all, Apple has ordered roughly two dozen series from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Damien Chazelle, Chris Evans and others.The producer J.J. Abrams has two Apple series in the works, one with Jennifer Garner, who played the lead in the Abrams-produced ABC series “Alias,” and a musical show starring the singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles that is about to go into production.Apple has also given the green light to animated “Peanuts” specials and children’s shows made with Sesame Workshop, and it plans to round out its offerings with films it has acquired recently at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival.The First Apple Lineup: A PreviewHere are the projects that have either completed filming or are nearing their wrap dates. They are the likeliest to appear in Apple’s first wave of shows.Untitled Series With Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer AnistonApple’s splashiest project is a behind-the-scenes series about a morning TV show. The company committed itself to two full seasons before seeing a script. Along with Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston, who are also producers, the cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass. The series had some backstage drama last year, when its showrunner, Jay Carson, Hillary Clinton’s former press secretary and a supervising producer of “House of Cards,” was replaced by Kerry Ehrin, the co-creator of A&E’s “Bates Motel.” Brian Stelter, the CNN host and author of the 2013 book, “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV,” serves as a consultant. Shooting for season one is nearly done.“Amazing Stories,” a Steven Spielberg RebootRevival of the NBC series of the same name. After its own showrunner problems — the original producer’s vision was too dark for almost everyone involved, including Mr. Spielberg — Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, the duo behind the ABC series “Once Upon a Time,” took over. Expected to wrap soon.“Are You Sleeping?” a Mystery Starring Octavia SpencerA drama featuring the prolific Academy Award winner in the lead role, “Are You Sleeping?” is based on a crime novel by Kathleen Barber that featured a cold case and a sleuth with a podcast. According to Ms. Spencer’s Instagram account, shooting finished late last year.“For All Mankind,” a Ronald D. Moore Sci-Fi SeriesThis space drama from the producer of the cult-favorites “Outlander” and “Battlestar Galactica” is a alternate-history look at what would have happened if the global space race had continued. This one is in the can.“See,” With the “Aquaman” Star Jason MomoaA fantasy epic starring the “Aquaman” star (please note, the series is not called “Sea”) that poses the question, What would happen to humanity if everyone lost their sight? Also with Alfre Woodard, who has been in everything from “Scrooged” to “Luke Cage.” Now shooting.A New Shyamalan ThrillerA thriller from the maker of “The Sixth Sense” and “Glass” starring Rupert Grint, Lauren Ambrose and Nell Tiger Free. The story is a secret. Filming has come to an end.“Little America,” From the Writers of “The Big Sick”An anthology series focused on stories of immigrants coming to the United States.

5ca441d949f0eacbf1f8069b,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/03/us/ap-us-police-shooting-wichita.html,"WICHITA, Kan. — An Ohio gamer upset over a $1.50 bet in an online game pleaded guilty Wednesday to asking a prankster to make a bogus emergency call, then trying to hide his involvement when he realized the antic had gotten a Kansas man killed by police.Casey Viner, 19, of North College Hill, Ohio, changed his plea to guilty on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. He initially pleaded not guilty.The plea deal jointly recommends two years of probation, although the judge is not bound by that sentencing recommendation. The deal also recommends Viner be barred from online gaming for 2 years.The death of Andrew Finch, 28, in Wichita drew national attention to the practice of ""swatting,"" a form of retaliation in which someone reports a false emergency to get authorities, particularly a SWAT team, to descend on an address.Authorities said Viner recruited Tyler R. Barriss to ""swat"" an opponent in Wichita over a $1.50 bet stemming from the game Call of Duty: WWII. But the address they used was old.Barriss, a 26-year-old Los Angeles man with an online reputation for ""swatting,"" called police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017, to falsely report a shooting and kidnapping at that Wichita address. Finch, who was not involved in the video game or dispute, was shot by police when he opened the door.The intended target in Wichita, Shane Gaskill, 20, is charged as a co-conspirator in the case. Authorities said Viner provided Barriss with an address for Gaskill that Gaskill had previously given to Viner. Prosecutors alleged that when Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he gave Barriss that same old address and taunted him to ""try something.""The federal indictment detailed Viner's panic in text communications after he realized someone had gotten killed and the ensuing investigation would likely unveil his Twitter conversations related to the prank. A person identified in the indictment only as J.D. texted him saying that hopefully Viner didn't say anything stupid.""I did, I literally said you're gonna be swatted. Not thinking at all, so I'm going to prison,"" Viner texted back.When J.D. apparently tried to reassure him by pointing out that Viner himself didn't call the hoax in, Viner replied, ""Does t (sic) even matter?????? I was involved I asked him to do it in the first place,"" according to the indictment.The indictment also alleged that a forensic examination of Viner's iPhone recovered his deleted outgoing messages to unknown persons, including one in which Viner allegedly wrote: ""I was involved in someone's death.""Sentencing for Viner was scheduled for June 26.Barriss was sentenced last week to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts for making fake emergency calls and threats around the country, including the deadly hoax call in Kansas. Prosecutors believe it is the longest prison sentence ever imposed for ""swatting.""Gaskill's trial has been delayed to April 23 amid plea talks with federal prosecutors."

It’s an enormous greenhouse doubling as a work space for employees: a climate-controlled, glass-enclosed, self-contained ecosystem made up of 40,000 species of plants from all over the world. Amazon executives opened the event with a statement worthy of their surroundings: The company had 70 products, services and tools to introduce. Seventy new products?  The journalists in the room responded with gasps and laughter.There were new devices like the Echo subwoofer and a tiny gadget to bring Alexa into your car. A smart plug that automatically connects to Wi-Fi and will make any smart appliance respond to your spoken commands. Amazon’s voice-operating system, Alexa, had been upgraded with a ton of new features. At the tail end of the event was something both mundane and marvelous. Situated between the staghorn ferns and tiny begonias was an Alexa-powered microwave oven that will take the fuss out of having to push buttons to pop a bag of popcorn.From my vantage point, that Alexa-powered microwave was arguably one of the most important announcements Amazon has made in the past few years. It was clear that Amazon was now using artificial intelligence to slowly transform our homes into data generation machines as we, and our daily activities, are continuously mined, refined and productized.Amazon isn’t the only company seeking to become the operating system for everyday life. Apple and Google also offer smart speakers and are partnering with appliance manufacturers. Apple has opened up its HomeKit requirements to make it easier for manufacturers and developers to incorporate its digital assistant, Siri. Google has spent the past year aggressively pushing its connected home assistant. Apple and Google also make our phones, store our photos and run our app stores. Apple just announced a new credit card paired with the iPhone. Google is making home alarm systems. Amazon is getting into the health care business. Both Amazon and Google are expanding into the electricity business, too, as they partner with utilities and deploy home energy management services.What this means is that sometime in the next decade, all the start-ups and hardware manufacturers and the rest of the A.I. ecosystem will converge around just a few systems. All of us will have to accept a new order and pledge our allegiance to one of the few companies that now act as the operating systems for everyday life. Once your data, gadgets, appliances, cars and services are entangled, you’ll be locked in to Amazon, Google or Apple. As you buy more stuff — mobile phones, connected refrigerators, smart earbuds — you’ll find that not only are your devices not compatible with other systems, you and your family aren’t either.This will create a de facto system of segregation, the beginnings of which we’re already seeing. One in 10 Americans received an Apple, Google or Amazon smart speaker during the 2018 holiday season, according to a report by NPR and Edison Research. However, those speakers, and all the peripherals sold with them, can’t be easily used across different operating systems.Users of iPhones have enhanced functionality when using an Apple HomePod, while they won’t work at all with an Android phone. (Android is made by Google.) Amazon’s clever Smart Plugs will connect your desk lamp to Alexa, but they won’t talk to Google Home. All those devices give us access to bundled entertainment packages and shopping platforms, which rely on our personal and behavioral data. Because our data are managed by one of these companies — companies that also sold us all the A.I.-powered stuff in our homes — we are unwittingly choosing our tribes. Without realizing it, you are already a Google family or an Apple family or an Amazon family.What does that designation imply for the coming years?Apple’s products tend to be the priciest, but they also come with the fewest glitches, viruses and bugs. As a result, they are attractive to people with little technical knowledge and a lot of disposable income. Apple’s future smart glasses, smart toilets and custom refrigerators might carry on the company’s long tradition of expensive devices anyone can use right out of the box. The families, wherever they call home, will be living a life optimized by a handful of developers in Cupertino.Google’s current egalitarian approach to tech could shift to a future tiered system of access and permissions. Families who can afford the upgrade fees and have enough tech savvy could manually unlock their systems and connect to a greater variety of devices, such as coffee makers, 3-D printers and outdoor irrigation systems. But a lower-income tier might offer families access in exchange for advertising. Those families would have a small selection of devices and appliances available, and they would come with restrictions and limited data protections.Since 2017, Amazon has partnered with Lennar, the largest residential construction company in the United States, to install Alexa in its houses, and there are Amazon homes all over the country: in Sarasota, Fla., in Bucks County, Pa., in Howard County, Md., and in Fresno, Calif. Even in the quiet, blue-collar neighborhood where I grew up in Northwest Indiana, there is now a cluster of Amazon homes that come with smart speakers, door locks and e-keys, video doorbells and thermostats. Amazon homes come with built-in neighborhood surveillance: Families type in the name of their community to see security camera footage from their neighbors. So it is conceivable that Amazon might one day build smart homes full of its own appliances — not just microwaves — that connect to the Amazon platform. By choosing Google, Apple or Amazon today, you are also aligning your family values with the values of one of the big tech giants. And soon, you may have to choose — making just one of these companies a custodian of all your family’s data. The unintended consequence of this kind of home automation could be a digital caste system that’s much more daunting than the prospect of making microwave popcorn the old-fashioned way.

5c5426c13a125f5075c0785a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/smarter-living/how-to-do-a-data-cleanse.html,"If we need a checkup on our health, our finances or our cars, we can find doctors, accountants or mechanics. But who checks up on our digital lives?There’s no such thing as 10,000-mile scheduled maintenance for your hard drive or an oil change for your smartphone. You’re on your own.Some people go years without giving their data much thought. As we start a new year, here’s one more item to wedge onto your New Year New You list: a comprehensive checkup on your own data.Following these four steps takes some time and attention, but it’s the only sure way to avoid eventual data disaster.Have you backed up your data?Sooner or later, your hard drive will die.Even its manufacturer admits it. Right there in the manual’s fine print, you can find its M.T.B.F. That’s “mean time between failures,” or “typical time until it croaks.”If that drive contains the only copies of your files and photos, then your countdown to catastrophe has begun.What you need is an automatic, continuous backup system — something that only 6 percent of us have set up.The easiest solution is an online backup service like Backblaze, which is preferred by Wirecutter for its low cost —$50 a year — and lack of size limits. Its software continuously copies your computer’s contents to the cloud. Should disaster strike, you can download your stuff right back again.ImageOnline backup services like Backblaze require an annual fee, but they’re entirely automated and invisible until a crisis.Better yet, these backups are offsite. Fire, flood and fiendish burglars are no longer your concern. (Well, they’re not great, but at least you won’t lose the sole copy of your data should your computer be damaged, destroyed or go missing.)The downside, of course, is paying that fee forever.For that reason, some people prefer backing up their stuff onto a second, external hard drive. Wirecutter suggests the 4-terabyte Western Digital My Book, which costs about $100.Once it’s connected, you can set up the Mac’s Time Machine feature or Windows’s File History feature to do the backing up, quietly and automatically.The drawbacks of this system: First, your backup isn’t offsite, so a local disaster can take down both the original and the backup. Second, no backing up takes place unless the external drive is plugged into your computer — something to remember if you’re a laptop lugger.There’s a third option, by the way, that’s ideal for a household with several computers. For about $300, you can buy a huge hard drive that connects to your Wi-Fi network and backs up all of your machines wirelessly.In order to scare off novices, the industry calls these drives NAS (network-attached storage) devices. They’re usually not simple to set up, but the result is free, wireless, continuous backup of all the computers in your house.Are your phone’s photos safe?Ask a hundred people what they’d rescue first from a burning house, and you’ll hear a lot of “my photos.”Dropbox, Flickr, Apple’s iCloud and other companies can back up your phone’s photos and videos, wirelessly and automatically. But they’re free only if you have a tiny photo collection. If your picture collection is of real-world size, you’ll have to pay. (It’s $36 a year for 200 gigabytes for iCloud, for example.)But two excellent services, Google Photos and Amazon Photos, can back up your complete photo collection for free, with a footnote apiece:Google’s promise: Unlimited, free backups of all the pictures and short videos on your phones, tablets and computers, with spectacular searching and sharing features once they’re online.The catch: Google’s algorithms compress your photos to take up less space. Now, unless your camera takes photos larger than 20 megapixels, it’s impossible to see the difference between the downgraded copies and the originals. Still, deep down, it may bug you to know that you haven’t uploaded exact copies. (Google Photos can back up the exact originals for a fee: $36 a year for 200 gigabytes, for example, or for free if you buy a Google phone.)Amazon Photos offers the same free service without compressing your photos. It can automatically back up either your computer’s photo stash or your phone’s (iPhone or Android).The catch: It’s part of Amazon Prime, the $119-a-year service that offers free two-day shipping, streaming movies and music, discounts at Whole Foods and other features.If you’re among the 100 million Americans who are already Prime members, great! It’s a good bet that you didn’t even know about this feature.Have you cleaned out your machine?Nobody knows where the term “cruft” came from. Maybe it began life as a reference to Harvard’s Cruft Laboratory, or maybe it’s some mash-up of “crust,” “crud” and “stuff.” In any case, that’s what it is: crust, crud and stuff that builds up over time.Software cruft refers to digital dust bunnies: duplicate files, orphaned “temporary” files, forgotten downloads, files attached to ancient emails, abandoned files from apps you deleted, and so on.Cruft is bad. As it piles up, it can waste a shocking amount of storage space. Eventually, it can slow down your machine.Fortunately, Apple, Microsoft and Google have all recently joined a global anti-cruft crusade. They’ve each added cruft-removal tools to their operating systems. You just have to remember to use them:Windows 10: From the Start menu, open Settings, System and then Storage. If you click “Free up space now,” Windows displays a list of cruft categories that it’s safe to delete, and shows how many gigabytes you’ll reclaim.Here, you can also turn on Storage Sense, which prevents cruft from accumulating in the first place. (Click “Change how we free up space automatically” to adjust the frequency of the deletions.)ImageWindows 10 offers a simple way to reclaim disk space from orphaned files.Mac: Apple’s cruft cruncher can reclaim huge swaths of space. (It’s available on macOS High Sierra and later.) To see it, from the Apple menu, choose About This Mac; click Storage; and then Manage.Here, you’ll see options like “Automatically remove watched iTunes movies and TV shows” and “Download only recent attachments” (in the Mail app). Click Review Files to see a sortable list of everything on your drive, which makes it easy to spot duplicates, or your biggest and oldest files, and delete them.ImageThe Mac, too, suggests ways to pinpoint abandoned and gigantic files for deletion.Android: Beginning with the Oreo version of Android, Google has made it fantastically easy to clean out junk files from your phone: Tap Settings, Storage & Memory, and then “Free Up Space.” The resulting list includes downloaded files, photos and videos that you’ve already backed up, and apps you haven’t used in some time. You can delete them by category or individually.ImageWhen your Android phone is feeling stuffed, open Settings to lighten its load.iOS: On the iPhone or iPad, tap Settings, General, and then iPhone Storage. You’re now facing iOS’s cruft-removal options: Offload Unused Apps, Review iTunes Videos (enormous TV and movie files), plus an app-by-app listing of space gobblers. Music, Photos, Podcasts and TV usually top the list.To delete the individual songs, videos, photos and other files that are eating up your space, you still have to open the corresponding app. But at least now you know where to begin.ImageThe iPhone and iPad make it easy to see which big and underused apps are junking up your storage.More sophisticated cruft-crunching apps are available online — some free, some not. But start with these free, built-in options.Is your software up-to-date?Every year, Apple, Microsoft and Google offer free updates to their phone and computer operating systems. Each update generally makes your machine more secure, less buggy and more richly featured.The operative word, of course, is generally. Grizzled computer veterans are full of stories about the time some upgrade fried their PCs, introduced bugs or took away beloved features.Maybe that’s why some people avoid installing the updates, which do, after all, take time to install and learn.But here’s the thing: Software companies don’t create these updates to make your life miserable, or even to make money. (The updates are usually free.) Their primary motivation is making your machine better so you’ll love it enough to buy the same brand the next time.Thanks to better (and more public) testing, it’s been a long time since any of these companies introduced a disastrous operating system release. By all means, study the reviews of the latest update. But if it seems fine, make the jump. You generally wind up with a computer or phone that runs faster, feels newer and does a better job at resisting internet nastiness.Have a Happy New YearFour steps, four nagging projects, four ways to ensure a better future for your life’s data. Having to perform this kind of nerdy checkup may not be your idea of fun, but look at the bright side: It costs a lot less than visiting a doctor, accountant or mechanic."
5c39445a3a125f5075c04078,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/canada/52-places-list.html,"Few lists from The New York Times are as eagerly awaited as Travel’s annual roundup of 52 Place To Go this year.ImageCalgary is one of The Times’s 52 destinations for travelers this year.CreditColin Way for The New York TimesLast year, Saskatoon was among the global destinations. This year, Calgary, Alberta, and Lake Superior’s ice caves near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, landed on the list along with the Setouchi Islands of Japan and Puglia, Italy, among many others.[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]Though I wrote about the ice caves, I played no role in their selection, or that of Calgary. To find out how they made the cut, I spoke with Amy Virshup, who took over as Travel editor for The Times last autumn and was immediately thrown into the compilation of the list.Readers with a good memory may recall that Calgary was also on the 52 Places list for 2014. But Amy assured me that the city’s return wasn’t a case of institutional amnesia.“The new library seemed like such an incredible building, and new buildings, new infrastructure are part of our catalog of reasons that we go to places,” Amy told me.“That it was also in a neighborhood that was kind of coming back made it interesting. Also the fact that the library is kind of unusual, with sculptures, a performance hall, a cafe, and that it is trying to redefine what a library is.”The library Amy was talking about is the city’s new Central Library. Like the relatively new main library in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which I’ve had the pleasure of visiting a couple of times, and the Grande Bibliothèque in Montreal, which opened in 2005, Calgary’s new building is defying earlier predictions that libraries would wither away in the digital age.The ice caves are on the list for a completely different set of criteria. Amy said that she and the other travel editors were looking for experiences or places that may disappear or change because of climate change — last-chance destinations.ImageThe International Bridge that joins Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario with its namesake in Michigan.CreditIan Willms for The New York Times“They were so incredibly beautiful and fascinating, the idea that they were going to go away seemed so incredibly sad to me that I thought we should highlight them,” Amy said.The caves are also not particularly well known. Since the list was published this week, I’ve heard from former residents of the Sault who weren’t aware of the natural wonders just an hour or so away from the city.If you’re curious about how the full 52 Places list comes together, Amy has put together a detailed explanation.In 2018, for the first time, we gave one writer the exhausting, if exciting, task of visiting all 52 places within the year. Jada Yuan’s accounts were a hit with readers. If you missed it in last week’s Canada Letter, make sure you read her final report on a year of nonstop travel.The 2019 traveler, Sebastian Modak, was chosen from a wide pool of applicants. He’ll take a slightly different approach, Amy told me, drawing on his background as a multimedia producer to tell his stories.ImageSebastian Modak will be traveling the world non stop this year for The Times.CreditAnnie Tritt for The New York TimesAs for Canada, Amy said that she wants Travel to take its readers to the country’s less obvious destinations.“A lot of our Canadian travel has focused on either a handful of cities or natural beauty like Banff,” she said. “But we know there’s a lot to explore in Canada.”So here’s our challenge for Canada Letter leaders: If you have a favorite destination that you think has been generally overlooked, email us at nytcanada@nytimes.com, explaining why others should visit.

5c4a5ce93a125f5075c0636f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/intel-chief-executive-search.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Intel answered many questions from Wall Street Thursday, but not the one that has dogged the company for seven months: Who will become chief executive of the giant chip maker?The lengthy search, begun after Brian Krzanich was forced out in June for a past affair with a subordinate, illustrates the difficulty of finding a leader with the diverse skills needed to run one of Silicon Valley’s most complex companies.Intel, which hosted a conference call Thursday to discuss the financial results of its most recent quarter, said its directors were conducting the search with “a sense of urgency” but gave no timetable for a selection.“I am convinced the board of directors will close on a new C.E.O. in the near future,” said Robert Swan, Intel’s chief financial officer, who is also serving as acting chief executive.Intel, which has 107,000 employees, sells the vast majority of processors that power personal computers as well as larger machines that run the web. It turns silicon wafers into chips in some of the world’s most sophisticated factories — sites that cost $5 billion to $10 billion each — and employs an army of chemical engineers, physicists, system architects, chip designers and computer programmers.The company, which turned 50 last year, has never drawn a top executive from outside its own ranks. Indeed, Intel was once known for signaling the promotion of an internal candidate to its top job years in advance.That tradition broke down with Paul Otellini’s surprise decision to resign in November 2012. Intel’s board considered external candidates before settling the following May on Mr. Krzanich, an Intel manufacturing specialist.At least seven seasoned executives departed during his five-year tenure. Analysts now see only three obvious internal choices, none of whom has the broad experience of past Intel leaders.Some promising external candidates have declined the opportunity. One is Patrick Gelsinger, a former Intel executive who is now the chief executive of the software company VMware, who went so far as to get a VMware tattoo after the search process began.Others have been considered by Intel’s board but rejected, according to five current and former Intel executives. These people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the process, said Intel directors seemed divided on what to do.Inexperience with Intel’s business could be a factor. Five of nine directors have joined the board since 2016, while three longtime members stepped down last May. An Intel spokeswoman declined to comment.A new chief executive would take the helm at an unusual time for the industry pioneer. Intel has recently reported some of its strongest-ever financial results, with revenue for 2018 soaring 13 percent to top $70 billion. Mr. Swan vowed rapid progress in entering new markets, while analysts have praised some forthcoming chips.Yet Intel’s fourth-quarter results were worse than analysts expected — as was its financial projection for 2019 — while the company faces long-term questions about maintaining its dominance. Last year Intel gave up the lead in creating ever-tinier transistors on chips, the pattern observed by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that drives down computing and data storage costs.Intel has repeatedly missed deadlines to deliver its next production recipe for smaller circuitry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which manufactures chips designed by other companies, grabbed the lead in the Moore’s Law race with chips that first appeared in Apple iPhones.The delayed production process actually boosted Intel’s bottom line last year by allowing the company to put off spending on new manufacturing equipment. But the technology stumble is eventually expected to aid other chip designers, a list that now includes Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and major customers such as Google and Amazon.After missing the huge market for smartphone processors, Intel recently supplanted Qualcomm in supplying cellular modems for Apple iPhones. But those sales lose money, a problem underscored in trial testimony this month by Aicha Evans, a veteran Intel executive who resigned days later to lead the start-up Zoox.“For us, this is a very fragile business,” said Ms. Evans, a witness for the Federal Trade Commission in a case challenging Qualcomm business practices.Whether to hang on with modems will be one key decision facing a new chief executive. But there are many other challenges, including processor supply problems that hurt PC sales in the latest quarter.“Intel’s numbers have been fantastic,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “But if you start delving below the surface, the structural issues are fairly apparent.”The internal candidates seen as favorites are Mr. Swan, though he has said he doesn’t want the position; Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, who joined Intel from Qualcomm in 2015 and oversees most product development; and Navin Shenoy, a veteran executive vice president whose unit supplies chips for computers used in data centers.External candidates who have been considered for the chief executive post, according to the current and former Intel executives, include Renée James, a former Intel president now running a competing start-up; Anand Chandrasekher, who once ran Intel’s mobile device effort and later served a stint at Qualcomm; Sanjay Jha, a former Qualcomm executive who led Motorola; and Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, whose name was reported earlier by Axios.Ms. James, Mr. Chandrasekher and Mr. Jha are no longer under consideration, these people said."

Read the 2018 recap from our 52 Places Traveler, and resolve to visit somewhere on her list this year — or at the very least, try a salchipapa or a panzerotto.DEC. 30-JAN. 5What’s Up? Apple Upsets the CartApple surprised investors by lowering its revenue forecast on Wednesday, the first time it has done so in 16 years. The company attributed its $5 billion shortfall to the sharp decline in iPhone sales in China. That spurred larger fears about the lagging Chinese economy — and whether it’s pulling American companies down with it. Apple’s stock fell 10 percent after its announcement, its worst one-day slide in six years, and suppliers that manufacture iPhone parts took a beating as well. This doesn’t bode well for the other businesses that sell to Chinese consumers.New Year, Same ConfusionIf you’re nonplused about whether the markets’ recent behavior is a bellwether of a looming economic slowdown, prepare for more mixed signals. Friday’s employment report was even stronger than expected: A whopping 320,000 new jobs were added in December, the most in nearly a year. Still, corporate revenues tell another story. In addition to Apple, Delta Air Lines reported gloomy numbers, and Tesla shares also slid after the company cut its car prices, a move that may reflect weakening consumer demand.

Experts recommend that you stick it out.Furloughed for How Long?Hours after Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, lawmakers approved measures to reopen government agencies that have been closed over a budget standoff. But the legislation will probably wither on the vine, as it doesn’t include the $5 billion that President Trump is demanding for a wall along the country’s southern border. The impasse, now two weeks long, leaves 800,000 government employees without paychecks and could soon affect other Americans’ wallets, too, by causing delays in tax refunds and in federal loan funding. Adding insult to injury, Mr. Trump issued an executive order to freeze all federal salaries for 2019.ImageCreditGiacomo BagnaraJAN. 6-12What’s Next? All Eyes on the FedEveryone wants to know whether the Fed will change its mind about continuing to raise interest rates. The central bank’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, sought to calm investors on Friday, acknowledging their concerns and vowing to “shift” policy if necessary. More hints and insights may come this Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee publishes economic projections and the minutes from its December meeting. If the documents reflect a more cautious outlook, then perhaps the Fed will go easier on rates in 2019, which could help steady markets and prevent mortgages and other loans from getting more expensive. Mr. Powell will speak again at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Thursday. China at the TableAmerican delegates will kick off trade talks in Beijing this Monday, the first time officials from both countries have met since Mr. Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, agreed to a temporary trade truce back in December. Extensive talks are planned for February, ahead of the March 2 deadline to reach an agreement. It’s not a moment too soon, as China’s flagging economy is not just hitting Apple and other American companies, but the rest of the world, too.Brexit Limps AheadAs if we needed another destabilizing factor in world trade, the British Parliament will resume squabbling this week over its plan to leave the European Union. Nothing if not dogged, Prime Minister Theresa May will pull out all the stops to avoid a defeat (or another delay) in a Brexit vote set for later this month. Britain remains deeply divided over aspects of the deal, particularly how to handle the Northern Ireland border. If no agreement is reached, Britain will be dangerously close to its March 29 deadline to withdraw. A no-deal Brexit could seriously imperil the British economy, as well as those of its trade partners.What Else?NASA photographed the farthest object in space that humans have ever encountered — a small, icy mass floating 4 billion miles away — and China became the first country to land a vehicle on the far (or “dark”) side of the moon.

The discount was posted by mistake on New Year’s Day, and customers snapped up seats before the airline discovered its error. It’s honoring the tickets anyway."
5c6746263a125f5075c0a01d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/dealbook/apple-shares-tech-hedge-funds.html,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Bets on Big Tech became, in Wall Street parlance, crowded last year.The belief that shares of the world’s tech giants — Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Netflix and Tencent — would continue to rise became universally popular among some of the biggest names in investing.Last quarter, sentiment reversed, and those same investors dumped their shares.Investment firms run by George Soros and David Tepper unloaded their shares of Apple during the fourth quarter, according to filings Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The hedge fund Jana Partners also reduced its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.Even Berkshire Hathaway, which has spent the past three years gobbling up shares of Apple, cut back its holdings in the company.And Apple was not the only tech titan that big investors were selling last quarter.Jana, along with Third Point, sold all its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Third Point exited its position in Netflix. Leon Cooperman’s firm, Omega Advisors, sold its stake in Facebook and reduced its holdings in Alphabet. And Tiger Global Management decreased its holdings in Amazon.The filings are the latest evidence of how quickly investors soured on Big Tech late last year as the industry’s woes mounted. A stream of revelations about privacy lapses and security issues had raised the specter of increased regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. But of more immediate concern for investors late last year was whether these companies could continue to grow amid a slowing global economy and an escalating trade war between China and the United States.Over the final three months of last year, tech shares dropped 13 percent to 30 percent, erasing more than $1 trillion in market value. By comparison, the S&P 500 fell 14 percent.The selling signaled a swift shift in sentiment among big hedge funds. Many of these fund managers had struggled to beat the broader market in recent years. So as tech stocks soared and drove much of the broader market’s gains, hedge funds crammed their portfolios with their shares.The selling caught the hedge fund industry off guard, and their losses mounted during the fourth-quarter tumult in the stock market.So far this year, shares of the tech companies have recovered, but most have not fared as well as the S&P 500.Earnings for the final three months of 2018 were better than investors feared, but they did not inspire confidence that Big Tech would weather a global economic slowdown well, particularly in China.Whether investors will pile back into tech stocks will probably depend on the outcome of trade talks between China and the United States. Until then, many investors may stay on the sidelines."
5cab5b9e49f0eacbf1f81992,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/08/business/08reuters-sony-thirdpoint-exclusive.html,"(Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC is building a stake in Sony Corp to push for changes that include shedding some businesses, the second time in six years it has targeted the Japanese electronics maker, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Once a market leader in consumer electronics, Sony is now in the midst of a turnaround effort spearheaded by Kenichiro Yoshida, its chief executive who formerly served at its chief financial officer.The maker of the iconic Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the likes of Apple Inc in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007. Sony over the past decade has reinvented itself as an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and its video game platform.Investors are now searching for its next source of growth as Sony's gaming business shows signs of slowing, with its popular PlayStation 4 console nearing the end of its cycle.Third Point's amassed stake in Sony thus far could not be learned. The hedge fund, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle, targeting between $500 million and $1 billion in capital, so it can buy more Sony shares, the sources said.Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the hedge fund believes has attracted takeover interest from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, the sources said. The hedge fund also wants clarity on how Sony's semiconductor and insurance divisions fit in with the rest of the company, the sources added.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sony and Third Point declined to comment.U.S.-listed shares of Sony rose 8.3 percent after the Reuters report to close at $46.65. The company, whose main stock market listing is in Tokyo, has a market value of 6.1 trillion yen ($55 billion).Sony reported lower-than-expected profit in February, dragged down by its previously thriving gaming business, even as a one-off gain related to its acquisition of music publisher EMI pushed the quarterly result to a record high.Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, writing in a letter to investors that the division remained ""poorly managed.""Some Hollywood actors and producers rallied behind Sony at the time, with actor and producer George Clooney calling Loeb ""a hedge fund guy who describes himself as an activist but who knows nothing about our business.""Later Loeb changed his tune, praising the company for cutting costs at the entertainment division and having made management changes.CINEMA HITSSony has already sold off its ailing personal computer division and streamlined its television and smartphone businesses. In taking aim at Sony's commitment to the entertainment business, however, Third Point may be facing an uphill struggle. Yoshida has said he sees synergies between the film business and its PlayStation platform, and he has been emboldened by Sony's cinema hits such as 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,' and 'Venom'. Consolidation in the sector has been intensifying amid pressure from online streaming services offered by companies like Netflix and Amazon, and with Walt Disney Co completing its $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox Inc's entertainment assets from Rupert Murdoch's media empire last month. Loeb is no stranger to challenging companies with long odds of success. Last year, he sought to oust the entire board of Campbell Soup Co, despite the founding family's members controlling much of the U.S. food company. He ended up settling for two board seats.This is the second time Third Point is looking to increase its firepower by raising a special purpose vehicle. In 2017, it raised $750 million that way to build a stake in Nestle SA. Sony last month said its chairman Kazuo Hirai, who helped engineer the company's recent revival, would retire in June.

Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, discussed the tech she’s using.What are your most important tech tools for tracking budgets?This may sound strange coming from a personal finance reporter, but I’m not a big fan of traditional budgets — I don’t think they work. I try to keep my own spending in check by taking the reverse approach. Instead of tracking every dollar, I focus on what we need to save for: retirement, college or some other goal. After you’ve automated your savings goals and created a bit of a cushion for emergencies, you’re freer to spend without thinking too hard or feeling too guilty. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s better than a failed budget. That method won’t necessarily work in all situations, especially if you need to tackle debt or establish a stricter spending plan in retirement. And everyone can benefit from tracking personal spending, even if you do it only for a few months or check in only every quarter.Mint has been around for a while, but it is still a solid way to take stock of where all of your money is going and whether your net worth is moving in the right direction. It also allows you to create a budget, and alerts you when you’ve spent too much. I use it infrequently, and there’s usually at least one kink I need to work out whenever I log in; most recently, it counted all of my retirement accounts twice, which was kind of cruel. Personal Capital, an investment advisory service, also has a robust free tool that tracks your spending, cash flow and retirement goals all in one place with minimal effort.For people who want a more proactive approach to spending and whittling down debt, there’s You Need a Budget. I’ve come across many people in my reporting who have attested that it’s life-changing.Which basic tools would you recommend for people to increase their savings and investments?It’s not so much a tool but a technology: automation. After you’ve settled on a low-cost investment provider such as Vanguard, automation is the surest way to set yourself up for success. Automate as much as you can — your Roth I.R.A. contributions, your kids’ 529 college savings accounts. If you have an employer-provided retirement plan like a 401(k), see if it will allow you to automatically increase the percentage you’re saving each year. If not, set a date in your electronic calendar to remind you to revisit all of those amounts annually.I also like the little revolution that the roboadvisers have started. They lean heavily on technology to help invest and manage your money, though more of them are increasingly integrating human advisers. Betterment and Wealthfront have free tools that will let you play with various goals and savings amounts to see how long it will take you to save what you need. What money apps do you recommend for the younger set?I have a 2-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, who recently started asking me questions about how credit cards work and how much money we earn. Another day, we were in a bookstore and he wanted me to buy four new Dog Man and Captain Underpants books. All of this happened within a couple of weeks, so I took that as a cue. ImageThe simplicity of the PiggyBot app for her 6-year-old son appealed to Ms. Siegel Bernard.CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesThere are a ton of money apps for children and teenagers, but I was hoping to find something to help him focus on developing patience and delaying gratification. Today, bags of groceries magically appear on our doorstep without any visible transaction. If we need something, we can just press a button — as adults, we’re a month removed from any consequences, and children are often completely unaware that there was any exchange at all. Stuff just arrives when you want it.To help acquaint my son with the reality of how all of this works, I decided to pay him an allowance of $5 a week. Instead of putting it in physical “save, spend and give” jars, he’s tracking the same categories on an iPad. I scanned a few different apps, but the simplicity of PiggyBot seemed well suited for younger children. He immediately set a goal to buy two of those books — but he’s going to have to wait nine weeks to get them. (I also told him that we could just go to the library.)Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? I live a pretty low-tech life. We listen to music through Sonos and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device, though we haven’t entirely cut the cord because my husband is a soccer fan. I did recently learn that we can hand in our cable box and pay a little less, while keeping access to cable channels through Roku, though you lose the ability to record.There are also several apps that I use daily or weekly. I always have roughly five dozen tabs open on my computer screen, as well as stories I come across on Twitter that I want to read later. To minimize the clutter, I save everything to the Pocket app, which I’ll read on my commute. I also keep a to-do list on the iPhone “reminders” app.I also love Ink and Postagram for turning my children’s photos into cards for relatives, all from my aging iPhone 6s, which has started to shut down in the cold. I have a long wish list of apps, but I really want more sophisticated tools that would help us become smarter consumers. I want to enter a product name into an app so it can assure me that we’re not feeding our children weed killer in their oatmeal.Image“I live a pretty low-tech life,” Ms. Siegel Bernard said. “We listen to music through Sonos ...CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesImage... and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device.”CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesLots of web writers talk about the so-called FIRE, which stands for “financial independence, retire early.” People are retiring as early as their 30s. What do you think about this movement?We can all learn something from folks like Mr. Money Mustache, who is credited with popularizing the idea of hyper-frugal, anti-consumerist living and saving a significant chunk of your salary so you can either retire early or pursue more rewarding work. But the movement started with a lot of technology workers — and it’s a lot easier to save half your salary when you’re a well-paid software engineer with health insurance and no debt. Sure, these folks had to exercise discipline and restraint. But they had the luxury of exercising that discipline; there are so many people living on much less and struggling to pay for health insurance, rent, child care and student loans or to keep full-time jobs with chronic conditions. It also raises a lot of questions: How do they pay for health care? Will the money really last as long as they need it? A lot of research shows a portfolio may last around 30 years if you withdraw 4 percent of the initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjust that dollar amount for inflation annually. So when you start looking at longer time horizons — or a 50-year or 60-year retirement — it’s increasingly possible to run out of money if you don’t make adjustments.  But it’s easy to see why so many people find the movement intriguing and why it has become such a popular story line. You can’t help but wonder what it took to achieve financial security so early, so you click and hope to learn something. "
5c518c613a125f5075c07144,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/dealbook/us-china-trade-talks.html,"Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks: Still far from a resolutionHigh-level delegates from Beijing and Washington are meeting near the White House today for the first of two days of trade talks, but appear to have a great distance left to bridge.Each government has reason to play nice. Evidence is mounting that reciprocal tariffs are hurting both sides, and global markets have been skittish while awaiting a deal.But there are signs that China is unwilling to bend on key U.S. demands involving intellectual property and technology transfer, even as its lawmakers accelerated a vote on legislation addressing foreign investors’ concerns.A pair of indictments revealed earlier this week against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei could complicate the discussions, as could disagreements over strategy within the Trump administration’s team.Other factors include:Weakness in the Chinese economy. At least 20 companies reported yesterday that their 2018 earnings would fall short of expectations. The Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, Ford Motor’s primary partner in China, warned of a profit slump  of as much as 93 percent last year. China Life Insurance said its net income may have fallen as much as 70 percent. And Chinese exporters suffered a sluggish start to 2019.Slowing Chinese investment abroad. Net purchases of U.S. commercial real estate by Chinese companies — big buyers earlier in the decade — have slipped to their lowest level since 2012.Worries to the west. The motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said that tariffs — along with other shifts in its business — left it barely breaking even in the final quarter of 2018. In the European Union, there are concerns whatever happens: If China and the U.S. reach a deal, Mr. Trump might turn his attention to German cars and French wines. If not, China might dump discounted goods into the European market. “We are next in the queue,” said William De Vijlder, the chief economist at BNP Paribas.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Diverging views on the economyThe Trump administration’s growth forecast is much rosier than those of economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, who warn that growth is slowing and put some of the blame on the government, writes the NYT’s Jim Tankersley.President Trump’s team has predicted that inflation-adjusted growth will average 3 percent through 2024. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Trump’s tax and trade policies were working as expected:“Last year looked just like we thought, so we don’t think, going into our next forecast, that there’s a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things.”An exceptional year: Growth appears to have exceeded 3 percent in 2018, the first time it has done so in a decade. But many economists attribute that to a burst of fiscal stimulus that isn’t expected to be repeated.Growing consensus: The Congressional Budget Office predicted that growth would slow to 2.3 percent this year and then to 1.7 percent in 2020. Economists at the Fed also forecast 2.3 percent growth this year. Some corporate financial executives are bracing for a recession.More Fed news: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has taken a conversational tone in public comments, but the markets didn’t understand. Investors face three outcomes if the Fed is done raising interest rates, and none of them are good.ImageAn Apple store in Beijing.CreditKevin Frayer/Getty ImagesA difficult road for AppleApple reported yesterday that it had flat profit and lower revenue in the fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season. After years of expansion, the tech giant appears to be entering a period of vulnerability, writes the NYT’s Jack Nicas.Diminishing demand: The company has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, but they haven’t had the global impact of the iPhone. That was a drag on the company’s earnings.Slowdown in China: Apple is uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as to potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.Security concerns: Customers said a flaw in the iPhone let people eavesdrop on phone calls. The problem was in the FaceTime app, which Apple promised to fix by the end of the week, but it has been criticized for moving too slowly. A lawyer in Houston sued Apple over the glitch.More Apple news: Shares rallied after the company outlined plans for life beyond the iPhone. And it plans to lower prices on some phones outside U.S. to offset a strong dollar.PG&E bankruptcy: What happens next?Pacific Gas and Electric filed for a corporate reorganization on Tuesday that “is shaping up to be one of the most complicated and difficult in recent years,” writes Ivan Penn.Facing tens of billions of dollars in claims related to 17 major wildfires in California in 2017, with its equipment under investigation in several other blazes last year, PG&E decided to declare bankruptcy despite having a stable income stream and several offers of financing.Now creditors and suppliers of the state’s largest utility will face off against California officials and fire victims to be paid, while renewable energy companies and climate change activists jockey for position. Lawyers, bankers and consultants are likely to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.This is PG&E’s second bankruptcy in less than 20 years; the first came after California tried to deregulate utilities. Dan Reicher, who was an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration, called it “a real mess,” adding:“It comes down to lots of needs: Take care of the fire victims, keep the lights on, ensure progress on climate change and protect ratepayers. That’s at least a partial list.”Revolving doorRoger Lynch will step down as chief executive of Pandora, the company announced, after stockholders approved a $3.5 billion acquisition by SiriusXM.

The United States and China have agreed to a standstill until early March so that they may reach a deal.The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.3 percent as shares of large technology companies like Amazon and Netflix rose sharply.After its shares rose 3.4 percent, Amazon ended the day with a market value of $797 billion, leapfrogging Microsoft to make it the largest company, by market capitalization, in the United States.[Read more about how President Trump sees China’s recent economic weakness as an opportunity.]As the trade war drags on, however, investors have grown worried about its economic impact as well as the risk to corporate profits. Those worries were amplified last week when Apple warned that its sales in the most recent quarter would be worse than expected because of slowing demand for iPhones in China. And the rising cost of imports is also affecting businesses in the United States.[Read more about American factory owners who say the trade war is hurting them.]Offsetting those concerns, on Friday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the Fed would be flexible amid market turbulence and broader concerns about slowing global growth. The comments sent shares in the United States higher, as did strong job numbers for December.Also on Friday, the People’s Bank of China essentially injected $218 billion into the country’s financial system.

5c777b4c49f0eacbf105a932,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/huawei-children-music-video.html,"BEIJING — Executives from the Chinese technology giant Huawei have been out in force recently. In interviews with international broadcasters and at events overseas, they have tried to fend off American officials’ allegations that the company has broken United States laws and can spy on Beijing’s behalf. But back at home, Huawei does not need to work nearly as hard to get help with public relations. Even when it isn’t asking for any.A music video titled “Huawei Is Beautiful” began circulating on Chinese social media this week. Featuring a chorus of children singing and dancing before the Zhuhai Grand Theater in southern China, the young performers extol the company’s products and sing of the pride Huawei has brought to the nation.A Huawei representative said the company had nothing to do with the song or the video, and did not know about it before it was released.The lyrics do not exactly contain hidden depths:Which phone is the most beautiful in the world?Everybody says it is Huawei.The battery is long-lasting, the phone looks good,Chinese microchips are the most precious!The refrain, which is undeniably catchy, goes:Huawei is good, Huawei is beautiful!Huawei gives me wisdom!Teacher tells me to love the motherlandAnd Chinese-made smartphones, love Huawei!During an instrumental break, the children play with what are presumably Huawei handsets and goof around in cute costumes. There is even a rap section, performed by a spirited youngster who says: “Huawei has won glory and splendor for the nation!”The company, whose name means “China’s Achievement,” has expanded its business around the globe to an extent that few Chinese technology companies ever have. Huawei challenges Western powerhouses such as Apple and Nokia for leadership in smartphones and telecommunications equipment. Chinese people sometimes refer to the company as “the pride of the nation.” Still, as the United States has tried to convince the world that Huawei operates under Beijing’s sway, the company has steadfastly emphasized that it is privately owned and has no ties to the government. That has not stopped Chinese officials from speaking out strongly in Huawei’s defense. And it has not dissuaded Chinese web users from rallying around the company in their own ways.The tariff war with the United States has occasioned similar expressions of Chinese pride, though these do not appear to have dampened sales of American products in a large way. Apple’s sales have weakened in China of late, but industry observers say China’s economic slowdown and the iPhone’s hefty price tag have been bigger factors than surging nationalism.In a post on the social platform WeChat, the music video’s musical director, Zhou Dan, writes: “The children’s clear, sweet voices sing out ‘the pride of the nation,’ using the most pure and innocent voices to wish blessings upon Huawei, and to bless all Chinese brands to put on their wings and ‘go into the future, go out into the world.’”The lyrics to “Huawei Is Beautiful” were composed by Li Yourong and Zang Sijia, according to the credits. According to Ms. Zhou, Mr. Li is a songwriter for the People’s Liberation Army who has written several well-known ditties, including a song about Mount Everest that was famously performed by Peng Liyuan, the wife of China’s leader, Xi Jinping.Snarky reaction has abounded on Chinese social media. On the Twitter-like platform Weibo, one user wrote: “If this kind of thing spreads overseas, doesn’t it just push Huawei into the fire?” A face-palm emoji punctuated the sentence.Carolyn Zhang contributed research."
5c80381d49f0eacbf105bb3b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/opinion/trump-antitrust-laws.html,"At his Senate confirmation hearing, Attorney General William Barr signaled an interest in confronting the power of big tech corporations like Facebook and Google. As Mr. Barr put it, a lot “of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.” And since taking office, President Trump has repeatedly attacked America’s biggest technology corporations, especially Amazon, Facebook and Google. Among other accusations, he has charged Amazon with ripping off the Post Office and Google with  censoring conservative users. He recently criticized Facebook, Google and Twitter for “ridiculous” bias in favor of Democrats. By most appearances, Mr. Trump is a foe of big tech.Mr. Barr, however, will find that those “huge behemoths” will continue to dominate, because, in part, the administration’s chief antitrust enforcer is their champion. On top of granting tech platforms huge windfalls in his tax reform law, Mr. Trump appointed a friend of big tech, Makan Delrahim, to lead the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim has consistently promoted the interests of the biggest tech companies.While we believe Mr. Delrahim, a veteran corporate defense lawyer and antitrust official in the George W. Bush administration, was correct on the merits in trying to stop the AT&T/Time Warner merger, that action was an outlier. In a Senate hearing in December, he boasted that he “strengthened” the Justice Department’s amicus brief program as a means of reshaping antitrust law. In its briefs, which represent the views of the federal government as an expert in antitrust law and are influential in court, the department has supported legal interpretations that would make Amazon, Google, Facebook and other dominant firms more powerful. On top of looking into possible procedural improprieties between the president and Mr. Delrahim, Congress should demand an explanation for — and put a stop to — Mr. Delrahim’s under-the-radar effort to revise antitrust law.In the most prominent case, Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide, any day now, whether ordinary Americans can hold tech platforms accountable. The Antitrust Division filed briefs siding with Apple. (Our organization, the Open Markets Institute, filed an amicus brief in support of Pepper.) In its briefs, the Justice Department argued that iPhone users should not be able to sue Apple for monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps. Although the text of federal law grants everyone (consumers, workers and businesses) the right to sue antitrust violators for damages, the Justice Department is seeking to restrict private citizens’ ability to hold corporate power to account. In contrast, a bipartisan coalition of 31 states filed a brief endorsing the right of all consumers to obtain compensation and be made whole.The Justice Department took an even more radically pro-monopolist position in a lower court case. In Viamedia v. Comcast, the Seventh Circuit in Chicago is now deciding whether Comcast, which both operates and competes in the clearinghouse for TV advertisements in Chicago and Detroit, illegally monopolized this clearinghouse when it blocked Viamedia, an ad management company. Through such “refusals to deal,” monopolists can suppress emerging competition or extend their dominance into new markets.The government advised the court to adopt the 2013 ruling by Judge Neil Gorsuch, then on the 10th Circuit, in Novell v. Microsoft, which broadly insulates a monopolist from the charge that it improperly cut off rivals’ access to a good or service they need to compete. Under Novell, if someone sues a monopolist for refusing to deal with competitors, the conduct is illegal only if the monopolist “sacrificed profits” in the process and that its sole effect was to hurt competition. This standard would make stopping “refusals to deal” virtually impossible.The Antitrust Division’s position in Viamedia is especially helpful to Google and Facebook, whose core services are free to users. Consider Facebook’s 2013 decision to cut off users’ friend lists from Vine, a video streaming app launched by Twitter. Thanks to Facebook’s move, users of Vine could not invite friends to join the app. Under the standard endorsed by the Justice Department, Facebook would be protected from legal liability for stifling Vine unless an antitrust enforcer could show that Facebook sacrificed profits in this predatory act. Because Facebook does not charge users, this would be a tall order for the government, excluded rivals and injured consumers.Along with these pro-monopoly briefs, the Antitrust Division’s leadership has publicly expressed almost uncritical admiration for technology giants. Disregarding both congressional intent in enacting the antitrust laws and the latest evidence on the economic and political harms from corporate concentration, our top antimonopoly enforcers have been fawning over monopoly.Mr. Delrahim and his deputies routinely praise the biggest tech companies and adopt their legal rationalizations. In a speech in Mexico City in November, he asserted on the basis of little evidence that “market power is a motivating factor for investment in a free-market economy” and disparaged rules to protect competitive markets as akin to “breaking a man’s leg to make him run faster.” Mr. Delrahim recently hypothesized that “large digital platforms have grown because they provide innovative and disruptive services that consumers seem to like and want to use” and expressed nationalistic pride in the dominant tech platforms being American. Contrary to these claims, however, actions by the European Commission and documents published by Britain’s Parliament indicate that the tech platforms have used abusive practices to maintain and extend their power.In December, Andrew Finch, the Antitrust Division’s principal deputy assistant attorney general, contended that “consumers often benefit from concentration” and dismissed calls to break up or regulate tech platforms as “drastic.”The division dresses up its actions in the rhetoric of humility. In a June 2018 address, Barry Nigro, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division, said that when enforcing antitrust law, “First, we should do no harm,” and warned, “we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward.”Yet, as the Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcers proclaim humility and practice restraint when it comes to monopolies, they do not extend this courtesy to elected officials. Cities and states seeking to structure markets through the democratic process can expect hectoring, not humility, from the department.The Justice Department has, to the benefit of Uber and Lyft, interfered with municipal efforts to improve the lives of ride-hailing drivers. These drivers, on average, earn less than the local minimum wage in many places. In November 2017, the Department of Justice (as well as the Federal Trade Commission) filed a brief against Seattle’s law granting collective bargaining rights to ride-hailing drivers.The Justice Department has also weighed in on the legality and wisdom of state rules on, for example, the practice of law. In a statement of interest in a case challenging a Florida bar’s rule, the Antitrust Division paid tribute to “new competition from mobile platforms that can profoundly change an industry.” This type of free-standing policy lecture voices a hostility to democratic market structuring and is outside the division’s statutory duty to police corporate cartels, mergers and monopolies.When trying to understand the Trump administration’s position on tech monopolists, ignore Mr. Trump’s tweets and look to what his antitrust enforcers do and say. Mr. Trump’s antitrust chief is hindering the ability of federal, state and local governments and the public to tame the power of tech giants. Instead of this deference to corporate power and condescension to our elected representatives, the department should be confronting monopolies in tech and elsewhere and respecting the policy choices of state and local officials.Matthew Buck is a reporter-researcher with the Open Markets Institute.

Top leaders of intelligence agencies made their annual appearance before the Senate to discuss the biggest threats to national security.Cyberthreats from China and Russia were high on the agenda. Among other observations: North Korea is “unlikely to give up” all of its nuclear stockpiles and Iran is not actively trying to make a nuclear bomb — both direct contradictions of President Trump’s foreign policy tenets. Above from left, the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel; and the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats.Also notable was the absence of any rationale for building a wall along the southwestern border, which Mr. Trump has characterized as the country’s most critical security threat._____ImageCreditJoshua Lott for The New York Times2.

Are they surprising to you? Why or why not?Now read the article “How Big Tobacco Hooked Children on Sugary Drinks” and answer the following questions: 1. According to the article, what else do the three advertisements pictured above have in common?2. Researchers say it is important to chart how these companies created and marketed junk food and sugary drinks to youngsters. Why?3. Why do companies want to advertise their products to potential consumers starting at a young age?4. Why were tobacco companies especially good at selling sugary drinks to children?5. In 1963, R.J. Reynolds took over the company that made Hawaiian Punch. What were some of the tactics it used to market this product? Give an example and explain how it specifically appealed to children.6.

What evidence from the article supports your response?Finally, tell us more about what you think: The vaping industry has become the latest subject of scrutiny for youth-directed advertising. In the article “F.D.A. Cracks Down on ‘Juuling’ Among Teenagers” from April 24, 2018, Kate Zernike writes:Recognizing what it called “the troubling reality” that electronic cigarettes have become “wildly popular with kids,” the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced a major crackdown on the vaping industry, particularly on the trendy Juul devices, aimed at curbing sales to young people. …The agency also demanded that Juul Labs turn over company documents about the marketing and research behind its products, including reports on focus groups and toxicology, to determine whether Juul is intentionally appealing to the youth market despite its statements to the contrary and despite knowing its addictive potential. …Schools across the country say they were blindsided by the number of students turning up with Juuls last fall. Nicknamed the iPhone of e-cigarettes, Juuls resemble thumb drives, produce little plume, and smell like fruit or other flavorings, making them so concealable that students can vape in class. Students who would never think to smoke a cigarette post videos of themselves doing tricks with vaping devices on social media. Schools, fearing students are becoming addicted to nicotine, are suspending students as young as middle school for vaping. …Schools and public health advocates contend that the vaping industry is the latest incarnation of Big Tobacco, developing and promoting its products to create new markets for a younger generation. Juul comes in kid-friendly flavors like mango and crème brûlée. The labels on other e-cigarette flavorings resemble popular candy brands like Jolly Rancher and Blow Pops.Take a look at these advertisements and packaging for vaping products:ImageRelated ArticleImageThe vaping industry has come under scrutiny for using candy flavors and colorful packaging to market its products to children.CreditMike Segar/ReutersCompare the advertisements and packaging to those used by the Big Tobacco companies cited in the article:• What similarities and differences do you notice in the products, advertising strategies, messages and intended audience?• Do you think Juul’s advertising campaign is trying to appeal to young people?

5c9dd0db49f0eacbf105fb28,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/lens/finding-fraternity-and-politics-in-algerian-soccer.html,"Arms raised high. Crowds united in song. Riot police armed with batons. These images could have been taken at political rallies or protests. But they weren’t. They were from soccer matches in northwestern Algeria.The sport is so popular in the North African nation and the region, that it’s been given the Marxist treatment: “We call it the opium of the people,” Fethi Sahraoui said. Since 2015, Mr. Sahraoui has photographed roughly 30 games in his hometown, Mascara, and in neighboring Relizane. The result is “Stadiumphilia.”ImagePolicemen standing near the fence that separates the seats of the local supporters from those of the visitors. 2018.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageYoung fans a few moments before the end of a match. 2017.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageUltra members during one of their performances. 2017.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220During soccer season — which runs from late August until the end of May — young men storm stadiums to watch local teams face off in biweekly matches. Unlike those fans, Mr. Sahraoui isn’t concerned with the athletes. He turns his lens toward the surrounding commotion, the fervent faces in the stands.The atmosphere is electric, to say the least. Algerian law prohibits anyone under 18 to enter the stadiums without a guardian, Mr. Sahraoui said. But that doesn’t stop young boys from trying to jump over fences to see the action.On the surface, the takeaway is that Algerians are soccer fanatics. But Mr. Sahraoui sees beyond the entertainment. He says the stadiums have become platforms for young men to find a sense of brotherhood and to escape the pressures of daily life. After spending years among those crowds, he adds, he can’t help but link the energy of those games to current protests.In February, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced that he would run for a fifth term. Algerians had been living under his rule for 20 years, and they had had enough. Thousands of demonstrators have been taking to the streets demanding his resignation, citing problems like corruption and stifling unemployment.ImageA crowd of supporters lining up to enter the stadium for a derby match, a game between two rival teams from the same region. 2018.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageA riot policeman threatening two fans with his baton. 2016.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageSupporters during half-time of a derby match. 2016.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220Life is particularly rough for Algerian youth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the unemployment rate among Algerians between the ages of 15 and 24 is more than 28 percent. And a third of youth are either unemployed or not in school. “We need to admit that what’s happening in Algeria, this popular movement or popular uprising, it’s orchestrated mainly by youth,” Mr. Sahraoui said.He feels that before the protests, young Algerians took out their frustrations in the soccer stadiums. Their songs and chants were highly political and socially conscious: They would imagine better lives or call for local politicians to step down. Some would sing tribute songs to friends who had perished trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr. Sahroui said.Politics has long been intertwined with the sport. In one image, a boy peers out from behind a poster of Zougari Taher, a man who died during the Algerian war for independence from France in the 1950s and ’60s. Locals herald Mr. Taher as a martyr, and the stadium in Relizane is named after him.ImageA young fan who traveled from another town to watch his soccer club play. 2016CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageMembers of the “Verde Corazon” ultras group celebrating their club's win.

A stadium in Relizane is named after him. 2017.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220With the recent protests, Algerians have turned to the streets. “I’m happy for them because it’s a larger space and a lot of people are hearing them and paying attention to them,” Mr. Sahraoui said. The streets also allows for more unity. Women have openly taken part in the demonstrations, while soccer has always been a “manly” sport in the country, Mr. Sahraoui said. He wanted this essay to focus on young fans, and most if not all of those happened to be boys.Mr. Sahraoui couldn’t exactly see himself in those youngsters. Growing up, his family thought the games were dangerous and prohibited him from going. “Working on this project, it was like a delayed exploration of this universe,” he said. “I went there as a photographer, but there was the young child who was inside me.”Fun fact: These images — and all of his personal projects — were taken with smartphones. But he says if no one notices, “it’s a good sign.” He feels at ease with the device. Plus, carrying a larger digital camera would have drawn the curiosity of riot police, while a phone helped him blend in with the crowds.“I think that a photographer will remain a photographer,” he said. “Even with an iPhone.”ImageA supporter asking his fellow fans for what is known as an “exchange,” or back-and-forth chants with supporters of the same team who are usually on the other side of the field. 2018.CreditFethi Sahraoui/Collective 220ImageA ticket seller waiting for clients.

5c2f44443a125f5075c02d39,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/dealbook/us-economy-jobs-report.html,"Good Friday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Were investors right to be worried?Last year, the U.S. economy seemed solid. Skittishness in the stock and bond markets appeared at odds with signs of stability on the ground. But this week’s flow of distressing news, showing ever more evidence of slowing growth, suggests that the markets had cause for concern:• Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China.• Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, although growing, would fall short of the company’s earlier forecast.• The American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released yesterday.And things could get worse, especially amid trade tensions with China, as companies line up to report fourth-quarter results in the next few weeks. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on yesterday:“There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.”More on markets: Forty-six percent of American companies issuing estimates for the fourth-quarter have revised their outlook lower, the most since President Trump’s inauguration. Traders are placing bets on whether the Fed will be forced to change course by a slowing economy and swooning stock market. Investors have piled into money market funds as a shelter from market turmoil. China will keep trying to attract bond investors, and a fresh campaign to promote its currency is expected. If all this news makes you want to flee, that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Coming up: The jobs report and public remarks from the Fed chairmanThe Labor Department will release its official hiring and unemployment figures for December at 8:30 a.m.What to expect: Economists anticipate a gain of about 180,000 jobs, a rise from 155,000 reported in November. Average hourly earnings are expected to tick up 0.3 percent in December from November and 3 percent from a year earlier. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent.What that means for the economy: Economists believe that fears of an imminent recession are overblown. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, a sign of confidence in the hiring outlook.The Fed’s outlook: An indication of the Fed’s views on rates could come this morning at 10:30, when the central bank chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a panel discussion in Atlanta with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.ImageA shopper in Beijing.CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesConsumers’ reticence in China could risk a global domino effectThe world economy has relied for years on the shopping stamina of Chinese consumers. But that spending engine seems to be sputtering.Apple’s surprise announcement this week was just one indicator that Chinese shoppers are pulling back. Amid a tense trade war with the United States, a shaky job market and efforts by Beijing to rein in what one analyst called a decade-long “debt-fueled binge,” Chinese consumers are feeling less than confident. Property sales are down, as are auto and retail sales.The NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson, Li Yuan and Raymond Zhong write:“A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.”The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, met today with the three largest commercial banks in the country and pushed for policies to help bolster the economy, including lower taxes and fees and more financing for small and private companies. Today, China’s central bank said that, by Jan. 25, it will scale back the amount of cash it requires lenders to hold in reserve by one percentage point.As for Apple …The tech giant’s problems are not limited to nervous Chinese consumers, according to the WSJ. Competitors in China, such as Huawei, are moving in on Apple’s smartphone market share. In India, a growth market, Apple is a minor player. Customers in the U.S. are keeping their phones longer.Tom Warren at The Verge had this take:“People are upgrading less, carrier subsidies aren’t enough, and $1,000 phones are making consumers pause and consider. Mix that in with fears of a recession, and 2019 could be challenging for Apple and many others.”The company may pull iPhones from its German stores after Qualcomm took steps yesterday to enforce a court order last month banning the sale of certain versions of the device. The order stems from a ruling that Apple infringed on the chip-maker’s patents involving power-saving technology.Apple’s woes were keenly felt yesterday by its third-largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Tumbling prices for Apple and airline stocks caused more than $4 billion in value to evaporate from Mr. Buffett’s stakes in the companies, according to the FT.ImageBristol-Myers Squibb’s stock price sank on Thursday.CreditRichard Drew/Associated PressBig deal in pharmaceuticals: Bristol-Myers Squibb to buy CelgeneThe companies, both top sellers of cancer drugs with Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo and Celgene’s Revlimid, agreed to a cash-and-stock deal valued at roughly $74 billion. It was one of the largest takeovers in the industry’s history.• The deal values Celgene shares at $102.43 apiece, or a nearly 54 percent premium on the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.• The combined entity will produce nine drugs with annual sales of more than $1 billion each.• The WSJ points out some concerns with the acquisition: Bristol-Myers could take on more than $50 billion in debt. It will have to help Celgene, whose stock slumped nearly 40 percent last year, diversify its pipeline beyond Revlimid.Blame the quants? AQR founder says that’s ‘insane’A number of fund managers say that traders who use quantitative strategies to exploit market signals have made markets more chaotic and unpredictable. But Clifford Asness, the founder of AQR, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund groups, told the FT that investors who blame the recent market turmoil on quant strategies are “insane.”AQR suffered some of the worst losses in its 20-year history in 2018, and Mr. Asness said that critics were only trying to find excuses for their own poor performance. He pointed out that markets had always suffered bouts of turbulence even before quant strategies were introduced, and said there was little hard evidence that they were feeding volatility.Revolving doorSquare hired Amrita Ahuja from Blizzard Entertainment to be its new CFO, replacing Sarah Friar.

5c5de01d3a125f5075c08c85,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/opinion/sunday/20s.html,"My 20s passed away Thursday morning at their home in Brooklyn. It has been confirmed that they expired after a lengthy battle with expectations. At the time of their departure, they had just turned 10 years old.My 20s are best known for creating, producing and distributing panic attacks. Although most episodes of my 20s’ panic attacks were centered on career issues, several of the most attention-grabbing installments were stand-alone: They include such classics as “Casual Sex,” “Could Be Doing More to Save Democracy” and, of course, the annual holiday episode, “Immediate Family.”Audiences famously debated whether my 20s’ panic attacks were dramas or comedies, as most contained both tears and hysterical laughter. Notably, they hit the number needed for syndication — 100 episodes — in a record-breaking three weeks.My 20s were born in a different era: early 2009. Although it may be hard to comprehend in today’s society, when my 20s were in their infancy the iPhone 4 had not yet come out, and most prominent thinkers believed in outdated concepts such as “climate change” and “civil rights.” Cultural touchstones like “Interstellar” were still years away.My 20s moved to New York City after early years spent napping, drinking from bottles and spitting up. They set out to work in emotional investing — an ironic misstep in retrospect, as relationships turned out to be the wrong arena altogether for my 20s. From one failed relationship to another failed relationship, they refused to take a hint, never once making partner.These failures directly led to the production of my 20s’ now iconic series of panic attacks, according to one of several therapists who acted as a consultant. My 20s spent years generating panic attacks until eventually retiring into existential crisis management. In this capacity, my 20s often attempted to remain anonymous.My 20s began a lifelong battle with expectations early — assumptions first appeared in the ego shortly after college graduation. But they fought bravely, and for almost a year in 2015 their expectations disappeared entirely (thanks in part to experimental meditation treatments). Unfortunately, expectations are hereditary, and eventually they returned, this time spreading from the ego to the surrounding id.My 20s were bedridden in their final year as a result of the severe physical and emotional toll of their expectations. But even in their final days, my 20s retained their trademark optimism: The Brooklyn Public Library has confirmed that only a few days before my 20s passed away, they finally registered for a library card. Perhaps this was merely an important symbolic gesture, perhaps another unrealized project — of course, we can never truly know.The final hours of my 20s were spent in the presence of dear platonic friends. At the time of passing, there was singing. One friend described the gathering as “kind of like a celebration.”My 20s are survived by my 30s, who ask for privacy at this time.Ethan Kuperberg, (@ethankuperberg), a writer and filmmaker, has written for the television series ""Transparent.""The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The newlywed couple envisioned their future studios and moved in.They put down bamboo floors, erected walls, built a kitchen and bathroom and raised two daughters in a home they have loved for over four decades.Then a new set of digital locks that rely on a smartphone app arrived.Now, the couple — Mary Beth McKenzie, 72, and Tony Mysak, 93 — find themselves waging a legal battle over access to their home that has raised an analog question: Do renters have the right to an old-school metal key?A lawsuit filed in October in Housing Court in Manhattan by the couple and three other tenants of the West 45th Street building demands that the landlord give them access to all the entryways without having to use a keyless entry system.But it also has opened a wider debate over privacy, ageism and renter’s rights that has inspired new legislation in Albany.At the heart of the dispute is a keyless entry system designed by the company Latch that has been installed in more than 1,000 buildings across the city.Founded in 2013, the New York-based company saw a need for tenants and landlords to share access with guests, such as visiting family members, the electrician or a delivery person.Users download the app, create a profile and can unlock doors via their phone or a key card or by punching in a code on the device’s numeric keypad. In some cases, the mechanism is compatible with an ordinary metal key.Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side and parts of the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood (where Ms. McKenzie and Mr. Mysak live), introduced legislation on Wednesday that would require landlords to provide a “traditional” method of entry in all areas for tenants who prefer not to use a smart access system. It also puts strict limitations on any personal data collected by Latch or any similar digital-access company.“This is probably the wave of the future,” Ms. Rosenthal said. “And so we have to make sure as we gallop toward that brave new world that there are privacy protections and alternatives to using apps. That people who are older or disabled or have other issues are not being inconvenienced.”Michael P. Kozek, a lawyer for the Hell’s Kitchen loft tenants, said residents had been given mechanical keys to entrances where Latch is not installed, including their individual apartment doors and side doors that access stairways. But if they want to enter the lobby that leads to the elevator and mailboxes, residents must use the keyless entry system. The tenants have been given key cards that allow them to access the system without the use of a phone.“As a practical matter, this particular group of tenants happen to be elderly or close to elderly and they’re not really technologically savvy,” Mr. Kozek said.ImageAbout 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City have installed keyless Latch systems that allow tenants to open doors with the press of a smartphone app.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesCharlotte Pfahl, a resident of the West 45th Street building and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said she was not comfortable providing personal information on an app that she believes will also track her movement. She said she thinks the landlord is using it as a tactic to push longtime tenants out to make way for higher rents.“They are trying to get rid of the rest of us,” Ms. Pfahl, 67, said.Latch is not a named party in the lawsuit, and the chief executive and co-founder of the company, Luke Schoenfelder, would not comment on the court challenge.Mr. Schoenfelder said the company did not capture, store or use GPS location data of users, nor did it share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. He said Latch was revising its privacy policy to remove any ambiguity.Landlords can view only the history of entry into common areas, not residents’ apartment units, and they are not permitted to revoke access to the building without an order of eviction, according to Mr. Schoenfelder.“It’s just like going out and changing the locks in the middle of the night — to my knowledge we’ve never had an instance where that was done,” Mr. Schoenfelder said.Benjamin Dulchin, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, a coalition of affordable housing organizations in New York City, said this new frontier in digital access was worrisome.“There’s a lot of reason for concern that high-tech apps actually take and track a lot of your personal information,” Mr. Dulchin said. “I don’t want my landlord to know when me or my kids are coming in or out.“People have an absolute right to expect both security and privacy.”Lisa Gallaudet, an attorney who represents the company that owns the building, said the keyless entry system was installed to increase security after a burglary last year. Ms. Gallaudet said the tenants, who have filed two other lawsuits, are attempting to obstruct the owner from converting the industrial property into legal residences under the state’s Loft Law.“Consistent with their past conduct, these select few litigious tenants are wasting judicial resources that should be afforded to deserving claims,” Ms. Gallaudet said in a statement.Many of the units at the West 45th Street building are under renovation or unoccupied.People who entered the brick building with ease on a recent weekday tended to be of a younger generation.“I’m used to it,” said Luis Solares, 28, who works at a first-floor office in the building. “But not everybody is ready for the digital revolution.”Ms. McKenzie, a painter, admitted she has not stayed current with technology. She spends much of her time at home, depicting models who pose in her studio as life-size images on massive canvases. Two of her self-portraits are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s permanent collection.“I don’t do Twitter or any of that,” she said. “That’s for young people.”But she does not like the notion that perhaps she was resistant to keeping up. She owns an iPhone, but her husband, whose photography business dwindled when the industry went digital, is blind in one eye and struggles to use any type of phone.“We just want a normal key to get in and out like we used to,” Ms. McKenzie said."
5c5a32b23a125f5075c082f2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/technology/apple-stores-angela-ahrendts.html,"Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief hired by Apple five years ago to oversee its stores, said Tuesday that she would leave the company in April.The departure is an unusual move for a top executive at Apple, which is facing retail challenges as sales in China have dropped and iPhone sales have turned sluggish.Ms. Ahrendts, 58, was one of Apple’s most prominent hires when the Silicon Valley company lured her from Burberry with an initial $73 million pay package in 2014. She had spent eight years as Burberry’s chief executive and was credited with expanding it into an international fashion brand.Over five years, Ms. Ahrendts was among Apple’s highest-paid executives, earning more than $170 million, according to securities filings.Apple said in a news release that she was leaving “for new personal and professional pursuits.”One of Ms. Ahrendts’s primary goals was to improve Apple’s online retail operation so it was as admired as its sleek, minimalist stores. She generally succeeded, allowing customers, for example, to order online and pick up items in a store, said Neil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst.Mr. Cybart said that Apple’s stores remained among the most lucrative in the world by square foot, and that traffic to them had been steady.“I don’t necessarily see any huge red flags,” he said while discussing the circumstances of Ms. Ahrendts’s exit.Under Ms. Ahrendts, Apple started offering more public talks, concerts and seminars at its stores in an attempt to draw in customers who weren’t necessarily in the market for a new device.“It’s funny. We actually don’t call them stores anymore,” Ms. Ahrendts said at an Apple event in 2017. “We call them town squares.” She was later criticized for suggesting that a store with $1,000 products could be a community gathering place.Ms. Ahrendts said in a statement that “the last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling of my career.”Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s human resources chief, will take over management of the retail operation in addition to her current duties, the company said. She has worked for Apple for three decades.Ms. O’Brien, 52, is a surprising choice as the new retail chief, given her already heavy load handling human resources for more than 100,000 employees. She will add responsibilities that include “strategy, real estate and development, and operations of Apple’s physical stores, Apple’s online store and contact centers,” according to Apple’s website.Apple was probably willing to give her such a large role to keep retail in the hands of a company veteran, Mr. Cybart said.Apple operates 506 stores on five continents, about a 25 percent increase since Ms. Ahrendts was hired. Mr. Cybart said Apple had recently increased its focus on adding stores in prominent locations in major cities like Chicago and Milan.Two Wedbush Securities analysts, Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe, said in a research note that one of Ms. O’Brien’s focuses would be stimulating demand in China, where the retail experience is important.They said they were encouraged that Apple had chosen Ms. O’Brien over an outside hire, given the company’s recent struggles.“While the timing of this departure is a head scratcher, change could be a good thing for Apple, as the last year has been nothing to write home about,” they wrote."

Britain’s Parliament rejects exiting the E.U. without a deal, U.S. intelligence chiefs contradict their president, and a dramatic escalation in Venezuela raises fear of anarchy. Here’s the latest: ImagePrime Minister Theresa May just ahead of parliamentary votes on Tuesday.CreditReutersBritish Parliament rejects a ‘hard’ BrexitBritish lawmakers, voting on a broad spectrum of amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan, embraced a measure that, in principle, rules out withdrawing from the E.U. without a deal.Parliament also rejected delaying Brexit beyond the March 29 deadline.Surprise move: Hours before the session, Mrs. May raised the stakes by promising to reopen negotiations on the agreement — a 585-page text that was painstakingly crafted over more than two years — with the E.U., which has always ruled that out. The upshot: Mrs. May’s main hope remains that a Parliament that cannot agree on any other course will ultimately come around to a modestly altered version of her deal for fear of a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Critics say she is trying to run down the clock so that Parliament is left with two bad options. ImageStatements by Dan Coats, center, the director of national intelligence, were at odds with remarks made by President Trump on North Korea, Iran and the Islamic State.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesIntelligence chiefs contradict Trump on North Korea and IranNorth Korea is “unlikely to give up” all of its nuclear stockpiles and Iran is not “currently undertaking” the activity needed to make a nuclear bomb, according to a new American intelligence assessment of global threats. Implications: The report challenges two top tenets of President Trump’s foreign policy: that North Korea can be persuaded to abandon its nuclear weapons capability, and that Iran is bent on acquiring such a capability. Meanwhile, a growing chorus of Republicans is denouncing Mr. Trump’s foreign policy as it accelerates away from party orthodoxy. Details: The annual report to Congress also belies Mr. Trump’s insistence that the Islamic State has been defeated. The group “still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria,” and maintains eight branches and a dozen networks around the world, the report says. Another angle: The report concludes that China is now capable of disabling U.S. infrastructure with cyberattacks, and warns that Russia is positioning itself to be able to do the same. ImageAn African sculpture at the Parcours des Mondes tribal art fair in Paris last year.CreditFrancois Guillot/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFrench report on restitution of tribal art has dealers nervousBelgium and France — two of the largest former colonial powers in Africa — are central trading hubs for artworks from sub-Saharan Africa. And dealers are alarmed by a November report commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron of France that recommends French museums permanently return artworks removed from Africa without consent, if their countries of origin ask for them back.Effects: The impact of the report so far is unclear, but dealers are grousing about possible implications for their bottom lines and insisting their trade is moral. They also wonder what the report means for collections like that of the Africa Museum in Belgium, many of whose 120,000 items were acquired during a brutal campaign by Belgian colonial leaders that killed millions of Congolese.One take: Didier Claes, a tribal art trader in Brussels of Congolese ancestry, was critical of the report and said that, as a member of the African diaspora, he appreciated being able to see his heritage in European museums. “I’m so proud to go to an important museum and see my culture next to a Modigliani,” he said.Looking ahead: Mr. Macron has called for an international conference to be held in Paris this year to develop a policy based on exchanges of artifacts. Sharing, rather than restitution, could prove to be the preferred solution for problematic objects.ImageStock numbers for Apple on a screen in Times Square on Tuesday.

Demand for iPhones there has slowed, particularly with the rise of cheaper, local alternatives. The company is also uniquely vulnerable to tariffs against China, where most of its products are assembled, and it has yet to find another product with the global impact of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago.Security bug: Reports surfaced that Apple’s FaceTime app could eavesdrop on people, even if recipients didn’t answer calls.

5c41f6613a125f5075c05263,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/fashion/vetements-demna-gvasalia-paris.html,"PARIS — “Warning!!” the T-shirt read. “What you are about to witness will disturb you. Even shock you. There is a dark side of humanity the censors won’t let you see … but we will.”That’s a Vetements promise. Shock and awe are arrows in the quiver. “View at your own risk” is the T-shirt’s final caution. But Demna Gvasalia, Vetements’ maestro, clearly hopes they look. He hopes they can’t look away.Shock is a gambit. When it works for Vetements, it works well.The label announced itself to the mainstream in a blast of controversial ugliness: thrift-shop style with atelier tailoring and boutique prices. It jangled the nerves of the bourgeoisie, then charged them for the privilege. They — we — paid.Vetements: Fall 201961 PhotosView Slide Show ›ImageRegis Colin Berthelier/NowfashionThe trouble is, shock needs constantly to be sharpened to remain potent. Mr. Gvasalia’s latest collection for Vetements, held Thursday among the giraffe and elephant and zebra figures at the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution in the natural history museum of Paris, had the usual elements but less bite.It took, as its subject, the internet — “and,” Mr. Gvasalia said, “everything the internet does to us.”He and his team dived deep, including, he said, into the recesses of the dark web, where everything from drugs to weapons are for sale.ImageVetements, fall 2019.CreditValerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times(To judge from the model’s accouterments, what he brought back from the abyss was primarily VHS copies of the 1996 teen horror film “Scream.” He made them into clutches.)But it was the web as mind-warp, rather than marketplace, that most impressed him.The internet offers unprecedented opportunity for self-creation, a freedom to do, say or be whatever one wants, all under the mask of anonymity. Hence the masks and hoods that gave the show its hint of menace, one amplified by anarchy symbols and snarls.The anonymous are free to comment, the rabble free to riot. Not for nothing did the show begin to the sound of sirens.ImageVetements, fall 2019.CreditValerio Mezzanotti for The New York TimesBy the end, the hoods had morphed into full, snout-like veils that covered the wearers’ faces; beneath them, the models lit their way by punching at their iPhone screens.The hoods created, literally, a zone of privacy that’s all but impossible in public — Mr. Gvasalia said he’d dreamed of a hood like these for the train rides between Paris, headquarters of Balenciaga, where he is the artistic director, and Zurich, where he lives and works on Vetements — as well as a wry comment on our absorption into our digital worlds.The hoods suggested humans lost in the digital ether, devolved into blinkered, internet-powered machines. It fit the venue, Mr. Gvasalia said: The internet is the latest milestone in the evolutionary chain.That it is, but that observation didn’t do much to move Vetements forward. The show had a cut-and-paste feeling, an online flatness where even the jolts were rote. The faux-cheapie printed T-shirts, the tablecloth florals, the tonic blasts of neon: Vetements has offered them up before.Mr. Gvasalia has made shocking, exciting tweaks to silhouette and form over the last few years; like him or not, he has helped to evolve fashion. But the ultimate evolution of the Vetements ethos as expressed here wasn’t about the dark web or the censors. It was a hooded sweatshirt, printed with the phrase: “It’s My Birthday and All I Got Was This Overpriced Hoodie from Vetements.”"
5c9352f649f0eacbf105e3b1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/style/screen-share-privacy-tips.html,"Whether it’s happened to you or in front of you, many of us are familiar with the screen-share disaster: the accidental exposure of something private (like, say, a friend’s “I’m pooping at work” text) while projecting your screen before a group of colleagues.The only surefire way to avoid this is to do as the lawyers recommend and keep your personal things on your personal devices and your work things on you work computer. Sonia Farber, a partner and founder of Kluk Farber Law, acknowledges that may not be feasible for everyone. “But, to the extent that you can keep some separation of church and state, you should make every effort to do that,” she said.Here’s a checklist of things to do before your next meeting.1. Familiarize yourself with the Do Not Disturb function on your Apple computer*. VideoLike iPhones, Mac computers also have the handy Do Not Disturb function, which mutes your notifications in one fell swoop. If you know you’ll be presenting, it’s a solid option. You can access it in the upper right corner of your screen, but there’s also a convenient shortcut: Start on the far right edge of your mouse pad, quickly swipe left with two fingers, and the Notification Center will appear on the right of your screen. The Do Not Disturb toggle isn’t initially visible, but it’s right above the date.You can also manage your notifications to automatically turn on Do Not Disturb when presenting. Click on the Apple icon on the top left, go to System Preferences, then the Notifications icon. Select Do Not Disturb and check “When mirroring to TVs and projectors.” There you’ll also find all sorts of ways to silence or limit notifications from Messages, Mail, Reminders and many more.*This may be the most useful thing you learn in 2019.2. Oh, you have Windows 10? You can manage notifications, too.ImageHit the Start button (the one with the little Windows icon on it), then go to Settings, then System and finally Notifications & Actions. It’s here where you can turn off your notifications for apps and voice calls, among other alerts.3. Master your company’s preferred online meeting services. VideoMany of these services, like Google Hangouts or Bluejeans, allow you to share one window of your browser, a single app, or one media file, like a photo or video, at a time. In Google Hangouts, pictured above, click on the three dots in the upper right corner. Select Share screen and choose between Entire Screen or Application Window. Choose Application Window for optimal privacy.4. Sign out of your messaging service.VideoWhatever service you use to chat with co-workers, friends and enemies, why not play it safe and sign out when you know you’ll be presenting? Slack has a Do Not Disturb setting. Also ...5. Remember to minimize or close out of all the personal tabs before sharing your entire screen.VideoThe Tabs of the Presenter say so much, so be sure your tabs say the right thing, and not “I fool around all day reading sports news and booking vacations on Kayak and job hunting on LinkedIn.” 6. Maybe just take texts off your computer altogether.VideoThe Messages application can’t be removed from your Mac devices, but it is possible to stop receiving the messages. So, open Messages, then click on Messages in the top left of the tool bar. Open Preferences, toggle from General to Accounts, and then uncheck the boxes next to the accounts (your phone number, your work email, your personal email and so on) from which you do not want to receive messages.You can certainly (and maybe should) just sign out of your personal Apple ID on your work computer (you can do so in that same Accounts section).You can also delete your entire iMessage chat history on your Mac, or if you don’t want to go to that extreme, you can simply prevent your computer from saving your chat history once you’ve closed out of the conversation. To do this, go back to Preferences, under Messages, and this time stay on the General tab. There, un-select “Save history when conversations are closed.”Brian X.

Sign up here.As U.S. negotiates with China, some firms look to MexicoIn Michigan, which is likely to be a battleground state in 2020, EBW Electronics continued to produce lights for the auto industry even as nearby factories succumbed to competition and moved to Mexico.President Trump’s tariffs may change that, executives told the NYT’s Peter S. Goodman. Pat LeBlanc, EBW’s chairman, who voted for Mr. Trump, said the trade war with China could halve the company’s profit for the year. “It’s killing us,” he said. “I just feel so betrayed.”Chinese and American trade negotiators are meeting today in Beijing, hoping to extend a delicate truce. Tariffs as high as 25 percent on Chinese imports have left American companies such as EBW trying to pass higher costs of foreign components to their customers, struggling to keep up with competitors abroad and considering whether to move their plants and jobs outside the country.• Mr. Trump says the U.S. has the stronger negotiating position: China, he said, will capitulate because it’s “not doing very well now.”• He has a point: The Labor Department’s report on the U.S. job market, released on Friday, was surprisingly strong. And concerns about a slowdown in China, whose central bank said last week that it would pour $218 billion into the economy, have riled global markets in the new year. In the past month, China has approved more than $125 billion in new rail projects as a stimulus.• Signs of a slowing economy: But factory orders are struggling not just in China but also in the U.S. The effects of Mr. Trump’s tax overhaul on consumer spending are expected to wane this year. The government shutdown is straining federal agencies. And rising interest rates are weighing on the American housing market.• Key issues for negotiators: The trade talks are likely to focus on issues such as intellectual property, Huawei and energy, according to Bloomberg.• Global markets are watching closely: Equities jumped in Asia today, European stocks opened up and oil prices rose as negotiations began.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________ImageRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.CreditJoshua Roberts/ReutersA.O.C. takes on taxes, Trump and on-camera twirlsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives, spent her first weekend in office trading barbs with a top House Republican over her tax proposal.In an interview with Anderson Cooper on “60 Minutes,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old Democrat from the Bronx, described a plan that would raise the tax rate for the richest Americans to as high as 70 percent. The rate, which would apply to those earning more than $10 million a year, would be significantly higher than the current top rate of 37 percent, which was lowered in 2017 from 39.6 percent. She explained:“That doesn’t mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.”On Twitter, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and the minority whip, called the suggestion an attempt to take “hard-earned money” and “give it to leftist fantasy programs.”Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded by accusing Republicans of “ripping off” American workers “for profit.” Mr. Scalise then said it was “not productive” to engage with her “radical followers,” and admonished her with a hashtag to “#StayClassy.”• In the interview with Mr. Cooper, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called herself a radical and said there was “no question” Mr. Trump is racist.• She also responded on Friday to footage from her college years showing her dancing barefoot on a rooftop, posting another video of herself dancing into her office in Washington. “I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,” she wrote on Twitter. “Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!”Bridgewater escapes the 2018 hedge fund doldrumsLast year was rough for hedge funds.But not for Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater firm, which manages $160 billion in assets. The company’s flagship Pure Alpha hedge fund recorded a gain of 14.6 percent last year, easily beating the broader market and rival funds. It was Pure Alpha’s best performance in five years; in 2017, it returned just 1.2 percent.On average, hedge funds lost 2 percent last year through the end of November. “Macro” funds that bet on the direction of the global economy saw returns slide more than 4 percent.Bridgewater attributed its high return in part to a highly diversified strategy.Other hedge fund superstars had a far less successful 2018.The main fund of David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital lost 34 percent last year, its worst performance since the firm opened in 1996, according to CNBC. Larry Robbins’s Glenview Capital Management suffered a 16 percent decline, in large part because of a hit to the firm’s health care portfolio, the WSJ reported. Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, took an 11 percent hit. The S&P 500 ended the year down 6 percent.A case of nerves: Wall Street lowers forecasts and seeks safe havensThe Wall Street roller coaster is a ride that many analysts now look to with trepidation, as the bull market approaches its 10th year. Analysts from Citigroup, BMO Capital Markets and Credit Suisse are trimming their forecasts for 2019, according to the WSJ, despite soothing words from the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, about flexible rate policy as well as a blockbuster jobs report on Friday.Major indexes are performing far below their highs, especially after a sharp sell-off in December and Apple’s decision on Wednesday to lower its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years.Many  investors are considering safe haven assets like the Japanese yen and gold. Analysts are worried that pessimism could result in slumping equities and rising corporate bond yields, which could lower consumer and business confidence and spending.The U.S. central bank, which steered the economy through the financial crisis and its rebound, has its work cut out: It must handle a slowdown in growth while keeping inflation in check and avoiding a recession.ImageApple iPhone XR modelsCreditNoah Berger/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesApple’s boogeyman: A longtime fan in small-town Ohio?Apple blamed China’s slowing economy and growing trade tensions with Washington when it announced last week that it was lowering its revenue forecast.But the NYT’s Kevin Roose thinks the company should be more worried about his mom, a longtime Apple fan and tech-savvy retiree who lives in a small town in Ohio.The problem? She likes her phone — a three-year-old iPhone 6S — as well as her first-generation Apple Watch and (relatively) ancient MacBook Air. She’s not looking to upgrade anytime soon. He writes:“The most consequential hit to Apple’s bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replaced after roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.”Elsewhere in the orchard:• Apple’s cheapest new model, the iPhone XR, hasn’t done very well, leading the company to cut its production forecast for the device.• As it shifts from its hardware-first approach into a more services-focused strategy, Apple announced a deal with Samsung, its archrival, to offer iTunes movies and television content on the South Korean company’s television sets. Tomorrow, Samsung is expected to report its first drop in quarterly operating profit in two years, because of slower growth in China.Hoping for a slumpA growing number of venture capitalists are rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene.For the past few years, Silicon Valley start-ups have been awash in cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later.Now, some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline. Stocks tumbled late last year, led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple, amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China. And so far this year, the stock market has had wild swings, whipsawed by confusing signals including Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last month.It takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out to the start-up market, but many venture capital investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in recent years would flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year.In the U.S., venture capital activity last year sank to a five-year low of 5,536 deals, though funding surged 30 percent from 2017, to $99.5 billion. In Asia, the number of deals and the amount of financing surged.Revolving doorThe surprise announcement that Susan Zirinsky would replace David Rhodes as CBS News president was the latest major personnel change at CBS after the ouster of Leslie Moonves, the company’s longtime chief executive.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with reaction to the possible peace deal in Afghanistan, U.S. charges against the Chinese company Huawei and an embarrassing iPhone bug.ImageAn American military post in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, last year.CreditJames Mackenzie/ReutersFears of what could follow an Afghan peace dealCurrent and former U.S. diplomats and military officials were cautiously optimistic on Monday about the framework for a deal to end the 17-year war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. But they questioned whether a power-sharing arrangement could be found, and what the effects might be on U.S. counterterrorism priorities.An intelligence assessment from 2017 said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the U.S. within two years. Aides have used the report to try to convince President Trump that a residual American force must remain in the country. Another angle: Afghan officials are worried the U.S. could try to reach a separate deal with the Taliban if that would allow American troops to leave.Voices: They were children when the war started. Now, two Times reporters from Afghanistan reflect on the possibility of peace. U.S. accuses Chinese tech giant of theftThe Justice Department unveiled charges against the telecommunications firm Huawei and its chief financial officer on Monday, outlining a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade sanctions on Iran.American officials said they would request the extradition of the executive, Meng Wanzhou, from Canada before a Wednesday deadline. Huawei said today that it was innocent of the charges, but neither the company nor the Chinese government has easy options for responding or retaliating.Why it matters: Officials have long suspected Huawei of working to advance Beijing’s global ambitions, and they have begun taking steps to curb the company’s international presence.What’s next: Top intelligence officials are to appear in Congress today to discuss the threats posed by Chinese cyberespionage and the role Huawei has played. The indictments on Monday could also complicate U.S.-China trade talks this week.

The panel’s first meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.The lawmakers have until Feb. 15 to reach a compromise over President Trump’s call for $5.7 billion for a wall. The president has said that without an agreement, he would use emergency powers to fund the wall.

Sign up here.You're a busy person, so here's your quick and breezy catch-up on the latest in tech and business news, plus what to know for the week ahead. Your Monday self will be better for it.APRIL 7-13What’s Up? Uber Shows Its HandYour ride is (almost) here, but how much is it worth? Uber’s widely anticipated initial public offering, on track for early May, is said to aim for a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion. That’s significantly lower than the $120 billion that many investors had expected, although it would still be the largest I.P.O. since 2014. Why the falling numbers? For one thing, the ride-sharing company lost $1.8 billion last year, and its growth is slowing. Plus, everyone has been taking note of what happened after the recent I.P.O. of Uber’s smaller rival Lyft. Its shares have already dropped roughly 20 percent below their offering price. A Tabloid for SaleThe National Enquirer, the checkout-line mainstay known for peddling headlines about aliens on the moon and, more recently, aiding President Trump’s 2016 candidacy, is for sale. The tabloid is led by David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s, and there’s word of a surprising potential buyer: the billionaire Ron Burkle, a Democratic donor with ties to former President Bill Clinton. The publication came under scrutiny for helping Mr. Trump’s political rise by buying the rights to a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him and then never publishing it — a tabloid practice known as catch-and-kill. The Enquirer is now under federal investigation for claims that it threatened Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, with “extortion and blackmail” after exposing details about his extramarital affair. Brexit, Meet BrexwaitJust what no one wanted: Six more months of Brexit drama. European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday to extend Britain’s withdrawal deadline — again — this time to Oct. 31. Now, British lawmakers will have more time to argue over their long-overdue departure plan, which they’ve already had three years to discuss. While they haggle, businesses will continue to plan for the worst until Brexit trade policies are settled, compromising the country’s economic growth. On the upside, Britain did not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a deal, which could have wreaked economic havoc. But is the extension just prolonging the inevitable? ImageCreditGiacomo BagnaraAPRIL 14-20What’s Next? What’s in a Tweet?Thursday is the deadline for Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out their differences on Mr. Musk’s Twitter practices. A federal judge in New York has asked both parties to submit a joint letter with clear guidelines about Mr. Musk’s tweets — namely, when Mr. Musk must get approval from a Tesla lawyer before posting. The S.E.C. sought more oversight of Mr. Musk’s communications after he tweeted erroneous information about Tesla more than once, first about taking the company private and later about its production numbers. (Presumably, he will be allowed to keep tweeting about cheese-related flatulence and multicolored squirrels whenever he pleases, as he recently did.) Apple Goes to CourtA jury will get to decide whether Apple owes money to the chip manufacturer Qualcomm, which might sound dull if not for the cast of tech stars involved. Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Steve Mollenkopf, his counterpart at Qualcomm, are both expected to take the stand at the trial, which begins in San Diego this week. Top brass from other technology companies, like the manufacturing giant Foxconn, are also expected to testify. The showdown is a culmination of a two-year global fight between tech giants, with Qualcomm seeking back payment for chips used in iPhones and Apple disputing Qualcomm’s claims to certain technology. Wall Street’s Report CardMore big banks will release their first-quarter earnings this coming week, and the results may be stronger than expected if JPMorgan’s report on Friday was any indication. Analysts had lowered their projections for bank profits in recent months for a mix of reasons, including the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on interest rates. Banks’ performances are often seen as a litmus test for overall economic health, and the latest numbers may offer clues to how much we should be worried about a recession — or whether we’re overly paranoid. What Else?Disney unveiled plans to take on Netflix with its own streaming service, which will cost $7 a month when it becomes available on Nov. 12. In other news, J. Crew is considering a spinoff of its smaller, fast-growing brand Madewell to raise some much-needed cash. Speaking of crunches, Boeing still has no timetable for getting its grounded 737 Max jets back in the air, and the costs of fixing the planes — and convincing regulators, airlines and passengers that they’re safe to fly — are starting to pile up."

Back in Sydney, I told my 85-year-old grandmother I wanted to send him photos of native birds. Weeks later, I received a voice mail message from her, saying, “I took my first photo! It’s a cockatoo for you to send to that boy you like in New York.” It was blurry, and his response wasn’t game-changing, but I’ll always remember that my grandmother learned how to use an iPhone just so she could help me impress a bloke overseas. The ultimate wingwoman. — Hayley NobleImageMy grandmother's blurry picture.City Boy Crashes Through Country GarageI felt like such a city boy when we visited her family farm in Collie, New South Wales. Born and raised in Sydney’s inner city, I had no dust on my boots or dirt under my nails. “You drive a Ute?” her grandfather asked me, referring to a utility vehicle. “Absolutely,” I lied. When I crashed through the back of their garage, I figured we were over. At least it’ll make a good story: “I used to date this girl until her grandfather killed me.” He ran over, unleashing an impressive torrent of curse words. Then I saw her doubled over laughing and knew everything would be OK. — Thomas MitchellImageTogether at her family farm.The Dress I Can’t Throw AwayWhen I was 15, I bought a white dress at a store called “Tree of Life.” I told my best friend that one day I would marry her in it. We laughed, which hurt me, though I couldn’t figure out why. Eventually, I worked it out and told her the truth: None of it had ever been a joke. In the same sentence, she told me she loved me but we could never happen — girls didn’t marry other girls. In 2017, when marriage equality passed in Australia, she was the first person I thought of, my first great love. I’ve kept the white dress. I don’t think I could ever throw it away. — Eleanor GerrardImageThe white dress.I Married a “Yes” ManThe sniffer dog at Sydney Airport detected the forgotten apple buried deep in my husband’s backpack. (Two trips before, my dearest had mistakenly ticked all the “yes” boxes on the immigration card. Tuberculosis: yes. Biological specimens: yes. Firearms: yes. Illicit drugs: yes. “Mate,” sighed the immigration officer. “The fellow before you only spoke German and he got it right.”) I worked my jet-lagged child’s foot into a sneaker, wondering how it came to pass that I am saddled with such a travel partner. Oh yes, it was a proposal — at an airport. I hope we’re always traveling together. — Kate PalmerImageOur airport engagement.Wedding ApocalypseA December wedding planned to a tee. Flowering Eucalyptus gums dripped with pink and orange. Cicadas roared. The menu was Thai, the wine organic, the air so humid my earrings slipped off my lobes. We shot photos by the Hawkesbury River as the storm rolled in, drawing closer with each shutter snap. Guests turned to look, then edged toward the barn. Dark rain on the water, lightning on the bank. “Time to bail,” said our photographer, hopping down the hill. “This is the best apocalypse I’ve ever attended,” said a friend, soaked, pulling the barn door shut with a screech. — Sophie McComasImageThe groom's friend, Ed, closing the  barn door.SEEKING TINY LOVE STORIES FROM INDIAIn occasional special editions of Tiny Love Stories, we plan to showcase voices and perspectives from around the world.

Boeing’s decision-making processes, Venezuela’s opposition at a perilous crossroads and Apple’s impact on the Chinese economy. Here’s the latest: ImageA Boeing employee examining the wiring of a 737 Max jet.CreditDavid Ryder/BloombergBehind the Lion Air crashIn 2010, Airbus announced it would introduce a more fuel-efficient version of its popular A320 jetliner. Within months, Boeing announced plans to upgrade its own 737 jets.In designing the new 737 Max, Boeing tried to avoid a complete overhaul of its systems so that it could persuade  regulators at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that there would be no need for expensive, time-consuming retraining for pilots.That decision appears to have left the crew of the Lion Air jet that crashed in Indonesia in October, killing 189 people, without a full understanding of how to respond when faulty data led the flight control system to repeatedly push down the nose of the plane.How we know: Our journalists interviewed engineers, former Boeing employees, pilots, regulators and congressional aides to understand some of the choices Boeing made as it developed the 737 Max.The central problem: The Max’s enlarged engines had to be mounted differently, which had a destabilizing effect. A new, automatic flight control system was created to counter the possibility of stalls. It’s likely that the Lion Air pilots weren’t told about the new system — or how to handle it in an emergency.ImageJuan Guaidó, leader of Venezuela's opposition movement, with a woman whose cousin was killed by security forces.CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesVenezuela’s opposition is sailing into a stormZooming around Caracas largely unguarded, the 35-year-old lawmaker Juan Guaidó has been working at a relentless pace to topple Venezuela’s authoritarian government — leading street protests and trying to persuade military leaders and other nations to turn on President Nicolás Maduro, as much of the public has done. With remarkable speed, more than 20 countries have recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s interim president. But his success is uncertain. The top military brass has publicly rallied behind Mr. Maduro. Oil sanctions imposed by the U.S. last week will soon further undercut the country’s crumbling economy, and President Trump on Sunday once again described the use of military force against Venezuela as “an option.” Looking ahead: Bracing for the sanctions, Mr. Guaidó and his international allies intend to start pumping humanitarian aid into Venezuela in direct defiance of Mr. Maduro. The opposition sees a make-or-break moment to prove that it can deliver concrete relief, but it could be in for a long standoff.ImageWorkers heading home from the Changshuo electronics factory in Huojiancun, China.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesApple’s slowdown hits Chinese workersChina’s factories, the manufacturers for the world, now meet domestic demand, too. And so they’re more vulnerable to the country’s weakening consumer spending — as reflected in stagnant iPhone sales — and broader economic slowdown, all made worse by the U.S.-China trade war.We looked closely at Huojiancun, an area at the edge of glittering Shanghai where factory workers assemble iPhones. Their dwindling paychecks aren’t just weakening their prospects but also the economic microcosm that had emerged around them, including a bustling night market and food stands.Impact: China’s slowdown reverberates in complicated ways. It could be putting Beijing at a disadvantage in the trade war. But weak spending by Chinese consumers is also affecting major technology companies, whose general pallor makes them unlikely, our reporter writes, to power any new highs on Wall Street. ImageThe autobahn near MunichCreditLukas Barth-Tuttas/EPA, via ShutterstockA national speed limit? VerbotenLast month, a commission appointed by the German government floated the idea of a national speed limit on the autobahn. It not only sank like a stone but nearly caused rioting. The far-right opposition raged against the “stranglehold” of the state, and the transport minister, contradicting his own experts, declared the notion “contrary to every common sense” and shelved it.With few exceptions, there are highway speed limits everywhere. But Germany, birthplace of the car, has a quasi-religious need for unbridled speed.By the numbers: A limit of 120 kilometers an hour, or 75 miles per hour, would significantly reduce carbon emissions, environmental experts say, and at no cost. In 2017, 409 people died on the autobahn, almost half because of inappropriate speeding, according to the German statistics office. But that hasn’t swayed public opinion in a highly regulated society where the autobahn is the one place not rife with rules.  Here’s what else is happeningArms control: Russia suspended its observance of a key nuclear arms control pact on Saturday in response to a similar move by the U.S. a day before. We explain what the treaty is and why it matters.Sweden: Footage of a pregnant black woman being dragged from a train by the police in Stockholm has raised a public outcry over racial profiling.Pope Francis: His trip this week to the United Arab Emirates makes Francis the first pope to visit the Arabian Peninsula. He is looking to improve relations with the Muslim world and bolster the Middle East’s persecuted Christian minority.ImageThe rapper 21 Savage in New Orleans last year.CreditAmy Harris/Invision, via Associated Press21 Savage: U.S. immigration officials took the rapper into custody and accused him of being in the country illegally. The Grammy nominee has long said he is from Atlanta, but officials say he is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who was supposed to leave the U.S. in 2006.  China: Erik Prince, the founder of the security contracting firm formerly known as Blackwater, scrambled to distance himself from a deal announced by another company he owns to build a training camp in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have been detained in indoctrination camps.Brexit: Should Britain leave the E.U. without a deal and riots erupt in the streets, officials have a plan to evacuate Queen Elizabeth II from London, local news outlets reported. Emiliano Sala: The wreckage of the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer striker and his pilot has been found in the English Channel, a shipwreck hunter said.Deutsche Bank: In 2016, the German bank rejected a loan request from Donald Trump, which he had sought for work on his golf property in Scotland, judging that his divisive presidential campaign made him too risky a client.Super Bowl: Advertisers largely played it safe during the broadcast of the U.S. championship football game, emphasizing technology like robots and artificial intelligence, while Maroon 5 performed a halftime show that our critic called “dynamically flat.” The New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, to win their sixth N.F.L. title, tying the record.Smarter Living Tips for a more fulfilling life.ImageCreditAndrew Scrivani for The New York TimesRecipe of the day: This comforting lentil soup can’t get much easier.If you’re marrying soon, here are eight wellness products for your wedding day survival kit.Scientists are studying how your stomach affects your brain.Back Story February is Black History Month in the U.S., and The Times has put together a special presentation of its Overlooked series, featuring 13 prominent black men and women whose deaths were not previously noted in our report.Its editor, Amisha Padnani, described what she discovered through the stories of figures like Scott Joplin, the ragtime master; Gladys Bentley, a gender-bending blues singer; and Major Taylor, the first black world champion in cycling.ImageClockwise from top left: Nina Mae McKinney, Alfred Hair, Oscar Micheaux, Gladys Bentley, Mary Ellen Pleasant, Major Taylor and Philip A.

I don’t want this to sound like a commercial or anything, but I keep coming back to Tumi. I think they make the best carry-ons.” He buys so much, he says, that his wife complains and they give it away to friends or donate it.He tries to take two or three vacations every year with his wife and daughter, frequently to Hawaii. He loves snorkeling so much that he travels with his own gear. “My wife takes the sun and my daughter goes with me, and we are in the water for maybe about four hours without coming out. You can swim there with the turtles. It’s beautiful.”When in Hawaii, he and his family spend their time swimming, visiting active volcanoes and sampling the restaurants.

Huawei struggles to move past growing skepticism, Britain’s Parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit and an island mourns the loss of a lonely duck. Here’s the latest: ImageA Huawei store in Beijing.CreditKevin Frayer/Getty ImagesWhat’s next for Huawei?U.S. officials are poised to formally request that Canada extradite Meng Wanzhou a day after the Justice Department laid out its case against her and Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company she helps lead. Ms. Meng was arrested nearly two months ago at the behest of the U.S. and is under house arrest in Vancouver.Huawei denied the charges, and China’s Foreign Ministry called for the release of Ms. Meng.But the developments could further damage relations between the U.S. and China, leaving Huawei — and Beijing — with very few options for responding or retaliating.The allegations: The indictments say Ms. Meng and Huawei defrauded four large banks — possibly including HSBC — into clearing transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. Prosecutors also claim that the company destroyed evidence, moved potential witnesses back to China and tried to steal a T-Mobile robot named Tappy that is used to test smartphones.What now? Any retaliation by Beijing could scuttle crucial negotiations set to begin today, aimed at warding off a major escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Huawei has shuffled its leadership in Washington to shift its focus from sales to repairing relations with the U.S. government.Impact: Growing skepticism of Huawei is cutting into its business. TPG Telecom, a wireless provider in Australia, halted the construction of a new mobile network that would have used Huawei equipment. And last week, the London-based Vodafone network said it would stop buying Huawei equipment in Europe.ImagePrime Minister Theresa May just ahead of parliamentary votes on Tuesday.CreditReutersParliament rejects a ‘hard’ BrexitBritish lawmakers, voting on a broad spectrum of amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan, embraced for a measure that, in principle, rules out withdrawing from the E.U. without a deal.Parliament also rejected delaying Brexit beyond the March 29 deadline.Surprise move: Hours before the voting session, Mrs. May raised the stakes by promising to reopen negotiations on the agreement — a 585-page text that was painstakingly crafted over more than two years — with the E.U. It was, in effect, a gamble that she could save her plan by asking the bloc for something it has always portrayed as impossible.The upshot: Mrs. May’s main hope remains that a Parliament that cannot agree on any other course will ultimately opt to support a modestly altered version of her deal for fear of a disastrous no deal Brexit. Critics think she is trying to run down the clock to present them with two options: her plan or no deal.ImageJuan Guaidó, who has declared himself the interim president of Venezuela, in Caracas on Sunday.CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesSupport for Venezuelan opposition leader growsThe U.S. State Department said it gave Juan Guaidó, who last week declared himself the interim president of the country, the right to control Venezuelan assets and property in U.S. banks.Why it matters: The move is part of the U.S. campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election has been widely contested. Last week, the U.S. recognized Mr. Guaidó’s leadership and urged other allies to follow suit. Earlier this week, American officials imposed tough sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company to cut off Mr. Maduro’s cash flow.Impasse: Mr. Maduro still has the backing of the country’s generals and has so far refused to heed calls for fresh elections.

5ca39a8949f0eacbf1f8035f,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/02/us/ap-us-sports-betting-falling-short.html,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — When the Patriots won the Super Bowl again — and covered the spread, too — all of New England was delirious, with the possible exception of Rhode Island's tax collectors.The state's sportsbooks lost $2.35 million because, come on, really, who's going to bet against Tom Brady in New England? That, in turn, cut into Rhode Island's tax revenue.For a variety of reasons, not just the Patriots' star quarterback, most of the states that moved quickly to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court cleared the way are still waiting for the expected payoff.Tax revenue has fallen far short of projections in four of the six states where gambling on sporting events started last year, according to an Associated Press analysis.Rhode Island, the only place in New England with legal sports betting, had expected to generate more than $1 million a month for its state budget through its 51% tax on sportsbook proceeds. The actual revenue? About $50,000 a month from the late-November launch through February, which included the Super Bowl.""The Super Bowl did hurt us tremendously,"" said state Rep. William O'Brien, who put $100 on the Patriots and won $100. ""But it made me very happy. I love the New England Patriots.""Gov. Gina Raimondo said the state might have to adjust its budget to account for the missed projections. Still, she is urging patience: ""We knew it was going to be very up and down. That is not at all a surprise.""States began legalizing sports gambling last year after the nation's high court ended Nevada's monopoly on the practice. In a seventh state, New Mexico, two Native American tribal casinos began taking sports bets without specific state authorization.West Virginia is taking in just a quarter of the monthly tax revenue it had projected. Tax revenue is half the estimate in Mississippi and Pennsylvania.The reasons vary by state, from slower-than-expected rollouts and the unavailability in some places of mobile betting, to an all-too-predictable Super Bowl, in which the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3, covering the 2½-point spread.In West Virginia, a contract dispute led to a shutdown at two sportsbooks and the state's only betting app at the beginning of the NCAA basketball tournament, eliminating crucial betting days. The state brought in $862,000 in taxes on sportsbooks from September through the first days of March. With just four months left in its fiscal year, that is well short of the annual projection of $5.5 million.The lower revenue isn't a surprise to state Sen. Michael J. Romano, a Democrat who opposed legalized sports gambling in part because he thought the state's 10% tax on it was too low.Republican state Sen. Craig Blair, a co-author of the legislation, said the revenue to date reflects growing pains. He said he wants to see more mobile options that could generate more betting.""The only thing I'm frustrated with is I would have probably liked to bet March Madness from my iPhone,"" he said.The AP found previously that taxes on sports betting would generate just a fraction of 1% of most states' budgets if they met their estimates. More than 20 states are considering legalization.Mississippi is on track to bring in about half the $5 million that was informally expected for the first year of sports betting. State Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat who opposed legalization for fear it would promote point shaving and other corruption, said it is too early to say whether the revenue will improve or the original projections were way off.Supporters in Pennsylvania are hoping for a boost with the start of online betting, expected this summer.The ability to place bets from a mobile device is a big reason New Jersey met its projections. From July through February, the state was bringing in about $1.8 million per month in taxes on sportsbooks. That's nearly as much as Nevada, which has had legal sports betting for decades and has not seen a drop-off despite the new competition.In Delaware, the only other state to meet projections, the majority of revenue came from a football-betting operation that has been around since 2009.Rhode Island, which missed its numbers by a wider margin than any other state, is hoping the addition of online betting will improve its tax haul. Last week, the governor signed a bill allowing it.Democratic state Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said sports betting is clearly popular, with more than $50 million wagered in Rhode Island during the first three months of operation.___Mulvihill reported from New Jersey.___Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Charlestown, West Virginia; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story.___"
5c63eaa83a125f5075c096de,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/learning/how-do-you-apologize.html,"When was the last time you gave or received an apology?How was the apology delivered? Was it in person? Handwritten? Digital?How sincere or meaningful was the apology? Did it soothe hurt feelings or remedy the situation?In “How We Apologize Now,” Lindsey Weber writes about the growing phenomenon of digital apologies from celebrities:To be famous in 2019 one must possess (in addition to talent, or at least popularity) a patina of authenticity and a willingness to admit wrongdoing. Also: an iPhone.Lady Gaga makes for a perfect case study. On Thursday, she sent an apologetic message to her more than 77 million Twitter followers. The singer wanted to let her Little Monsters know that, after renewed criticism of R. Kelly, she had decided to pull a track she had recorded with him in 2013 from streaming music services. “I’m sorry,” she wrote, her words cast against a grayish faux-paper background familiar to Apple users and celebrity news consumers, “both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner. I love you.”Her statement was written using Notes, a free app that is preloaded onto Apple devices for the purpose of storing personal memories and to-do lists. In recent years, though, it has become the medium of choice for celebrity mass communication.The reasons for writing these Notes vary, but oftentimes they are mea culpas for public errors. Armie Hammer apologized with a Notes app note for criticizing his peers for posting grief selfies after Stan Lee’s death (“I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart and will be working on my Twitter impulse control”). Kendall Jenner apologized for her clothing line’s insensitive use of the Notorious B.I.G.’s and Tupac Shakur’s likenesses (“we are huge fans of their music”). Logan Paul apologized for videotaping a dead body in Japan (“I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention”). Cardi B notably did not apologize for secretly marrying Offset (“at least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock”). Ariana Grande once apologized for licking a doughnut (“I will strive to be better”).Other public figures who have used Notes to make statements include Taylor Swift, Lena Dunham, Drake, Pete Davidson and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Part of the medium’s appeal is the ease with which its contents may be shared. Notes app apologies are screenshotted and dispersed, first on Twitter and Instagram, and then in entertainment news reporting. They are embedded into tabloid websites and quoted by magazines, as polished statements coming directly from publicists might be.The article continues with some advice on what makes a good — and bad — digital apology:The best Notes app statements follow the same guiding principles of any good apology: get in and get out; be direct; don’t try too hard to defend yourself; and (this is a bonus!) maybe say what you’re doing moving forward. “Folks are more likely to give you a second shot if you are just willing to say you made a mistake, and that you are going to do better,” Ms. Rahim said.… Sharing a Notes app apology does have its pitfalls. If fans suspect an apology isn’t as heartfelt or genuine as its straight-from-my-personal-device format implies, the entire thing could backfire. But even worse is a completely unapologetic apology. After the music-retreat-for-one-percenters known as Fyre Festival proved to be a scam, Ja Rule, its co-organizer, made sure to relinquish himself of blame: “I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT.”“You want to avoid the Notes app spiral, long and short,” Ms. Rahim said, referring to the age-old tendency to get defensive, blowing out what should be a simple “sorry” into a long and winding tale of excuses.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:— Have you ever given or received a digital apology? Is a digital one just as good as any other form of apology? Why or why not? (If you never received one, how would you feel if you did?)— What makes a good apology? What’s the best apology you have ever given or received? What happened, and how did you feel afterward? Did the apology help to remedy the situation?— What makes a bad apology? What was the worst apology you have given or received? Why was it so bad?— Which celebrity apology in the article do you think was the best? Which was the worst? Do any of the apologies change how you feel about the celebrities who gave them?— Why are apologies important — for the person who gives them and for the person who receives them? Do you think digital apologies can help strengthen human bonds and relationships, or do they have a corrosive affect? After reading the article, are you more or less likely to give a digital apology in the future?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

He carried a realistic-looking toy gun and a duffel bag as he forced employees to open a cash register and two safes at the back of the T-Mobile store on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 120th Street, according to a criminal complaint filed Sunday.If everything went to plan, the pair had discussed in text messages how they intended to divvy up the spoils.It did not go according to plan.Within minutes, a 42-year-old detective, Brian Simonsen, was shot dead. His boss, Sgt. Matthew Gorman, was shot in the leg in a police fusillade that also wounded the suspect who had entered the store, Christopher Ransom. Officers responding to the scene Tuesday evening fired 42 times in 11 seconds, striking Mr. Ransom eight times.Detective Simonsen, a 19-year veteran of the department, was the city’s first police officer to be killed in the line of duty since July 2017. His funeral is scheduled for Wednesday in Long Island.Mr. Ransom’s alleged accomplice, Jagger Freeman, ran off after hearing the gunfire, the complaint stated.Four days earlier, the two had robbed another T-Mobile store in Queens, about four and a half miles away on Linden Boulevard, according to the criminal complaint.This more complete portrait of the crime that resulted in Detective Simonsen’s death by what the police commissioner has said was an “absolutely tragic case of friendly fire” emerged on Sunday morning in Queens Criminal Court at Mr. Freeman’s arraignment on murder charges.Mr. Freeman, 25, has been charged with numerous criminal counts related to the two robberies, including second-degree murder, robbery, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Mr. Ransom, 27, was charged with many of the same crimes when he was arraigned on Friday from his bed at a hospital in Queens.Mr. Freeman, of Queens, was taken into custody on Saturday at Parsons Boulevard, in a second-floor apartment, following an investigation, according to the police. Later on Saturday, as Mr. Freeman was walked outside the 107th Precinct in Queens in handcuffs, he told reporters, “I didn’t do it.”Lawyers for Mr. Ransom and Mr. Freeman could not be immediately reached for comment.On Tuesday, the two men arrived together outside the T-Mobile store just after 6 p.m., the police said. Mr. Freeman positioned himself outside the shop.Masked, and wearing a dark, hooded sweatshirt, Mr. Ransom, inside the store, brandished the fake gun, and pointed it at the T-Mobile employees, demanding that they empty the register into the duffel bag and give him iPhones, according to a deposition from Detective Vincent Santangelo, of the Queens South homicide squad.Meanwhile, outside, Mr. Freeman “communicated with” Mr. Ransom via cellphone, according to Detective Santangelo’s deposition.Up to that point, the details are similar to the Feb. 8 robbery the pair is now charged with. In that crime, using what appeared to be a long-barreled semiautomatic rifle, Mr. Ransom instructed employees to hand over cash and phones, according to Detective Santangelo’s testimony; he filled his duffel bag with 25 cellphones and about $1,000.[Read more about how cellphone stores have become lucrative targets for thieves.]But things went badly awry on Feb. 12: Detective Simonsen and Sergent Gorman, responding to an emergency call of an armed robbery in progress and dressed in plain clothes, arrived at the store at about 6:12 p.m.Sergeant Gorman and two uniformed officers entered the T-Mobile shop, as other uniformed officers arrived outside, to find Mr. Ransom brandishing what appeared to them to be a handgun, according to James P. O’Neill, the police commissioner. Mr. Ransom advanced on the officers, and they fired as they retreated to the street, Mr. O’Neill has said.As the police arrived, Mr. Freeman began to walk away, according to the court records.When the shots rang out, he ran."
5cb1096549f0eacbf1f83954,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/world/canada/foreign-election-interference-social-media.html,"Unlike the last American presidential election, there was no obvious cybermeddling when Canadians voted in 2015 (nor, for that matter, are there signs of it in Alberta, where I’m writing this week’s newsletter as residents get ready to vote on Tuesday).This week, however, Canada’s digital security and spy agency reiterated its warning that the country won’t be immune from foreign online interference in the federal election this October.ImageGoogle’s Canadian engineering headquarters in Kitchener, Ontario.CreditPeter Power/Reuters[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]Canada’s federal government has been on to this for some time. It recently passed a law regulating foreign election interference through the social media giants Facebook, YouTube (which is owned by Google) and Twitter.But when Karina Gould, the minister for democratic institutions, released the Communications Security Establishment’s report this week, she said she was frustrated by an apparent lack of willingness by those companies to take the issue seriously.“I’m not feeling great about where we are right now,” Ms. Gould said.[Read: Canada, Rebuking Tech Giants, Braces for Possible Election Interference]For a government that has otherwise courted those companies to set up engineering centers, particularly around A.I., it was an extraordinary rebuke. And Ms. Gould doubled down. Given that lack of cooperation, Ms. Gould said that the government is scouring its existing laws to see what it can use to force compliance, and that it is looking around the world for examples of additional laws and regulations to introduce.ImageGreta Bossenmaier, left, the head of Canada’s Communications Security Establishment, speaking at a news conference with Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould.CreditChris Wattie/ReutersHere’s a quick guide as to how other governments are regulating social media or steps they are proposing:• With a sweeping data privacy bill that went into effect almost a year ago, the European Union is widely seen as the world’s leader in regulating social media. It’s also encouraging other countries to match its measures, recently signing a data agreement with Japan. Adam Satariano wrote this definitive overview of how the regulations work.Using the law, regulators in France fined Google 50 million euros this year, in part for not making it clear how it uses people’s data to sell advertising.• After the horrific shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, the Australian government rushed through a bill that would jail executives of social media and impose staggering fines if they fail to quickly remove “abhorrent violent material.” But my colleague Damien Cave, who also writes the Australia Letter, reported that Australia’s haste, with little in the way of consultations about the law, may leave it vulnerable to legal challenges.In light of Australia’s actions, Damien also wrote a superb global overview on dealing with tech monoliths.• On the same day that Ms. Gould spoke in Canada, a parliamentary committee in Britain released proposals for reining in social media companies, something that embattled Prime Minister Theresa May has said is a key priority.• Singapore unveiled draft legislation this month to stop the spread of false information. Critics fear it may be used to stifle opponents of the government.• In India, the government has proposed giving itself sweeping powers to remove internet content. Vindu Goel, one of my colleagues based there, found that many people are drawing comparisons with China’s internet censorship.ImageMark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has called for regulation of social media companies.CreditJosh Edelson/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images• Last year Germany started a crackdown on digital hate speech that was informed by its history, and that goes beyond even the European Union’s strict measures. It further tightened restrictions on data gathering by Facebook in February.• And after long being a laggard on internet privacy and regulation, the United States is now taking interest.Last month Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said that it was time to regulate his company.And make sure you read this provocative column, published in Opinion this week by the longtime tech writer and, more recently, Times columnist Kara Swisher.“Let me be clear — I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now,” she wrote. “But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously.”___This week’s Trans Canada and Around The Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor.Trans Canada—It’s “very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference” in the election this October, according to a report by Canada’s electronic eavesdropping and security agency.—Facebook has banned several far-right groups and figures in Canada, including Faith Goldy, who ran for mayor of Toronto last year.—It’s an inescapable fact of life in Resolute Bay, Nunavut: In spite of the frigid temperatures, the ice is melting.

5c363dc23a125f5075c03948,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/technology/personaltech/china-wechat.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she’s using.You write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?It’s not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that’s the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn’t include the two to three hours I use WeChat’s web version.I’m not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people’s lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.So as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I’ll always be on top of what’s going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren’t so busy.By now, some readers must be screaming, “How about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?” Sadly, it’s just the way of life in China. I’m not trying to make light of the issue. I’ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance. ImageWith government interference a fact of life in China, Ms. Yuan said, she has tried to persuade others to use encrypted messaging apps, but without much success.CreditKenneth Tsang for The New York TimesI’ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven’t had much success. I also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don’t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs. But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That’s where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.How do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?The first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.Because of WeChat’s prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there’s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become “friends.” I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it’s a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.Many businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don’t know how they manage so many contacts.Generally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its “move fast and break things” mantra. Many people in China’s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.Why are mobile wallets so popular in China?When I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn’t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming. Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.ImageMobile payment systems are widely available in China. CreditKenneth Tsang for The New York TimesMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I’ve been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven’t found an occasion to use it. Everybody — hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands — takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment. What are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?The hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it’s “a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment ‘Carpool Karaoke.’”To be honest, I’m too old for the app — Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings — and have not spent much time on it. But I’ve seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users’ viewing history.The short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin’s rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the “Hillbilly Elegy” of China. It’s where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.Outside of work, what tech product are you into right now? I’m a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I don’t use many other electronics. I didn’t own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and it’s the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.My biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese government’s demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness."
5c6474bb3a125f5075c098b3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/technology/apple-insider-trading.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — A former senior lawyer at Apple who oversaw the company’s insider trading policies was himself accused of insider trading by federal prosecutors and securities regulators in complaints made public on Wednesday.The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a suit that Gene Levoff, a former senior director of corporate law and a corporate secretary at Apple, repeatedly traded on inside information from 2011 to 2016.The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff violated insider trading laws three times from 2015 to 2016. On one occasion, Mr. Levoff sold roughly $10 million of Apple stock — nearly his entire holdings — from his personal brokerage account four days before Apple announced quarterly earnings on July 21, 2015.In a related action, federal prosecutors in New Jersey charged Mr. Levoff with one count of securities fraud in a criminal complaint.The company’s stock price fell 4 percent after the earnings report, in which Apple revealed it had fallen short of analysts’ estimates for iPhone sales.Mr. Levoff had already seen a draft of the announcement and avoided about $345,000 in losses by dumping his Apple shares before the official announcement, the S.E.C. said. But since the end of 2016, Apple’s share price has increased 47 percent.Kevin Marino, Mr. Levoff’s lawyer and a principal at the law firm Marino, Tortorella & Boyle, said he was reviewing the allegations against Mr. Levoff and looked forward to defending him.“Gene Levoff was a trusted Apple executive for many years, and has never before been accused of wrongdoing of any kind,” Mr. Marino said in a statement.According to the S.E.C., Mr. Levoff oversaw Apple’s corporate law group of 20 to 30 lawyers and paralegals. He was responsible for Apple’s compliance with securities laws and providing legal advice for the company’s S.E.C. filings and financial reporting. He also served as a corporate officer of every major Apple subsidiary.“As a member of the core group of senior Apple insiders entrusted with material nonpublic information, and as an attorney with a sophisticated understanding of securities and corporate law, Levoff knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he had a duty of trust and confidence to the company and its shareholders,” according to the complaint filed in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.The S.E.C. said he was placed on leave in July and fired in September.“After being contacted by authorities last summer, we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,” an Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said in a statement.In an indication of how senior Mr. Levoff was at the company, he was part of Apple’s disclosure committee — a group that helps Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Luca Maestri, the chief financial officer, determine whether the company is meeting its responsibilities for providing accurate and timely disclosures to investors.At the time of his departure, Mr. Levoff reported to Katherine Adams, Apple’s general counsel. She replaced Bruce Sewell, who served as the company’s top lawyer for eight years until he stepped down in 2017.Mr. Levoff was responsible for ensuring compliance with Apple’s insider trading rules, including sending emails to individuals who were subject to trading restrictions around Apple’s quarterly earnings announcements. Apple’s insider trading policy said any individual with material, nonpublic information about the company was not allowed to trade the stock until 60 hours after that information had been announced.The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff also engaged in insider trading on three other occasions from 2011 to 2012. In each instance, Mr. Levoff received draft news releases and S.E.C. filings. He then bought thousands of shares of Apple stock before the public announcement. Shortly after the stock rose on the positive earnings announcements, Mr. Levoff sold the shares. He made approximately $245,000 in profits on those insider trading transactions.Before those transactions, Mr. Levoff sent emails to company employees alerting them that a blackout period was starting and that they were prohibited from trading Apple securities."
5c48ca0b3a125f5075c05eda,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/technology/personaltech/facebook-online-privacy.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he’s using.You’ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people’s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?I’m not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting on how tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can — which is not very well. Most of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as the advertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.I use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google’s operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I’ve turned off location tracking for almost all of the apps I use, and I’ve tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.For search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I’m doing.Despite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable. (I’m thinking of going back to Firefox.)ImageMr. Confessore has tried to limit the  Google apps he uses. For example, DuckDuckGo has become his go-to alternative for search.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesSo what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I’ve turned off — or “paused” — all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users’ browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I’ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.For all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I’m missing. And that’s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.Have you changed your use of social media after writing about some of the data practices of Facebook? When I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google — and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.That’s partly because I don’t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it’s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don’t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don’t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.The social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it’s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in — once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife’s phone — I’m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.Is deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?Not in the slightest. It may interfere with Facebook’s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do. ImageA telescoping back scratcher in the coffee mug is ""the most important tool of all.""CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesDeleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about “shadow profiles” — dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.What are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter? I don’t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It’s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection. When I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I’ve also used tools at the National Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It’s basically Google for “dark money.” More recently, I’ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you’re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted — often information that is otherwise not public.ImageAmong his apps, LinkedIn has helped Mr. Confessore investigate stories by leading him to former employees who became sources.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.If you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?I’m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it’s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way. The privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I’ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it’s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.I’ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer — and probably more stringent — laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to “opt out” of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?We’re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don’t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don’t actually like.Sonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can’t I just play my songs directly from my phone’s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)Image""Hey, Sonos, why can’t I just play my songs directly from my phone’s Music app?""CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesI’ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter’s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.I have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it’s New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me. We cook a lot but don’t have an Instant Pot. Don’t @ me."
5c2defc83a125f5075c02a92,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/business/dealbook/apple-china-slowdown-markets.html,"Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Apple cuts its forecast, blaming a slowdown in ChinaEvidence continues to mount that China’s economy is slowing faster than expected.The latest data point comes courtesy of Apple. A significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China forced the company to reduce revenue expectations for its most recent quarter. The company said yesterday that it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 29, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.It was the first time Apple had lowered its quarterly forecast in 16 years. The NYT’s Jack Nicas and Keith Bradsher write:“Apple’s surprise announcement added to concerns about the ability of American tech giants to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy and a continuing trade war between the United States and China. China has become Apple’s third-largest market in recent years, driven mostly by iPhone sales.”Apple’s announcement is the latest warning from corporate America about the impact of the trade war, which may be harder to defend now that the collateral damage includes one of the country’s most recognizable brands. Companies like FedEx and Starbucks are already struggling in China. And other American businesses, especially tech players and Detroit automakers, could suffer as well.More: The optimistic narrative about Apple’s iPhone business is falling apart, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Shira Ovide.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Markets prepare for a drop as the bears re-emergeApple’s announcement added to investors’ concerns about slowing global growth and reawakened the stock market’s bears. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures tumbled more than 1 percent overnight.Shares of Apple dropped more than 9 percent in after-hours trading, a loss that was reflected in a wider range of companies. Chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Skyworks and Qorvo were among the hardest hit, down more than 3 percent. The electronics retailer Best Buy slipped 2 percent, and companies with big business in China such as Boeing and Caterpillar fell 2 percent.Markets across Asia fell today, as investors shed technology stocks. European markets opened lower as well.ImageThe Model 3 assembly line at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif.CreditJustin Kaneps for The New York TimesTesla has a record quarter, but price cuts prompt a sell-offApple wasn’t the only company to spook investors yesterday, as Tesla broke records in its fourth quarter but failed to impress the market.Good numbers, but not good enough: The automaker said it delivered 90,700 vehicles in the period, surpassing its earlier high. Of those, 63,150 were Model 3 sedans, a 13 percent improvement on the prior three-month span, but nonetheless below Wall Street’s expectations. The growth rate for the Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market offering, fell short compared with the third quarter, when sales more than doubled amid a rush of initial orders.Demand concerns: Investors were especially perturbed by Tesla’s announcement that it was cutting prices of all models in the U.S. by $2,000 per car. The automaker said it was adjusting to a Jan. 1 reduction of a federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers to $3,750 from $7,500. But what the market saw was a warning that, after a surge of early interest in the Model 3, buyers may be waiting for a more affordable option, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Liam Denning:“This suggests that the vast majority of reservation holders are either waiting overseas, where Tesla says deliveries should start next month, or (and this is probably the bigger group) are waiting for cheaper variants such as the long-promised $35,000 version. That latter group poses a potential threat to Tesla’s profit margins in the quarters ahead, especially as Model 3 production remains below previous targets.”Tesla shares ended trading nearly 7 percent lower.Censorship in China becomes a growing businessThousands of low-wage workers in China are trawling the internet in search of forbidden content in a lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Playing it safe: For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. “It helps cleanse the online environment,” one worker said.Little tolerance: China has built the world’s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party’s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe.Rising influence: China’s vision of a government-supervised internet reverberates in other countries. Even in Western Europe and the United States, traditional bastions of free expression, companies are examining their digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more workers to better monitor their content.ImageThe rocket transporting the Chang’e-4 lunar probe lifting off in China on Dec. 8.CreditAgence France-Presse — Getty ImagesChina’s ‘new chapter’ in lunar explorationChina may have missed the starting gun in the international space race, but said today that it was the first to land a lunar probe on the far side of the moon.The Chang’e-4 vehicle, named after the lunar goddess in Chinese mythology, landed in the moon’s oldest and deepest crater and sent back the first close-up images of a region that perpetually faces away from earth.The China National Space Administration, which hopes to put astronauts in a lunar base by the end of the next decade, called the feat “a new chapter in humanity’s exploration of the moon.” The mission could help advance understanding of the moon’s origins and evolution, and better position China to tap minerals and other resources discovered there.China landed a rover on the moon in 2013, decades after a Soviet Union spacecraft reached the surface in 1959 and the United States successfully sent its Apollo 11 team in 1969. China’s future plans in space involve sending astronauts to Mars and a probe to Jupiter, according to the WSJ.The evolution of human welfare“The world got better last year, and it is going to get even better this year,” Greg Ip writes in the WSJ. Problems like illiteracy, poverty and violent deaths have been dropping worldwide, Ip writes, but the news has received little attention because the decline has been slow and steady.The gradual progress is coming about through basic rules of growth:“Invest more in your human and physical capital, open yourself to markets and trade — that’s right, globalization is good — and incomes will rise.”This has lead to momentous change: Half the world is now middle class.Revolving doorHalliburton named Jeff Miller its chairman after David Lesar retired on Monday following a 25-year career with the company.

5c838f0349f0eacbf105c30b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/travel/hotel-review-the-ramble-hotel-denver.html,"RatesFrom $249The BasicsTo get to the front desk of the 50-room Ramble Hotel, which opened in Denver’s River North Art District (RiNo) last May, guests walk through what amounts to a cocktail jamboree: the first outpost of the bar Death & Co beyond New York City’s East Village. The hotel, owned by Ryan Diggins, 34, a local developer, was generally inspired by the salons of 17th-century France, and, specifically, by Catherine de Vivonne, Marquise de Rambouillet, whose own salon was known as an egalitarian gathering. “I loved what the French salon stood for, as really it was a place for everyone, as long as you had an opinion,” Mr. Diggins said. “Ramble is our shortened version of her name, and also means to wander or explore without a definitive destination.” In hopes of fostering the Marquise’s ideal of interaction and engagement, the hotel stocked the airy, ground-floor lobby with myriad seating areas for lingering, and also holds occasional art programs in its adjacent event space. The LocationThe hotel is close to RiNo’s inventive restaurants (Comal Heritage Food Incubator, where Syrian refugees make the best hummus I’ve tasted, based on their own recipes), shops (like Modern Nomad, a housewares store in a former auto body shop) and food halls (including Zeppelin Station, which opened last March). Our room faced Larimer Street, which was once a hangout for the Beat muse Neal Cassady, and can be rowdy; we listened to bachelorette parties swish by like whirligigs on 16-passenger bike bar tours. The Denver Rescue Mission nearby means revelers may be sobered by denizens down on their luck.ImageThe Ramble has designed its airy lobby to have plenty of spots for guests to linger and talk.CreditJoshua PerezThe RoomDecorated by Avenue Interior Design of Los Angeles, our 300-square-foot standard king guest room — overlooking Denver’s circa 1933 Benjamin Moore factory neon sign — was a victim of latter day design clichés: a sliding barn door to the bathroom, a button-tufted ottoman, a treacly framed compass. The minibar was a bit of a misnomer, as it held 375 milliliter bottles — nearly a pint — of liquor, which seemed excessive for the average traveler and not carry-on approved by the T.S.A.; options included Tito’s vodka ($20) and Basil Hayden’s bourbon ($28). Still, I loved the soft antique Persian rug on the hickory flooring, the Prussian blue walls, the scroll arm chairs in the window-front sitting area, and the Victrola Bluetooth gramophone speaker. There was a French press with fresh grounds from the Denver roaster Middle State Coffee.The BathroomMy inner Dolly Parton appreciated that the 64-square-foot bathroom included a glam station: a Hollywood vanity mirror surrounded by 15 frosted light bulbs. But as someone who is also a nonagenarian on the inside, I must point out that the sleek glass shower enclosure, with brass Waterworks fixtures, left a puddle of water on the porcelain tile floor. There was no bathtub, which I wasn’t missing in this often drought-parched state. The rosemary mint toiletries, custom blended for the hotel, smelled absolutely delicious.The AmenitiesBeyond valet parking and a 200-square-foot cardio room fitted with a Precor elliptical, free weights and two treadmills, there were very few extracurricular amenities at the Ramble. I can only assume that some guests were there to carouse. Wi-Fi is free and fast, and you can stream your Netflix and other accounts to the TV. The hotel recently installed iPads in every room for communicating with staff, which was wise — the rooms don’t have phones, and my own iPhone had no service in the room.ImageThe Ramble Hotel opened in Denver last May, with an outpost of Death & Co in the lobbyCreditJoshua PerezDiningAfter I booked the room, a confirmation email from the hotel urged me to make a reservation at Death & Co posthaste. The scene-y herringbone-floored, chandelier-lit lobby bar warranted the precaution. I ordered the Mondrian cocktail — with blanco tequila, raspberry, aperitivo, egg white and sparkling wine — which tasted like a melted Popsicle, and, given the late afternoon hour and my near heat exhaustion, I actually liked. We had dinner at Super Mega Bien, the on-site Latin American dim sum restaurant by Dana Rodriguez, a James Beard Award-nominated chef. Exquisite dishes included chipotle honey-roasted duck served with stout housemade flour gorditas and goat cheese stuffed fried squash blossoms. The Bottom LineAlthough families with children might want to book elsewhere, the Ramble Hotel is a perfect den for those hoping to experience a sliver of Denver’s 19th-century reputation as the party-opolis of the Wild West.The Ramble Hotel, 1280 25th Street; 720-996-6300; theramblehotel.comFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’re following today’s announcement that the U.S. is suspending a Reagan-era arms treaty with Russia, as well as the monthly jobs report.  We’re also looking ahead to the Super Bowl on Sunday. ImagePresident Trump spoke to The Times in the Oval Office on Thursday. “I love this job,” he said.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesPresident calls wall talks “a waste of time”President Trump said on Thursday that he had all but given up negotiating with Congress to fund a wall on the southwestern border, suggesting that he planned to declare a national emergency to build it instead.Mr. Trump made the remarks in an interview with The Times, during which he also dismissed the investigations that have dogged his presidency, expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with China and denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs.Here are five takeaways from the interview, and excerpts from the conversation.Fact check: We assessed the president’s statements about trade, the military and the flow of drugs at the border with Mexico.Background: The interview was arranged after Mr. Trump invited A. G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, to an off-the-record dinner. Mr. Sulzberger declined, saying he would prefer an on-the-record interview that included two Times reporters. The Daily: Today’s episode is about a discussion of the media during Thursday’s interview.U.S. suspends arms control treaty with RussiaSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the suspension of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty this morning, based on the long-running accusation that Moscow is violating its terms. Russia has likewise accused the U.S. of breaking the accord. American officials expect a full withdrawal from the treaty after six months. Starting on Saturday, the U.S. would be free to begin testing or deploying its own weapons.Background: The I.N.F. was long considered a model arms control treaty, banning an entire category of weapons deployed in the 1980s. But China was not a signatory, and the treaty’s terms prevented the U.S. from countering its growing nuclear arsenal.ImageThis week has brought record-breaking snowfall to Buffalo.CreditLindsay Dedario/ReutersPolar vortex moves eastBitter temperatures are expected to loosen their grip on the Midwest today, as the dangerously cold weather system that has disrupted life in the region heads toward the East Coast. On Thursday, a temperature of minus 38 was recorded in Illinois. If confirmed, it would be a record low for the state.Notable: At least 21 deaths have been attributed to the cold, including that of a student at the University of Iowa who was found unconscious outside a campus building.The year the N.F.L. bounced backThe Super Bowl on Sunday between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots follows a season in which the league’s TV ratings rebounded after dropping the previous two years.Plenty of dangers remain — including a concussion crisis and dwindling attendance —  but new stars and fewer off-the-field controversies have helped the N.F.L. renew its popularity.The details: The game starts at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday. Our writer picks the Rams to win, but it’s hard to bet against Tom Brady, the Patriots quarterback, who’ll be starting his ninth Super Bowl. You can follow our live coverage of the Super Bowl here.Another angle: The Rams’ Sean McVay, 33, is the youngest head coach in Super Bowl history. The rest of the league has rushed to replicate his success.If you have 16 minutes, this is worth itLorena Bobbitt, in a new light ImageCreditHeather Sten for The New York TimesShe’s been a punch line for most of her adult life, after she cut off her husband’s penis 26 years ago. But few asked what made her do it. Lorena Gallo, as she is now known, talked to our reporter about the rest of the story, one of a young immigrant who snapped after enduring years of domestic violence. Here’s what else is happeningA strong jobs report: The U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported today. Analysts had been uncertain about the effects of the monthlong partial government shutdown and had expected a gain of only 172,000 jobs.The 2020 election: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced today that he is running for president, joining the increasingly crowded Democratic field. A bipartisan rebuke: The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to advance legislation drafted by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to express strong opposition to President Trump’s withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria and Afghanistan. Fix for iPhones: Apple said on Friday that it would release a software update next week to repair a security flaw that allowed one iPhone user to eavesdrop on another through the FaceTime app. Apple-Facebook dispute: Apple restored access to its internal apps for Facebook’s 35,000 workers on Thursday, after cutting it off for two days over a violation of Apple’s rules. The spat underscored the tensions between two tech giants. Clarity on Trump Tower calls: Phone calls that Donald Trump Jr. received from a blocked number around the time of a 2016 meeting with Russians were from family friends, not his father, according to evidence obtained by Senate investigators. There have long been questions about whether President Trump knew about the meeting.India’s economy: Months before a general election, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was accused on Thursday of suppressing an official report said to show the unemployment rate at a 45-year high. Mr. Modi’s popularity has rested in part on his promises to make India an economic powerhouse.

Its fruits are known today as the concept of Proto-Indo-European, a mother language for dozens of tongues. The idea revolutionized not only the study of language, but also the sense of human history.The man who delivered the talk, Sir William Jones, was, predictably, a student of languages and culture. Less predictably, he was in India because he was also a legal expert — the same reason he ultimately became convinced of his theory.ImageSir William Jones, circa 1770.CreditHulton Archive, via Getty ImagesHe arrived many decades before the Raj, or British government rule. The British East India Company was increasing its control over territories where it had long traded. Some of the company’s officials wanted British justices like Jones to supervise the administration of Indian courts; translations from Sanskrit to English were crucial to that effort.Jones’s work with translators enabled his remarkable insights.That’s it for this briefing.

Sign up here.Here’s your checklist of everything to know in business and tech for the coming week, so you can feel up-to-date and well-rounded even if all you want to talk about is Meghan Markle’s baby. (Any day now!) Enjoy the rest of your weekend.MARCH 24-30 What’s Up? Follow the MoneyEight members of the Sackler family, owners of the pharmaceutical company that makes the potent (and highly addictive) opioid OxyContin, have been sued for fraud by New York State. They are accused of hiding profits and siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from their company, Purdue Pharma, into personal offshore accounts while the business was under investigation for its role in stoking the opioid epidemic. Since OxyContin came on the market in 1996, more than 200,000 people in the United States have died from overdoses involving prescription opioids, and the Sacklers have become one of the country’s wealthiest families. Unicorn StampedeIf you take a Lyft this week, pay attention — does it feel any different to use the world’s first publicly traded ride-hailing platform? Perhaps not, but at least you’re both going places. The company made its market debut on Friday, hitting the Nasdaq with much fanfare at $72 a share. It finished its first day of trading at $78.29 (putting its value at more than $26.4 billion), and its Silicon Valley brethren will be closely watching its progress. A wave of other big tech start-ups — known as “unicorns” once they cross the threshold of a $1 billion dollar valuation, although these are now technically “decacorns” — plan to follow in Lyft’s footsteps later this year, including Uber (Lyft’s bigger competitor), Slack, Pinterest and Postmates. Apple Branches OutApple is turning over a new leaf — or several. The tech company plans this fall to start streaming original programming and shows from partnering networks on an app called Apple TV Plus, intended to rival Netflix and HBO. It’s also rolling out a news service that charges users $10 a month to access over 300 different publications, some of which charge subscription fees otherwise. Plus, it’s introducing more games. And — why not? — a credit card with Goldman Sachs. It’s all part of a larger plan to diversify beyond hardware products like iPhones, which haven’t been bringing in as much revenue lately. ImageCreditGiacomo BagnaraMARCH 31-APRIL 6What’s Next? From Bad to WorseWhat’s to become of Brexit? As its original deadline of March 29 came and went, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is a bigger mess than ever. The British Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-ditch effort to pass her plan on Friday, even when she played her final bargaining chip — her own seat, which she offered to give up if opposing lawmakers would agree to the deal. That wasn’t enough. Now, Britain is lurching toward a potential “no-deal” Brexit on April 12. That could have catastrophic consequences for its economy and send shock waves through Europe and beyond. Flight FixesLook out for more definitive news about what may have caused the two deadly Boeing 737 Max plane crashes, and what Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority plan to do about it. Investigators reached a preliminary conclusion on Thursday that a glitchy system kicked in right before the Ethiopian Airlines flight went down earlier this month. Boeing has proposed updating the software and making other changes to the planes, which have been grounded for more than two weeks. The fixes would give pilots more control over the flight system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data. Boeing didn’t provide a timeline for carrying out the fixes, since it needs the F.A.A. — also under intense scrutiny over its certification of the jet — to give its blessing first. What’s Mine Is MineIf you’re sick of the trade war between the United States and China, imagine how the negotiators on both sides feel at this point. Chinese officials will fly back to Washington this week to continue talks, just days after American representatives visited Beijing. But the needle is moving on one major sticking point: intellectual property. American companies have complained of pressure to share their proprietary technology as a condition of working with Chinese business partners, only to see that technology adopted by Chinese competitors. As part of a trade deal, the United States wants to put a lid on this practice, and officials say that progress is finally being made. What Else?Facebook has been accused of causing housing discrimination by allowing advertisers to target ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. Separately, the platform announced a ban on all white nationalist content after a New Zealand gunman used social media to post live video of his attacks on two mosques.

5c627d5e3a125f5075c09337,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/business/dealbook/stock-market-earnings-recession.html,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Fears of a looming United States recession have subsided, with investors taking comfort that the Federal Reserve will continue to support economic growth.But warning signs keep flashing about the shaky fundamentals of the economy and therefore the stock market. The latest alarm bell is that Wall Street analysts are slicing their forecasts for how much big companies will earn in the months ahead.Halfway through the first quarter of the year, analysts now expect profits of companies in the S&P 500 to decline by 1.7 percent from the same period last year, according to data from John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.That is a sharp reversal from the start of 2019, when the same analysts predicted that corporate earnings would rise by 3.3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2018. And in October, before the stock markets entered a downward spiral at the end of the year, analysts had anticipated that first-quarter earnings would leap by 6.6 percent.Corporate profits are by no means a perfect proxy for the health of the United States economy, the world’s largest. But they exert heavy influence over the direction of the stock markets.In the first nine months of last year, for example, an unexpected gusher of company earnings — up 20 percent from their previous levels — powered the S&P 500 to record highs. The fat bottom lines allowed investors to look past both the prospect of a trade war between the United States and China and a number of data points that showed large foreign economies, including Japan and Germany, losing steam.Even in the final three months of 2018, as the United States appeared to be skidding into an economic recession, corporate profits leapt higher. Not all companies have disclosed their fourth-quarter results yet, but they are on track to be up 13.3 percent from 2017.It isn’t unusual for analysts to pare back their earnings forecasts over the course of a quarter. Corporate executives offer guidance about how their businesses are performing, and a variety of macroeconomic data helps analysts hone their profit projections. Over the past decade, analysts’ profit forecasts have declined on average by 3.7 percent over the course of a full quarter.On Dec. 31, analysts expected companies in the S&P 500 to earn, on average, $40.21 per share. Today, that estimate is $37.95 — an unusually large 5.6 percent drop, according to FactSet.If companies’ first-quarter performances turn out to be as weak as analysts expect, the United States will be on track for what the financial community calls an earnings recession, which occurs when corporate profits shrink for two straight quarters.That looks increasingly likely to happen in the first half of this year. Analysts expect earnings to rise by just 1.2 percent in the second quarter. That forecast is likely to fall, perhaps into negative territory, as more companies disclose their results and analysts update their forecasting models.The S&P 500 last endured an earnings recession in 2015 and 2016. It was set off in large part by tumbling oil prices, which eroded the profits of energy companies. During that period, a six-year stock market rally stalled, and the S&P 500 twice fell by more than 10 percent.Corporate profits this year were always going to face a difficult comparison with 2018. The combination of a strong United States economy and the newly reduced corporate tax rates led earnings to jump more than 20 percent.But profits are now under pressure on multiple fronts, and there are no new tax cuts to cushion the blow — an ill omen for the stock market, if not the broader economy. Rising costs and a slowing global economy, in particular in China, have caused many S&P 500 companies to reduce their profit outlooks for 2019.That is especially true among technology companies. Analysts expect them to report a nearly 10 percent decline in profits in the first quarter, the biggest decline of any sector in the S&P 500.Much of the blame for the tech sector’s declining fortunes rests with Apple. The company warned in early January that it was seeing diminished demand for new iPhones in China. When it reported earnings, Apple said it expected sales of $55 billion to $59 billion in the current quarter, below analysts’ expectations for $59 billion.Since the end of last year, analysts have cut by nearly 19 percent their estimates for how much Apple will earn in the first three months of the year."
5c3937653a125f5075c04061,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/nyregion/victor-casado-zarrab-bribe.html,"Reza Zarrab was a well-connected Turkish-Iranian gold trader known for throwing money around with abandon, paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Turkish officials.When he was arrested in 2016 and jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, an ultrasecure federal lockup in Manhattan, one of the guards, Victor Casado, 36, of the Bronx, saw an opportunity and offered his services.Over a year, he smuggling in alcohol, cellphones and vitamin C packets, among other things, for Mr. Zarrab in exchange for at least $50,000 in bribes, the authorities said.Mr. Casado was eventually arrested and pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges last summer. On Friday, Mr. Casado, a former New York City police officer who was forced to resign after he committed perjury in court, stood before a federal judge and was sentenced to three years in prison and three years supervised release.“This crime is really an assault against an institution — really, our entire system of justice,” the judge, Richard J. Sullivan, said. Mr. Casado’s actions, he said, cast a shadow on the federal justice system. “There’s a presumption among people that the federal courts are incorruptible,” Judge Sullivan said. “You can’t bribe your way through your time at the M.C.C.”Prosecutors said Mr. Casado was paid off by Mr. Zarrab’s associates, including, on one occasion, a female Turkish lawyer with whom the guard communicated through the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp. The government has not named the attorney.Before he was sentenced, Mr. Casado expressed remorse for his actions and asked for leniency. “This is not who I grew up planning to be,” he said. “I don’t have a worthy excuse for my actions. I wish I could go back in time and make different decisions.”ImageReza Zarrab, seen here in 2013, was jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center when Mr. Casado offered his services.CreditDepo Photos, via Associated PressMr. Zarrab, whose prosecution drew sharp criticism from Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against Iran and is cooperating with American authorities. Although Mr. Zarrab is in federal custody, he has not been sentenced.Mr. Casado’s attorney, Florian Miedel, outlined in court papers the damage Mr. Casado had already done to his life. To pay his legal bills and the court-ordered forfeiture, Mr. Casado sold his Bronx condominium and currently sleeps “on a mattress on the living room floor of his mother’s one-bedroom apartment.”On Friday, several of Mr. Casado’s friends and family attended the hearing in the ninth-floor courtroom. During the proceedings, his fiancée blinked back tears, while other supporters of Mr. Casado looked on solemnly.Mr. Casado agreed as part of his plea to forfeit $26,500, the amount in bribes that the government was able to document.Mr. Casado’s lawyers submitted letters vouching for his character and outlining the struggles he faced while growing up in the crime-ridden Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, and his work as a youth counselor for the Board of Education.But federal prosecutors introduced an unusually detailed account of the end of his career as a police officer, noting he was investigated by the Internal Affairs Bureau and found to have lied under oath before a grand jury. He resigned, prosecutors wrote, “in lieu of being indicted.”The police confirmed that Mr. Casado joined the force in January 2007, and resigned in May 2008.The bribery case involving Mr. Casado and Mr. Zarrab is not isolated. In August, another guard at the jail, Dario Quirumbay, was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors with smuggling two iPhones and alcohol to inmates in exchange for about $1,200 in bribes. Mr. Quirumbay’s case is still pending.Mr. Casado was ordered to surrender to a federal corrections facility on Feb. 26. In court, he asked to be incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn., in order to be close to his young son."
5c4c2fbe3a125f5075c06741,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/andrew-owen-renner-alaska.html,"When a father-and-son hunting pair from Alaska poached a black bear mother and her two newborn cubs in their den last year, they initially seemed to get away with it.There was little chance for witnesses on a remote island off Alaska’s southern coast. The hunters traveled there by boat, strapping on backcountry skis to reach the bear den. But a motion-activated camera, being used for wildlife research, captured the hunters’ actions on the island, the authorities said.This week, after pleading guilty to various poaching charges, the father, Andrew Renner, a 41-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was sentenced to three months in jail and barred from hunting for a decade, said Aaron Peterson, the state’s assistant attorney general, who prosecuted the case. His son Owen Renner, 18, received a 30-day suspended sentence and was required to perform community service.Based on state law, killing a mother bear or bear cubs is a crime. But Mr. Peterson said that defendants in poaching cases rarely get jail time. That’s because hunters often argue that they poached an animal by mistake and typically have no criminal record, he said.In the case of the Renners, however, Mr. Peterson said in a phone interview, he felt the crime was so egregious that he asked for jail time.“What they did in this case was shoot two newborn bear cubs who couldn’t escape,” he said. “They had no way of getting out of that den. They were completely at the mercy of the Renners.”Based on the camera footage, which was summarized by prosecutors in a news release, Andrew Renner and his son approached the den on Esther Island, in Prince William Sound, on April 14. Owen Renner fatally shot the sleeping mother bear with a rifle, prosecutors said, causing the cubs to start shrieking inside the den.Andrew Renner then fatally shot the cubs.Prosecutors said the recovered video footage showed the Renners butchering the mother bear and taking the remains away in bags. Two days later, the camera caught them returning to the area to collect the bullet shells and dispose of the bear cubs’ bodies, according to a report from Alaska’s Department of Public Safety.Andrew Renner’s lawyer declined to comment. His son’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.Because the mother bear was being studied by the United States Forest Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, she wore a GPS-enabled collar. About two weeks after the Renners shot the bear family, Andrew Renner took that collar and the mother bear’s skin to an Alaska Department of Fish and Game site, claiming that he had mistakenly shot her and did not realize she was a mother until he noticed she had teats, the Department of Public Safety report said. He also claimed that there were no cubs in the den.It was not until August that the Renners were charged with poaching, according to the report.Charlotte Westing, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who runs the black bear study, said the cameras were installed to keep researchers apprised of whether the bears have cubs.According to a report on the black bear study published this month, the researchers have placed collars on about four dozen black bears on two islands in Prince William Sound. The collar logs geographical positioning every five hours, providing a detailed map of the area that the bears traverse.By chance, a camera captured a crime that is often not brought to light because the forest provides cover. “What happens in the woods is often just between the person and their actions,” Ms. Westing said.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game allows hunting of bears and bear cubs that are hibernating in their dens on limited state and federal lands where it is deemed a “customary and traditional practice.” That tactic has been long opposed by many conservationists and animal rights activists.Both the father and the son pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges related to the poaching, Mr. Peterson said. Andrew Renner also pleaded guilty to falsifying documentation related to the bear killings.In addition to setting the three-month jail sentence, an Alaska District Court judge fined Andrew Renner $9,000 and ordered that he must forfeit his boat, pickup truck, guns, iPhones and skis, prosecutors said. Owen Renner’s hunting license will be suspended for two years."
5c967b8c49f0eacbf105eafb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/opinion/sunday/homeless-chess-champion-tani.html,"Tanitoluwa Adewumi, age 8, skidded around the empty apartment, laughing excitedly, then leapt onto his dad’s back. “I have a home!” he said in wonderment. “I have a home!”A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.Now the story gets even better.After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing — in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani.[Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]The family settled on one of the more modest and practical housing offers: An anonymous donor paid a year’s rent on a two-bedroom apartment near Tani’s current school. The apartment is clean, comfortable and freshly painted, without being luxurious, and the Adewumis gaze adoringly at their new kitchen.ImageThe Adewumi family: Tani and his brother, Austin, and their parents, Kayode and Oluwatoyin.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York Times“I want my mom’s cooking again!” Tani mused as he explored the apartment. It was bare, but another donor had offered furniture, sheets and towels. Someone else was sending 100 chess books.Heartfelt thanks to all my readers for this generosity: I truly have the best readers.And now the story gets even better.The Adewumis have decided that they will not spend a cent of the $200,000 GoFundMe money on themselves. They will take out a 10 percent tithe and donate it to their church, which helped them while they were homeless, and the rest will be channeled through a new Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation to help African immigrants who are struggling in the United States the way they were a week ago.“Anybody who is coming from Africa who is in the position we were in, we will help them,” Mr. Adewumi said, acknowledging that details need to be worked out.I asked them how they could turn down every penny of such a huge sum. Didn’t they want a celebration dinner? New iPhones? A vacation?“I’m a hardworking guy,” Mr. Adewumi explained. He has two jobs: He drives for Uber with a rented car and sells real estate through Brick & Mortar. Someone has now offered him a free car so that he can keep more of the money he makes driving, and Tani’s mom was just offered a job as a health care aide at a hospital.I asked Tani if he was O.K. with seeing the $200,000 disappear. He shrugged. “I want to help other kids,” he said. “I don’t mind.”ImageCreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesSurely, I pressed him, there was some material object he coveted. There was a long silence. “Maybe a computer,” he acknowledged.The family was tempted by the offers of full scholarships at top private schools. But Tani and his parents decided that while he might accept such a scholarship for middle school, he would be loyal and stick with the public elementary school, P.S. 116, that taught him chess and waived his fees for the chess club.“This school showed confidence in Tanitoluwa,” his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, told the P.S. 116 principal, Jane Hsu. “So we return the confidence.” And then, overcome with emotion, the mom and the principal hugged.There’s a risk that a triumph like this leaves the impression that charity is the solution rather than a way to fill gaps: Fundamentally we need comprehensive systems in place to support needy kids. We would never build a bridge or subway with volunteers and donations, so why entrust an even more urgent cause — homeless children — to charity?Tani thrived because everything fell into place: a good school, a dedicated chess teacher and devoted parents committed to taking their son to every chess practice. The challenge is to replicate that supportive environment for all the other Tanis out there with public services and private philanthropy alike.One challenge I face is that readers often want to donate just to a particular individual I write about, without addressing the larger social problem. So it’s thrilling to see Tani and his parents use their good fortune to help other anonymous kids in need. In that, there’s a lesson for all of us.“God has already blessed me,” Mr. Adewumi told me. “I want to release my blessing to others.”READ NICHOLAS KRISTOF’S FIRST STORY ABOUT TANIOpinion | Nicholas KristofThis 8-Year-Old Chess Champion Will Make You SmileOvercoming life’s basic truth: Talent is universal, but opportunity is not.March 16, 2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The president is threatening to continue the government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, for months to come if he does not receive congressional approval for funding a border wall.“Tonight I am excited to announce that after a 17-day shutdown, I am reopening ‘The Late Show.’ I held my ground, because I kept my promise and built a wall — of mashed potatoes, around my midsection, over the Christmas holidays.” — STEPHEN COLBERTCreditCreditVideo by The Late Show With Stephen ColbertColbert made fun of Trump for saying on Twitter that the border wall should now be a “barrier” made out of steel, not concrete — in part because it is “less obtrusive.”“Oh, thank goodness. Last thing you’d want in a border wall is something obtrusive. That’s why they call it the Inconspicuous Wall of China.” — STEPHEN COLBERTPresident Trump has taken to using “Game of Thrones” iconography to push for his border wall, and on Saturday he posted an image on Twitter of himself beside the slogan, “The Wall Is Coming.” Colbert had a nit to pick with the appropriation.“You can’t say, ‘The Wall Is Coming.’ That’s mixing up two different things from the series. There’s the wall, and there’s ‘winter is coming.’ That’s like quoting ‘The Godfather’ by saying, ‘I’m going to make him an offer he can’t cannoli.’” — STEPHEN COLBERTNoah Welcomes the DemsTrevor Noah welcomed House Democrats back into power with a not-that-nostalgic look back at 2011, the last time they held a majority.“As you probably know by now, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years! That’s right, eight years. You realize, the last time the Democrats had this much power in Congress, there were only two ‘Transformer’ movies and Harvey Weinstein only looked like a creep.” — TREVOR NOAHThe Punchiest Punchlines (Bing Edition)“I read that an Arizona woman is accused of sending a man more than 159,000 texts after they went on one date. When asked why she did it, the woman was like, ‘Why, did he ask about me?’” — JIMMY FALLON“According to Reuters, Google moved $22.7 billion to Bermuda in 2017 through a Dutch shell company to avoid taxes. While over at Bing, you’re no longer allowed to flush if it’s just pee.” — SETH MEYERS“The N.Y.P.D. is looking for a man who recently broke into an Apple store and stole $75,000 worth of product. That is crazy — why would anyone need five iPhone cables?” — SETH MEYERSThe Bits Worth WatchingRoy Wood Jr. wants to be angry at R.

5cb22b0649f0eacbf1f83cbd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/opinion/china-internet-privacy.html,"In our age of digital connection and constantly online life, you might say that two political regimes are evolving, one Chinese and one Western, which offer two kinds of relationships between the privacy of ordinary citizens and the newfound power of central authorities to track, to supervise, to expose and to surveil.The first regime is one in which your every transaction can be fed into a system of ratings and rankings, in which what seem like merely personal mistakes can cost you your livelihood and reputation, even your ability to hail a car or book a reservation. It’s one in which notionally private companies cooperate with the government to track dissidents and radicals and censor speech; one in which your fellow citizens act as enforcers of the ideological consensus, making an example of you for comments you intended only for your friends; one in which even the wealth and power of your overlords can't buy privacy.The second regime is the one they’re building in the People’s Republic of China.This is a dark joke; it isn’t meant to minimize the horrors of China’s march into information-age totalitarianism. Beginning with its successful taming of the internet, Beijing has treated the darkest episodes of “Black Mirror” as a how-to guide for social control and subjugation — with “social credit” scores and official public shamings for people whose daily conduct disappoints, official Communist Party apps that you’d better use if you know what’s good for you, surveillance technologies and facial recognition software as boots on the back of nonapproved religions, and compulsory internet as part of the brutal, tech-enabled replay of the Cultural Revolution imposed in China’s Muslim west.What’s happening in the West with privacy and authority is happily different. Unlike China’s system, our emerging post-privacy order is not (for now) totalitarian; its impositions are more decentralized and haphazard, more circumscribed and civilized, less designed and more evolved, more random in the punishments inflicted and the rules enforced.This means that, for instance, there is no central party apparatus encouraging our corporations to create individual “trust scores” for every consumer (even if they’re still doing it), no official commissars organizing digital mobs (even if shaming for random wrongthink is now a commonplace), no political persecution involved in most cases where public figures have their secrets and selfies exposed on the internet. (Perhaps Jeff Bezos's claims of Saudi involvement will pan out, but so far he mostly seems to have been the victim of his own stupidity and his mistress's brother's greed.) And it means that the radicals surveilled by corporate-government cooperation are mostly white nationalists and jihadists, not human rights advocates and Christian pastors, as in China.But this list of real differences is still also a list of partial similarities, of ways in which the architecture of our system replicates certain features of the emergent Chinese panopticon, even if the life lived within our system is still blessedly freer than in theirs.Indeed our system cannot help recreating features of the Chinese order, because the way that we live on the internet leaves us naked before power in a radical new way. In the West that power is still decentralized, diffuse, divided and polarized, and therefore likely to be limited and checked. But to adapt Deng Xiaoping’s famous call for “socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" the Western order in the internet age might be usefully described as a “liberalism with some police-state characteristics.” Those characteristics are shaped and limited by our political heritage of rights and individualism. But there is still plainly an authoritarian edge, a gentle “pink police state” aspect, to the new world that online life creates.And what’s striking is how easily we have come to tolerate it. Yes, there are moments when particular organs of surveillance get pushback — the N.S.A. during the brief “libertarian moment” starring Rand Paul and Edward Snowden, the social media companies from liberals when it turned out that the Trump digital team no less than the Obama whiz kids could exploit their user data.[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]But apart from the high-minded and the paranoid, privacy per se is not a major issue in our politics. Most people want the convenience of the internet far more than they want the private spaces that older forms of communication protected. They shrug off the stalker-ish ways that corporations hurl their ads at you throughout your day. They put surveillance devices in their homes and pockets without a qualm. They accept hackings and online shamings the way a Californian shrugs off earthquakes. They assume that the extremists being surveilled and censored and sometimes arrested probably deserve it. And they welcome the possible advantages of panoptical living, hoping for less crime and less police misconduct, better public health, more exposure of corruption — plus, of course, the chance to see their favorite celebrities in the nude.So for those who object inherently to our new nakedness, regard the earthquakes as too high a price for Amazon’s low prices, or fear what an Augustus or a Robespierre might someday do with all this architecture, the best hope for a partial restoration of privacy has to involve more than just an anxiety about privacy alone. It requires a more general turn against the virtual, in which fears of digital nakedness are just one motivator among many — the political piece of a cause that’s also psychological, intellectual, aesthetic and religious.This is the hard truth suggested by our online experience so far: That a movement to restore privacy must be, at some level, a movement against the internet. Not a pure Luddism, but a movement for limits, for internet-free spaces, for zones of enforced pre-virtual reality (childhood and education above all), for social conventions that discourage career-destroying tweets and crotch shots by encouraging us to put away our iPhones.Absent such a movement we may not join China in dystopia. But the dystopian elements in our own order will be here to stay.Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.glossary replacer

5cadc78e49f0eacbf1f82486,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/style/street-photographer-jean-andre-antoine.html,"The corner of Prince Street and Broadway, in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, is one of the busiest pedestrian walkways in New York City. Dean & DeLuca, the upscale grocer, is on the southeast corner, while the Prada flagship anchors the northwest, and the two shopping meccas, along with the Apple store farther west on Prince, keep the foot traffic high. Roaming there for the past six years, stalwart through the relentless rise of iPhones and Instagram, has been a street photographer named Jean Andre Antoine.Like a fisherman working a tributary to a great river, Mr. Antoine sets up shop just outside the bustle, halfway down the block on Prince. On all but the days of harshest weather, he is out there leaning against the pinkish brick wall of the Dean & DeLuca building, which he uses as a backdrop in many of his photos. He sets his cameras and film on the fifth window ledge in. He calls the spot “the office.”Mr. Antoine was mentored by another New York street photographer, Louis Mendes, and he similarly uses an old-fashioned Crown Graphic press camera and takes portraits with peel-apart instant film, for which he charges anyone interested $20 per shot. But while Mr. Mendes goes around the city in a suit and fedora and approaches people on the street, Mr. Antoine remains fixed in one place and tries to be low-key. He never asks passers-by if they want their picture taken, instead waiting until someone is sufficiently curious to approach him.ImageMr. Antoine's station on Prince Street, outside Dean & Deluca.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesImageCreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York Times“I’m like a monk,” Mr. Antoine said. “I just sit and listen to my music and wait. Because I have this thing in my head — I think there are kindred spirits. There are people that are on the same wavelength. In a crowd of 1,000 people, we’re going to recognize each other, the antennas are going to connect.”On a recent afternoon, two young women walking west on Prince evidently were dialed to his frequency. Seeing the big camera slung around Mr. Antoine’s neck with its bellows and flashbulb, one of them asked, “What do you get here?”Mr. Antoine gave the women, one of whom was carrying a digital camera, his gentle pitch. “I’m an analog photographer,” he said. “This camera is from 1947.”The women, visiting from out of town, were told the price and agreed. Mr. Antoine posed them standing together on the sidewalk, and while they all waited for the photo to develop, Polaroid style, they talked. Then the women continued on their way holding a physical image of themselves.Such fleeting interactions are what Mr. Antoine loves about photography. In a short documentary made about him in 2016, Mr. Antoine tells the filmmaker, “I’m not even selling photos. I’m selling more of my instant work of this person, on the spot. Basically, my impression of this person as I see them.”At 35, Mr. Antoine is too young to have been around for the pre-mall SoHo, but he reminds people of the neighborhood’s more artist-centered past. Ricky Powell, himself a street photographer and downtown figure, called Mr. Antoine “a real classic New Yorker.” Mr. Powell admires his dedication. “He’s out there every day with the cameras, man,” he said. “He’s the real deal. Very humble. Very down to get a good shot.” Melissa Abe, a project manager for Airbnb, has been intrigued by Mr. Antoine’s quiet presence for years. “Jean Andre is not an outward person, but he captivates people,” she said. “He’s this good-looking guy with this cool camera, dressed cool. When you see Jean Andre, you’re seeing the old vibes of SoHo. He’s kind of a gem in our city.”ImagePicture this: Mr. Antoine photographs a passer-by.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesMr. Antoine grew up in Harlem and is of Haitian descent. He has full cheeks and warm, expressive eyes that are often hidden behind sunglasses. He wears a neat beard. He prefers to dress in black: black pants, slim black coat, black and white Adidas sneakers and either a black beanie or a black felt porkpie hat like that of an old jazz musician. The jazz association is underscored by the little wireless speaker that Mr. Antoine sets on the window ledge to play John Coltrane and Miles Davis at low volume as he works.“Coltrane represents the city,” Mr. Antoine said. “If you watch the flow of the people and traffic, up and down, he plays to it.”The old-timey camera, the porkpie hat, the jazz music and philosophical musings: These elements could easily coalesce into pretension, a gimmick to sell photos to tourists. But with Mr. Antoine, they come across as genuine. You accept that he sees the world poetically.In Ms. Abe’s view, Mr. Antoine proves himself through his constant presence on Prince Street. “He’s been showing up and doing his thing,” Ms. Abe said. She has hired him to give Airbnb guests an insider’s tour of SoHo. “It’s Jean Andre every day, on the street, creating beauty.”‘A Living in the Street’Over breakfast at El Castillo de Jagua, a Caribbean restaurant on Rivington Street, Mr. Antoine told of how in 2008, he was supporting himself shooting family barbecues and parties, weddings, some red-carpet stuff. He was also doing patient transport at New York University hospital two days a week for the steady income and health insurance. He had been introduced to photography in a community college course. After that, he dropped out of school. “I just wanted to shoot,” he said. “I didn’t want to do anything else but shoot.”ImagePedestrians in pink accessories stop to chat with the dapper Mr. Antoine.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesThis proved difficult during the financial crisis. The gigs dried up, the rent was due, and Mr. Antoine was scrambling. It was around this time, on a visit to B&H, the Midtown electronics store, that Mr. Antoine met Mr. Mendes, who often works out front. Digital technology was remaking photography. The era of the darkroom and film was passing. Everyone, including Mr. Antoine, was switching to digital gear. The vision of Mr. Mendes with his bulky old camera and flashbulbs seemed anachronistic, if not absurd.“I almost dismissed him while he was standing in front me,” Mr. Antoine recalled. “Like, ‘Dude, get with the times.’ Louis tells me, ‘You have a Polaroid camera. Why don’t you come out in the street and do what I’m doing?’” Mr. Antoine regarded himself as an introvert. “I’m, like, ‘No way I’m coming out in the street.’”But he was impressed with the images Mr. Mendes’s antique camera produced. And further impressed when he watched the older man pull in $100 with a few shutter clicks. For the next three months, Mr. Antoine shadowed Mr. Mendes, becoming his pupil. The lessons weren’t about aperture settings but attitude. He learned how to make a living in the street.“He would be in my ear: ‘You should do it. You should stop being afraid,’” Mr. Antoine said. “He was hard on me. He reminded me of my father, that rough love. He’s a big part of my life these last years.”Mr. Mendes, 78, was ill and unavailable for comment. But his manager, Ray Ortiz, said there are dozens of photographers out there whom Mr. Mendes has taught, including himself. “When I first met Louis, in 1996, he was working with a Polaroid Spectra and a Speed Graphic. He steps you up from one camera to the next,” Mr. Ortiz said. “Some start to do it, they do it for a few years and then stop. Whoever it is, if they’re willing to learn, he’s willing to teach them.”ImageFrom left, Mr. Antoine and his mentor, Louis Mendes.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesOf Mr. Mendes’s protégés, Mr. Antoine is perhaps the most committed, and most resembles his mentor in his lack of appetite for career networking. Although commercial assignments have come his way in recent years, including from Nike and Tiffany, Mr. Antoine does not aggressively pursue such work. Until someone suggested the idea, he never thought to post his photos to Instagram.“If I took your photo and you enjoyed it and I enjoyed it, that’s it,” Mr. Antoine said. “I didn’t care about whoever else seen it.”He lay his Crown Graphic, which he bought from a neighbor for about $200, on the table at El Castillo. Like many antique machines, the camera was built ingeniously and durably. It is basically a metal box with a glass lens. No electrical parts, no battery. Fully manual. Ten iPhone generations from now, it will still produce beautiful photos.The peel-apart film Mr. Antoine favors (Fuji FP-100C, a film stock ideal for commercial test shots) is another story. Three years ago, Fuji stopped making it. The fleeting quality of Mr. Antoine’s street photography, “the closest thing to a slice of time that I’ll ever get,” as he says, is made more ephemeral by the fact that one day, possibly very soon, he won’t be able to do it. Some photographers of his ilk have switched to Instax, another Fuji instant film widely available at stores like Urban Outfitters. It produces images that are smaller in scale and, to Mr. Antoine’s eye, inferior in quality. It isn’t compatible with the Crown Graphic, either, so the charm of his presentation would be lost.Like Mr. Mendes, Mr. Antoine has been stockpiling the discontinued film. He buys as much as he can get, wherever he can get it, and uses it up quickly. But scarcity has caused the price to skyrocket on the secondary market, from $8.99 for a pack of 10 sheets to $45 and risingIts eventual extinction is a source of concern for Mr. Antoine. He has a girlfriend and an infant daughter and rent to pay on an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. His family’s livelihood depends on that film. When the last camera store sells the last leftover roll, what then?ImageMr. Antoine at home on a Saturday morning.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesImageCreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York Times“I have a couple of different avenues I’m pursuing,” Mr. Antoine said, adding that he will have his first gallery show, at the Brooklyn Bank, in May.For now, he has grown more cautious with the shutter button, aware that every shot he takes “will be one shot less in the world.”‘Remnants’ of the City Mr. Antoine’s first “office” was farther north, on Broadway at Houston Street, but he found the intersection so busy, “sometimes I’d have anxiety attacks right there.” Seeking calmer turf, he moved to the sheltering facade of Dean & DeLuca six years ago and has been there ever since. He works as much as possible in the warm, late-light summers, to save enough money to last him through the hibernating days of winter, a strategy he learned from Mr. Mendes. But even in the cold, Mr. Antoine tries to be on Prince Street, because “people almost expect me to be out,” he said.On a recent weekday, Mr. Antoine got to SoHo around noon. The temperature was a relatively mild 45 degrees. He bought tea from his favorite food cart vendor on Broadway and then crossed the street to set up. He unpacked his cameras from a duffel bag — the Crown Graphic, a similar camera for a backup, a 35 millimeter camera for personal work — and placed them on the window ledge. Next, he began sticking photos on the brick wall. The color portraits of stylish men and women of every race and background, taken by Mr. Antoine, serve as advertisements to passers-by. He sipped his tea and pasted up his photos while listening to Coltrane through the little speaker. He took the better part of an hour to open for business.Without ever leaving the block, Mr. Antoine has photographed film and music stars (Spike Lee, Michael Rapaport, ASAP Rocky), artists (Mr. Brainwash) and fashion-world figures (the costume designer June Ambrose), but his main customers are out-of-towners, like the two young guys from Milan, Italy, who approached him wearing matching Yankees caps.ImageHis collection of cameras.CreditAndre D. Wagner for The New York TimesMr. Antoine guided the Italian tourists into the street to pose. His photos are souvenirs, not art shots. He makes sure to include what he calls “remnants” of the city (a yellow cab, say, or the facade of a loft building) so that people can look at the image later and place themselves in New York. Mr. Antoine’s talent is reading his subjects and getting the exposure and composition correct on the fly, in traffic, with a manual camera. With autofocus and Instagram filters, it’s a forgotten skill. Once, a teenager told Mr. Antoine that his photography looked “simple,” to which he replied, “I want you to take this camera and take one simple shot.”Mr. Antoine had no more takers beyond a vacationing couple from Puerto Rico. Foot traffic was slow this day. He didn’t seem especially bothered, or lonely. Several people who work or live in the neighborhood recognized him and came over to talk.One of them, Lawrence Schwartzwald, a photojournalist, stopped by to see what was new. He called Mr. Antoine “the Dorothy Parker of Prince Street,” proclaiming of his window ledge, “This is the Algonquin Hotel right here.”Mr. Schwartzwald left, and Mr. Antoine spent the rest of the day leaning against the wall with his Crown Graphic, “fishing,” he said. In a world that has increasingly moved indoors and gone virtual, he seemed a man out of time. The cars and pedestrians whirred by, and Mr. Antoine did what people in New York rarely do anymore: He stood on the street and watched. "

As part of her birthday present, Mr. Greenfield took her to New York City (her 3-year-old brother, Ozzie, and mother, Tess, were back home in Los Angeles). The trip included a visit to the Museum of Illusions, and that night they were going to see “Wicked.” But right now they were feeling a bit peckish.“We were thinking of tea at the Plaza,” said Mr. Greenfield, who wore trim navy jacket with shearling collar. “But this is much more our speed.”The two arrived shortly after noon and barely glanced up at the kitschy décor because they were so cold.“Daddy, have we ever been this cold before?” Lilly said.“Oh God, no,” he sad. “Never.”On the sitcom “The Neighborhood,” the 38-year-old actor plays Dave, an affable embodiment of gentrification who moves his wife and son into a traditionally black community. Culture clashes arise, and are played for laughs, as he tries to befriend the family next door, played by Cedric the Entertainer and Tichina Arnold.The show was recently renewed for a second season. “When my dad found out they got a second season, he started crying,” Lilly said, giggling.“That’s not funny,” Mr. Greenfield said, feigning embarrassment. “That’s private, I told you that!” He flashed her a smile.ImageLilly shared a photo of her 3-year-old brother, who was back home in Los Angeles.

And a frozen hot chocolate. She commandeered his iPhone to show off pictures of herself visiting the “Neighborhood” set.Lilly often visits her father there. “It’s fun,” he said. “People actually do this for a living. And I don’t want to be like, ‘You can’t come around this,’ and create some negative connotation.”Indeed, Lilly seemed to have caught the performing bug herself. She has starred as Mary Poppins in a local production for young performers, and as the Pharaoh in “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.”“An amazing performance,” her father said. “We worked really hard on it, didn’t we?”She nodded vigorously.Mr. Greenfield’s big breakout was as Schmidt on the comedy series “New Girl,” about a single woman and her male roommates navigating early adulthood.On it, he perfected a sort of well-meaning but clueless privileged white male archetype, which won him many fans. At the time he was living a bit of a double life, playing a single Lothario on screen while tending to his wife and children at home.“It’s funny to play that and then on the weekend you’re going to a 2-year-old’s birthday party,” he said.He has since diversified his portfolio. He starred opposite Sally Field in the awkward romantic film “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” had a cameo as a possible love interest to Will on the reboot of “Will & Grace,” played a drug addicted tenant of a haunted inn in Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story: Hotel” and, most recently, had a supporting role in “What Men Want,” a film starring Taraji P. Henson as a woman who can read men’s minds.After the long days required on a single-camera show like “New Girl,” Mr. Greenfield was wary of rushing into another project. “I certainly wasn’t going to take a show unless I really believed in it,” he said.In fact, he initially passed on “The Neighborhood.” But he was granted a second chance when the producers were looking to replace the lead role in the pilot. “I got to watch the pilot, which you never get to do,” he said. “So all of these unknowns when you read a script, which is terrifying, those were gone. I was like, ‘Oh, this is like a real show. There’s so many places this could go.’”The burger arrived, and Mr. Greenfield cut it in half for his daughter.“I’d always wanted to do a multicam, but they’re so hard to get right,” he said, referring to the classic sitcom format filmed in front of a live audience, which has recently fallen out of favor. “The minority used to be the cool indie show — now there’s like, seven thousand cool indie shows and we’re the minority. You want to be part of the thing you can’t find anywhere else.”Halfway through her burger, Lilly was ready for her next course. “Can I please be done,” she said.“One more big bite and I’ll order dessert,” he said. She called his bluff, reminding him that the order for the frozen hot chocolate had already been placed. “She’s smarter than me,” he said, sighing. “Not that that’s saying much.”Ten minutes later the dessert arrived with great fanfare, and she wasted no time diving in. “It tastes like melted ice cream,” she said.“You’re in heaven, I can see it.” Mr. Greenfield said.ImageCreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York TimesUp next for the actor, other than the second season of “The Neighborhood,” is the reboot of “Veronica Mars,” a noirish mystery that first aired on UPN and the CW, in which he played Leo D’Amato, a police officer. With a couple of hit shows under his belt, Mr. Greenfield sees the possibility of eternal employment, thanks to the entertainment industry’s preoccupation with reviving old shows.“I was joking recently, saying, maybe I’ll finish ‘Veronica Mars,’ and then ‘The Neighborhood’ will run five years and then we’ll do a reboot of ‘New Girl’ and then a new ‘Veronica Mars’ iteration and then ‘The Neighborhood’ revival,” he said. “I’ll have a career forever, just doing reboots.”"
5c55fcc53a125f5075c07bbb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html,"The average person would have to spend 76 working days reading all of the digital privacy policies they agree to in the span of a year. Reading Amazon’s terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately nine hours.Why would anyone read the terms of service when they don’t feel as though they have a choice in the first place? It’s not as though a user can call up Mark Zuckerberg and negotiate his or her own privacy policy. The “I agree” button should have long ago been renamed “Meh, whatever.” The legal fiction of consent is blatant in the privacy scandal du jour. Both Google and Facebook have been paying people — including minors as young as 13 — to download an app that tracks nearly all their phone activity and usage habits.Facebook advertised their app on services beloved by teens, like Snapchat and Instagram, seeking participants between the ages of 13 and 35. The sign-up process required minors to get parental consent. (How rigorous? Users simply had to scroll down and click on a check box.) In exchange for participating in what Facebook called a research project, each user received $20 a month, plus referral bonuses. Similarly, Google’s Screenwise Meter app harvested user information in exchange for money. Google was a little more careful than Facebook, barring minors unless they were participating as part of a larger household.It’s unlikely these children understood what they gave up by agreeing to use the app. And even if they’d received proper parental consent, their parents may not have understood what they were giving away on their child’s behalf. But it wasn’t the predatory nature of these programs that prompted Apple to disable them on iPhones and iPads. Rather, Apple objected to how Google and Facebook had used a loophole to transmit customer data without having to go through Apple first. In other words, it looks as though two tech giants and their armies of lawyers didn’t read the policy closely enough and violated Apple’s terms and conditions.People are often startled by what they wind up giving away by clicking on the “yes” button. They are shocked to find when they connect their Spotify and Netflix accounts to their Facebook account that those streaming services gain access to their Facebook messages. They are confused and outraged by Facebook’s uncanny ability to recommend “friends” that the company shouldn’t really know about — say, a social worker’s client, a sperm donor’s biological child, a woman’s father’s mistress. Data is powerful and can inform on us in unexpected ways. Companies learn all about you, but also all about your friends who haven’t signed up for these services. Consumers’ confusion about this gives rise to conspiracy theories that phone microphones are secretly snooping on users. According to academics who have done the research, that’s probably just paranoia. The likely truth is that all the other data you give away is enough to predict what you have said and will say in conversations.Countless devices and internet services now pervade daily life. We don’t need to live in a world governed by their terms and conditions, propped up by the legal fiction of consent. If empowered and properly funded, the Federal Trade Commission can become the privacy watchdog that this era so desperately needs. And the repeal or modification of the Federal Arbitration Act can defang the very worst provision that so frequently pops up in terms and conditions — the surrender of the right to sue a company in court.Legislation can mandate transparency about who has your data and can give users the right to stop it from being sold. New laws can lay down basic guarantees of privacy that won't require you to wade through hundreds of thousands of words of legalese. Europe is already leading the way with the General Data Protection Regulation. California has followed that example by passing a law with similar protections, scheduled to go into effect in 2020. Americans deserve strong privacy protections. Consent is not enough to replace them. The clicks that pass for consent are uninformed, non-negotiated and offered in exchange for services that are often necessary for civic life. It’s time to start seeing the “I agree” button for what it really is.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5caf107e49f0eacbf1f82a7f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/bernie-sanders-wealth.html,"“I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” With those insouciant words, Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of the “millionaires and billionaires” he has vilified for most of his career.Condolences, senator.Sanders has plenty of company. In 2018 there were 10.23 million American households with a net worth of between $1 million and $5 million, not including their primary residence. That’s an increase of about 250,000 from 2017. Another 1.4 million households are worth between $5 million and $25 million, and 173,000 households are still north of that.Nor is Sanders alone in Congress, even — or especially — among Democrats. About half of all Senate Democrats in 2018 were millionaires. That includes Virginia’s Mark Warner (worth $90.2 million, according to Roll Call), Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal ($70 million), and California’s Dianne Feinstein ($58.5 million). At the time, Sanders’s net worth came to zero, a sum that was at least consistent with his worldview (though he did somehow manage to own three homes). But now he’s flush, and destined to pay higher taxes, so maybe his opinions will change. In his biography of Harry Truman, David McCullough noted that the 33rd president was shocked by how little money was left to him after he had to pay 67 percent of his hard-won earnings in state and federal taxes.With Sanders, I won’t get my hopes up. But his experience of sudden wealth ought at least to temper the hard and ugly edges of his class-war politics. Getting rich is not a form of theft. As often as not, it’s the result of a service. Being rich is not a sin. Typically, it’s the result of long labor, patient saving, prudent investment, gutsy risk-taking, and some stroke of originality.And becoming richer is no shame. Wealth and philanthropy tend to correlate. Of America’s 10 richest people, four have given away at least $1 billion and/or 20 percent of their net worth to charity. In terms of charitable donations by individuals as a percentage of G.D.P., the United States is by far the most generous, giving $410 billion to charity in 2017. The average American gives nearly twice as much to charity as the average New Zealander, the runner-up among giving nations. A Sanders supporter might concede some of this, while rejoining that great wealth is inherently corrupting (and unnecessary), and that great inequality is inherently dangerous to democracy (and just plain wrong). That’s the thinking that now animates the movement on the left to get rid of billionaires altogether, or at least cut them down to size with punitive taxation. Yet it’s never been clear why it’s immoral to be a billionaire but not a mere millionaire — other than, perhaps, the envy that those whose income is in the 95th percentile (college professors, for instance) tend to feel toward those in the 99th (finance people). Is there a consistent moral principle that distinguishes the relative goodness of five, six or even seven zeroes in your portfolio versus the badness of eight or a full nine?It’s also unclear how Steve Jobs’s or Bill Gates’s fortunes ever denied anyone a penny, except for the dollars voluntarily shelled out to purchase iPhones and Windows. In the U.S., billionaires don’t take wealth, as Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes, or Chinese officials do. They create it. And in creating it, they create jobs, opportunities, services, choice, equity, efficiencies, and sometimes even beauty — the reason why capitalist societies are invariably more attractive and dynamic than non-capitalist ones.Is this an argument for unregulated capitalism? No. Is it a claim that billionaires have superior virtues? No. Does it suggest that the uber-rich should have greater title to our political life than the rest of us? No. Does it mean we can only find earthly fulfillment through profit-maximization rather than joy-optimization?Come on.But the idea that people can be judged as individuals based on the economic class to which they belong is one of the foulest in history, matching if not exceeding in its murderous consequences the legacies of racism and colonialism combined. When Sanders inveighs against billyinaehs (millyinaehs being presumably no longer as odious to him today as they were just a few years ago) he is engaged in a form of stereotyping that is no less bigoted, or dangerous, for being aimed at so few.Still, I won’t give up all hope that Sanders might not come to see the error of his thinking. After leaving the U.S. Senate, the late George McGovern — Sanders’s precursor in many ways — decided he would try his hand in the world of business by operating an inn and restaurant in Connecticut. It didn’t go so well.“My business associates and I,” he wrote in a memorable 1992 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: ‘Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.’ It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators.”The op-ed began with a line from Justice Felix Frankfurter: “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.” For McGovern, wisdom came at the price of bankruptcy. For Sanders, maybe it will come with the rewards of wealth.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

That’s the top asking price for a 30-second commercial during CBS’s broadcast, although some spots are going for the relative steal of $5.1 million. (Oh, and if you’re wondering, I’m a solid C, plus B if spicy wings are available.) This is the first year in a decade that the cost of a Super Bowl ad hasn’t increased — NBC charged $5.25 million in 2018 — mostly owing to waning viewer numbers. You can drop that factoid when the cheese-dip conversation hits a lull, or any of the other business and tech tidbits you’re about to devour in this email. You can have a nachos-and-beer hangover on Monday and still be on top of the news.Jan. 27-FEB. 2What’s Up? The Privacy PoliceWhich would be more fearsome in a dark alley: Apple or Facebook? We may soon find out as the companies face off over privacy standards. Both announced their fourth-quarter earnings last week, and as expected, Apple’s numbers were a flop (to blame: China’s economic lethargy and a dwindling consumer demand for iPhones). Facebook, on the other hand — or thumb? — reported record profits. It would seem that Facebook won this round — until Apple rained on its parade by shutting down an app that Facebook was using to snoop around in users’ online activity. Apple hasn’t been shy about policing privacy issues before, but this move is downright aggressive, and a convenient distraction from its bad week. Hitting the Brakes on RatesOne fear you can put to rest, if you have it: higher interest rates on your loans. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said last Wednesday that “the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat,” signaling that rates may not go up this year after all. This was an about-face from the Fed’s previous indications that it was planning to raise rates twice more in 2019. The markets were cheered by Mr. Powell’s remarks, and American stocks surged to their best January levels in 30 years. But some investors were puzzled by the Fed’s sudden change of heart, and others worried that it revealed the risk of a recession on the horizon.Venezuela Threatens VengeancePresident Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela issued a threat to the United States last Wednesday, saying if the Trump administration doesn’t quit trying to oust him and install the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, its officials would get “a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.” He’s widely viewed as an illegitimate dictator who drove his once-prosperous country into an economic catastrophe, but he’s got some heft on his side. Russia, which has provided financial and military backing to Venezuela for years, is also none too pleased about the United States’ oil sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s government. Not by coincidence, the Russian state owns part of Venezuela’s energy sector — a cash cow that it doesn’t want to lose. ImageCreditGiacomo Bagnarafeb. 3-9What’s Next? In Quite a StateNow that the government has (temporarily) reopened, Mr. Trump will deliver the postponed State of the Union address on Tuesday. He has said he will emphasize “unity,” and he will surely point to the country’s economic growth and low unemployment numbers. (January’s jobs report was better than expected, even with the shutdown.) He may also reiterate his demand for a border wall, which he said last Thursday he would build regardless of whether he gets congressional support before the Feb. 15 deadline for a new spending bill. If he decides to bypass Congress, the government could close again — which no one wants. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that last month’s shutdown would cost the country’s economy an estimated $3 billion in reduced output in 2019. To Be ContinuedChina and the United States made some progress in trade talks last week, but China still isn’t willing to make all the concessions that United States officials have demanded. So what will it take to settle this trade war before the 90-day truce ends on March 2? Mr. Trump says he wants China to buy more American goods (on top of Beijing’s recent pledge to purchase five million tons of soybeans) and open its markets to American businesses more than it has ever done. He is planning to meet with President Xi Jinping of China sometime in February, ostensibly to sign a deal in person, but details are still forthcoming (as is the deal itself).Ping-Pong, Anyone?And around we go again. British lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send the beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May back to European Union leaders to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s departure from the bloc. The problem is, those European Union leaders are done talking, as they’ve said before and will say again. That gives Mrs. May little time (and even fewer options) to come up with a new plan before the next scheduled vote in Parliament on Feb. 14, followed by the actual Brexit deadline on March 29. As a no-deal scenario appears more likely, more British companies are hoarding products and moving operations elsewhere to protect themselves from a potential economic meltdown. What Else?The record-low temperatures that gripped the country last week could cost the economy up to $5 billion in business closings, property damage, flight cancellations, power cuts and even beer deliveries. The entire nation of Tonga had to go without internet access for 11 days after an essential underwater cable was severed. And more companies are covering infertility treatments and egg-freezing costs as part of their employee health care benefits: 44 percent of big employers (those with at least 20,000 workers) offered some sort of in vitro fertilization benefit in 2018, compared with only 37 percent in 2017."

He was 86.His wife, Phyllis (Lee) Merryman, said the cause was heart and kidney failure. He had been hospitalized since late December for complications arising from surgery to install a pacemaker.In 1965, two years after he joined the electronics maker Texas Instruments without a college degree, the company asked Mr. Merryman and two other engineers to build a calculator that could fit into a shirt pocket.He designed the fundamental circuitry in less than three days, and when Texas Instruments unveiled the device two years later, the moment marked a transformational shift in the way Americans would handle everyday mathematics for the next four decades.“Silly me, I thought we were just making a calculator, but we were creating an electronic revolution,” Mr. Merryman told the NPR program “All Things Considered” in 2013.With this device, Mr. Merryman and his collaborators, Jack Kilby and James Van Tassel, also pioneered rechargeable batteries and “thermal printing,” which used heat to print numbers onto a special kind of paper. Speaking with NPR, Mr. Merryman said he was reminded of their work whenever he used a cellphone or was handed a thermally printed receipt by a grocery store cashier.Their Texas Instruments prototype, code-named Cal Tech, is now enshrined at the Smithsonian Institution, tucked between the work of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.Jerry Dale Merryman was born on June 17, 1932, at his family’s home outside Hearne, Tex., an old railroad town 150 miles south of Dallas. His mother died two days later. His father, a railroad worker, was forced to retire in the 1950s after going blind from complications of diabetes.By the time he was 11, Jerry was working for the local appliance store, repairing radios. According to family lore, Hearne police officers would hunt him down whenever their car radios broke — no matter the time of day.He learned the ins and outs of electronics from a book he picked up at the appliance store — “Radio Engineering,” by Frederick Terman — and he held onto it for the next 75 years. “He read it all his life,” his wife said.After a stint with the railroad — he packed ice into refrigerator cars carrying bananas — Mr. Merryman worked as an engineer at a local radio station. Then, in the late 1950s, he enrolled at Texas A&M University in nearby College Station. He left without finishing his degree.ImageA prototype of the first pocket calculator, developed by Mr. Merryman, Mr. Kilby and Mr. Van Tassel at Texas Instruments. The prototype, now enshrined at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, was code-named Cal Tech; this model was presented to P.E. Haggerty, the company’s president at the time.CreditNational Museum of American HistoryIn March 1963, he applied for an engineering job at Texas Instruments, near Dallas, and was hired without the traditional qualifications. “That was one of the smartest things the company ever did,” Ed Millis, who joined the company in the early ’50s and worked alongside Mr. Merryman for decades, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Merryman immediately joined a team that was developing what were called integrated circuits, the breed of microchip that would later drive personal computers. His boss was Mr. Kilby, who had helped build the first integrated circuit in 1958. (Mr. Kilby, who later shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. died in 2005.)Seven years later, these microchips had yet to find their market niche, and Texas Instruments’ president at the time, Patrick E. Haggerty, decided that the company needed to prove its worth with a consumer product. He called for a pocket calculator.Mr. Merryman was pulled into the project at the end of 1965, when he was summoned to a meeting in Mr. Kilby’s office. There, Mr. Kilby held up a small book and asked for a computer that size.Years later, when a friend mentioned that Mr. Merryman had designed the calculator’s circuitry in only three days, Mr. Merryman leaned toward him and said, “And three nights.”He, Mr. Kilby and Mr. Van Tassel initially built a prototype, which spanned an entire room at their Texas Instruments lab. Then, over the next two years, they packed the same circuit design into a hand-held casing using microchips.The device had 18 keys, and it could handle addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, printing calculations on a tiny spool of paper. It reached the market in 1970 after Texas Instruments licensed the technology to Canon, carrying a $400 price tag. Soon a second partner, Bowmar, introduced a $250 version called the Bowmar Brain.Over the next few decades, these devices got smaller and prices continued to drop, and the pocket calculator became a nearly ubiquitous household item. It lost its place in American homes only after the arrival of the Apple iPhone and other smartphones a decade ago.In addition to his wife, Mr. Merryman is survived by his daughter, Melissa Merryman; his stepdaughter, Kim Ikovic; and two granddaughters. His two previous wives, Vernette (Posey) and Sally (Simon) Merryman, died before him.During his brief stint at Texas A&M, Mr. Merryman entered a contest alongside 600 other students. They competed to see who was best at using a slide rule, the wood and plastic device that helped with multiplication, division, trigonometry and other mathematical calculations.After buying a used slide rule for $6, Mr. Merryman won the contest with a nearly perfect score. “Hearne Student ‘Pulverized ′em’ in A&M Contest,” the headline in the local paper read.Just a few years later, he helped make the slide rule obsolete."

What should we know about it?It’s The Times’s most ambitious TV project ever: a 30-minute documentary show, premiering in June, that will air on FX on Sunday nights and then stream on Hulu. We’re taking great reporting from the Times newsroom and bringing it to TV for a new audience. You should tune in.You’ve also worked at ProPublica and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” What kind of tech did you use in those workplaces?At ProPublica, we used databases like LexisNexis Public Records for people-finding, Pacer for federal court records and Factiva for news clips. Because investigative reporters are often looking for those who don’t want to be found, we’d also keep an eye out for weird sites that promised to unearth off-the-grid cellphone numbers or scrape the deep web.ProPublica has a wonderful open-source culture devoted to the public interest. Anytime they got their hands on unruly government data, the talented folks there would build an app to make access easy. Thanks to them, you can look up your doctor to see how much money he or she gets from drug companies.When I joined “Last Week Tonight,” I discovered a whole new world of video that I hadn’t known existed. Did you know there’s a database where you can search all of President Trump’s video appearances, including a vlog he kept from 2011 to 2014?

We use Frame.io to share or watch cuts of episodes.More old school: giant spiral-bound notebooks. It feels soothing to write in them. But if I need to work from home after hours, I sometimes end up having to take photos of my handwritten notes.What tech do you love to use in your personal life and why?My husband has Sonos speakers set up around our apartment. It often feels as if I use them to fill every moment at home with podcasts and news. Every once in a while, I remember how nice it is to listen to music instead.For reading, I use email newsletters and Instapaper, and we share a Kindle account so we can read the same books. I use Twitter to find unusual news or stuff that makes me laugh. I fall down Instagram rabbit holes all the time. An unexpected app I still use is Foursquare. I love seeing all the spots where my husband and I went 10 years ago.I have no interest in Alexa, but we do have SmartThings, which sends your phone an alert every time your front door opens. I just got a letter that our (low-tech) building is installing a new buzzer system that has facial recognition.

But on principle, I resent that there’s barely any choice of cable TV providers.I spent a while infecting my laptop with God-knows-what from various Napster-esque video streaming sites.But now it’s so easy. We have Apple TV, where we subscribe to apps from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Showtime and HBO and then buy anything else a la carte from iTunes. Sometimes, I listen to the audio podcast version of shows like “60 Minutes” or PBS’s “Frontline.”I know that sounds like I must watch a lot of TV, but I swear I really don’t. It’s fun to follow the TV industry like sports — keeping an eye on what’s new, what’s a hit and what has bombed. You can learn a lot about the world by understanding what people watch on TV!What do you do to take a break from tech?Hot yoga. Sixty minutes in a 100-plus-degree room standing on one leg.

The NYT reports that F.A.A. employees and a Transportation Department watchdog worried over the years that the agency had “too close a relationship” with Boeing officials. Lawmakers will also ask why an update to the jet’s anti-stall software is still not ready.Boeing’s response to the crisis is also being questioned, particularly since its C.E.O., Dennis Muilenburg, has largely remained silent. “Their comments have been very engineering-esque,” Richard Levick, a communications expert, told the NYT. (The company’s public response has become more assertive since hiring the crisis communications firm Sard Verbinnen.)The company will meet today with 200 pilots and airline representatives at the factory where the Max 8 is made. It’s expected to offer some updates on the anti-stall software.More Boeing news: A Max 8 made an emergency landing in Orlando yesterday, though the incident is not thought to be connected to malfunctions that may have led to the two recent crashes.Europe adopts tough new copyright rulesThe European Parliament voted yesterday to pass a new copyright law requiring technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians, authors and news publishers in order to post their work online, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.“The new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively, rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting,” Mr. Satariano writes.The policy is deeply divisive. Digital rights activists and the tech industry say it could result in censorship. Media organizations say it should protect Europe’s creative industries and ensure companies pay for content they share online.Some digital business models could be affected, because website owners will take on more responsibility for what ends up on their platforms. Sites may find the law too expensive or cumbersome to police: Even Google shuttered its News service, which would require licenses from publishers under the new rules, when a similar initiative was introduced in Spain.Smaller organizations may be hit hardest. These websites contend that giant tech platforms already have the resources to comply with the law, Mr. Satariano writes.ImageOklahoma’s attorney general, Mike Hunter, announcing the settlement with Purdue Pharma.CreditMike Simons/Tulsa World, via Associated PressPurdue Pharma pays $270 million to settle an opioid lawsuitPurdue Pharma, the drug maker behind OxyContin, said yesterday that it will settle a lawsuit by Oklahoma’s attorney general over its role in the opioid crisis, Jan Hoffman of the NYT reports.Purdue and its owners will pay $270 million, far more than they have paid in previous settlements. The payout helps Purdue avoid a televised trial that was scheduled to begin on May 28.But many more legal battles await. A federal judge in Cleveland alone is overseeing a consolidated collection of 1,600 lawsuits, and 35 other states have sued Purdue as well.The settlement raises questions about a Purdue bankruptcy. The company has contemplated filing for Chapter 11 protection to help contain the cost of defending or settling its legal fights. In bankruptcy, lawsuit claimants would most likely get only a fraction of any court-determined payout.Chapter 11 weighed heavily in the Oklahoma case. The state made a bird-in-the-hand decision, and other plaintiffs may need to make a similar choice. “The concern is that counties and states may settle on the cheap early to avoid getting little to nothing later on,” Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, told the NYT.Wall Street bonuses widen gender and race pay gapsNew data about Wall Street compensation shows that the financial sector’s huge pay has widened the national disparity between white men and women and people of color, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank.New York City’s financial sector bonus pool fell last year by 14 percent from the previous year, to $27.5 billion. But that is still three times bigger than the combined annual earnings of all U.S. full-time minimum-wage workers.A majority of financial workers are white men, especially at the top ranks, according to the institute. No less than 68 percent of senior managers at the five largest U.S. investment banks are white men.But they make up just 37 percent of America’s minimum-wage workers, who have full- or part-time jobs that pay $7.25 an hour. “Due to Washington inaction, the federal minimum wage continues to be a poverty wage, while the reckless bonus culture is alive and well on Wall Street,” the report concludes.ImageApple and Qualcomm’s patent fight revolves around older iPhones.CreditJerome Favre/EPA, via ShutterstockIn Apple vs. Qualcomm, both sides notch winsAs at least 80 patent fights between Apple and Qualcomm trickle through courts around the world, both companies scored victories yesterday, the WSJ reports.Some iPhones now face a U.S. import ban after an International Trade Commission judge issued an initial ruling yesterday finding that Apple had infringed a Qualcomm patent.But Apple scored a bigger victory when another I.T.C. judge ruled that the phone maker had not infringed a Qualcomm patent relating to power efficiency in mobile phones. That overturned a previous court finding.“Qualcomm is hoping a victory, particularly an import ban, could give it greater leverage in technology licensing negotiations,” Bloomberg explains. “Qualcomm says it’s due billions of dollars in unpaid royalties on the iPhone.”“Apple denied infringing any of the patents in the two cases and claimed Qualcomm is trying to shut its only U.S.-based competitor out of the market, something Apple argues will hinder the development of the fifth generation of mobile communications,” Bloomberg adds.Stock buybacks are bigger than everCorporate America set a record for stock repurchases last year, even as lawmakers proposed curtailing the practice.Companies bought back $806.4 billion worth of their own shares, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with $223 billion of that coming in the fourth quarter alone. The previous high was $589.1 billion, set in 2007.The biggest buyer was Apple, which repurchased $101 billion of its stock.The buyback boom was fueled by the Trump tax cuts, with companies preferring to use their savings to repurchase shares and bolster their stock prices, rather than issue dividends or make new investments.And it came despite opposition from Congress, with lawmakers from Senator Bernie Sanders to Senator Marco Rubio arguing in favor of limits on the practice.But a repeat is unlikely this year, as the sugar rush from the tax cuts wears off.ImageGoogle’s robotics lab.CreditBrian Dawson for The New York TimesGoogle’s robot reboot is all about softwareIn 2013, Google started an ambitious and flashy effort to create robots under the control of Andy Rubin, who later left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment. Now, the company has overhauled the effort with more modest goals — but subtly advanced technology, Cade Metz of the NYT reports.Google’s first robot push was all about advanced machines, and was built on a series of acquisitions. Some of the companies that Google bought relied on humanoid robots, but the tech giant failed to capitalize on them, and sold off or shut down the companies over time.Now the focus is on making robots smarter by injecting them with machine-learning software. “The company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own, like sorting through a bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating a warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles,” Mr. Metz writes.“Google is tight-lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on,” Mr. Metz adds. That’s probably because most researchers see robots being used in warehouses and distribution centers around the world, raising questions about how automation will erode jobs.Revolving doorDealBook exclusive: The Brunswick Group plans to announce this morning that it has hired Michael O’Looney, most recently head of communications at Elliott Management, as a partner in New York and Courtney Chiang Dorman, who previously was the C.O.O. of the law firm Wilson Sonsini, as a partner in San Francisco.JC Penney hired Bill Wafford, most recently the chief financial officer of The Vitamin Shoppe, as its C.F.O.Simon Sutton is reportedly stepping down as HBO’s chief revenue officer.The speed readDeals• Lyft reportedly plans to raise the price range of its I.P.O. amid strong investor demand.

5c67151c3a125f5075c09f97,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/cellphone-store-robberies.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The detectives and police officers who rushed to a T-Mobile store in Queens on Tuesday night were responding to one of the most fraught scenarios in policing: A robbery inside had turned into a hostage situation.Shortly after the officers arrived, the robber is said to have raised his gun — which turned out to be a fake — and made motions as if he were shooting. Seven officers opened fire. A detective was killed and a sergeant wounded in the crossfire.The tragic event was in every respect unpredictable, except for one: the location. Over the last decade, cellphone stores have joined banks, bodegas, liquor stores and jewelry shops as common robbery targets.The high price that top-of-the-line cellphones fetch on the black market, both abroad and in the United States, makes the stores attractive to thieves.“You do the math,” the chief of detectives of the New York Police Department, Dermot Shea, said. “You hit a store and steal 75 of those.” Even if robbery crews were able to unload them for only 25 percent of their store price, he said, “It’s a good hit.”Banks use dye packs to deter robbers. Jewelers and shop owners have on occasion been known to shoot first. But cellphone stores tend to have little security and lots of valuable inventory.“These businesses are easy targets,” John B. Devito, the special agent in charge of the New York field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said in a statement.The bureau operates a robbery task force with New York City detectives that has seen its case load shift in recent years toward cellphone store robberies.Last year, there were 71 robberies of cellphone stores in New York City, Chief Shea said. It was not immediately clear how that compared to past years.The robbers often, though not always, belong to organized crews that in some cases have been known to hit a different location every week or so. Last year investigators determined that there were 19 separate patterns, each one typically involving a different crew.“When we see one you can almost set the clock because we’re going to start getting others till we catch them,” Chief Shea said.Christopher Ransom, the 27-year-old accused robber shot inside the T-Mobile store on Tuesday, was also being sought for a series of phone store robberies going back to October, the police said. The most recent happened on Jan. 19 when, the police said, Mr. Ransom brandished what appeared to be a gun and stole several cellphones and about $850 from a RSK3 Wireless shop in South Jamaica, Queens.The police said Mr. Ransom had an accomplice in the T-Mobile store robbery who arrived with him in a cab and waited outside the store while he went inside. That person was being sought for questioning on Friday, the police said.Mr. Ransom, who was still recovering in a hospital, was arraigned on murder, assault and robbery charges on Friday afternoon via a closed-circuit video link to state Supreme Court in Queens, the district attorney’s office said. A judge ordered him held without bail. A criminal complaint said he had demanded employees open a safe full of iPhones just before the police arrived.Mr. Ransom is not alone in being suspected of hitting several stores. Late last year prosecutors accused one man, Khalif Watson, of a particularly prolific robbery spree. He was accused of robbing phone stores in Brooklyn and Queens on five days in late March and early April.In most of those robberies, investigators said, Mr. Watson brought along a laundry bag to use to carry off his haul. Mr. Watson has since pleaded guilty to racketeering charges that include not only robbery charges, but accusations of murder.In some cases, investigators believe the phones are sold to fences who ship them overseas for resale. “We know they get shipped — it could be to China, it could be to the Middle East — we see them go to many countries,” Chief Shea said.But the majority of the phones stay in New York City, according to a Police Department analysis.Chief Shea characterized the robbers in a typical crew as “stickup guys who know each other, either they served time together or know each other from the neighborhood.”Court records offer a glimpse of some of the men arrested in recent years for the crime.One, Ronald Mack, was an emergency medical technician for the city Fire Department who had once stolen credit card information from a patient in his ambulance before he was charged with robbing a cellphone store.Another, Ayoub Mankouche, who told the police that he used to smoke nine marijuana cigarettes a day, used a black pellet gun to rob a Brooklyn T-Mobile store in September 2016, according to court records. Mr. Mankouche forced employees and customers into a back room, but a customer managed to disarm him during a struggle.“The defendant gambled that the store was a soft target,” prosecutors wrote in a brief in Mr. Mankouche’s case. “He was wrong.”There are signs that cellphone companies or retailers are beginning to do more to stop robberies. For example, a box containing a cellphone taken from a Verizon store in Queens during a robbery last April also held a tracking device.Detective William J. Puskas, who is on the federal robbery task force, said in an affidavit that officers were able to track the stolen phone to a car, which eventually led to an arrest."

Sign up here.)Apple’s big media unveil was light on factsIn the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled an audacious plan yesterday to dominate the digital services that run on its devices — a new monthly subscription service for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card. But it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer.• Apple TV Plus will offer new original content, as well as programs from channels like HBO and Showtime. Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston took the stage to make the announcement, but details — even about fundamentals like pricing — were glaringly absent.• Apple News Plus gives access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker and National Geographic, as well as newspapers like the LAT and the WSJ for $9.99 a month. But it’s unclear whether you’ll get all the content — business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full WSJ subscribers, who pay $39 a month, for example — so it’s not quite as robust an offering as it first seems.• Apple Arcade is a video game subscription service that will launch later this year. Surprise: No details were given about how much it would cost, or which games would be included.• Apple Card is the company’s new credit card, which has been developed with Goldman Sachs. It’s meant to work mainly on the iPhone, with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through Apple Pay. Some important questions you might have — such as credit limit and interest rate — weren’t answered.The company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer — and we still have little idea about either.Gig-economy companies try to shape labor laws, state by stateLobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes:• In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a “digital network” to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.• That’s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.• This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.• Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.• Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.• “Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,” Mr. Scheiber writes.ImageMichael AvenattiCreditSpencer Platt/Getty ImagesAvenatti is accused of trying to extort NikeLast year, Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her fight against President Trump. Yesterday, he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of Nike.Mr. Avenatti threatened the sports giant, saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits — unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least $22.5 million, prosecutors said.“The company will die — not die, but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut, and that’s what’s going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public,” Mr. Avenatti told Nike lawyers in a meeting that was recorded.The federal charges were announced around the time that Mr. Avenatti tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference to accuse Nike of “a major high school/college basketball scandal.”“When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday.Parliament seizes the Brexit process, for a dayBritain’s lawmakers grabbed control of the nation’s departure from the E.U. yesterday, in a move that highlights the struggles of Prime Minister Theresa May, Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Parliament gave itself power to vote on alternative Brexit plans. “Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs. May prepared for a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan, which has already been rejected twice by huge margins,” Mr. Castle writes.It will hold a series of votes tomorrow on alternatives to Mrs. May’s plan. “These could include a so-called ‘soft Brexit’ that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures; a second referendum, revoking Brexit completely; or leaving without any deal,” Mr. Castle explains.“Mrs. May said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes, particularly if they contradicted the pro-Brexit stance in the Conservative Party’s manifesto for the 2017 general election.”But the situation challenges Britain’s political traditions, where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament, and “could create a constitutional showdown,” according to Mr. Castle.Uber will buy its top Middle Eastern rivalThe ride-hailing giant said this morning that it will acquire Careem, its main competitor in the region, for $3.1 billion, Kate Conger of the NYT reports.The deal comes ahead of Uber’s I.P.O., and could give a boost to the company’s financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival. It also gives Uber immediate access to several markets where it doesn’t currently operate, including Iraq, Morocco and Palestine.The deal represents a change in strategy, since Uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like Didi Chuxing of China and Yandex of Russia.But it could raise privacy concerns, Ms. Conger writes. Careem will keep operating under its own name, but will eventually share some features with Uber. Though Uber has declined to share user data with the Egyptian government, Careem was more open to doing so.ImageRick Singer, right.CreditCj Gunther/EPA, via ShutterstockHow financial firms unwittingly fueled the college admissions scandalAt the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is Rick Singer, a higher-education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools. The WSJ traced one way he operated: partnering with financial advisory firms.• He was a regular on the financial speaking circuit, the WSJ reports, “which allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment.” His services often spread through word of mouth.• “Mr. Singer listed work with other financial-services firms, including Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley, on his website and social media.”• “Employees at bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co., based in Newport Beach, Calif., twice invited Mr. Singer to speak about the college-admission process, and the company said some there used his legitimate services.” (Douglas Hodge, the former C.E.O. of Pimco, as the company is known, has been charged in the bribery scheme.)• “In November 2017, for instance, an employee at a Los Angeles-based financial adviser emailed Mr. Singer, introducing him to a parent who wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools’ for his daughter, according to federal filings, which don’t name the firm.”DE Shaw pioneered quant investing. Next: A.I.DE Shaw may be best known as the hedge fund where Jeff Bezos began his career. But as Robin Wigglesworth of the FT writes, it was also an early leader in computer-driven investing — and is now betting on A.I.-enabled stock picking.• “Many in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realize the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.”• “People have gone insane about this, but in a good way,” Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive chairman who owns 20 percent of DE Shaw, told the FT. “We are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well.”• DE Shaw keeps its operations shrouded in secrecy. “They’re really smart, but I’ve never quite understood them,” one quant hedge fund manager told the FT.• But there’s reason to be skeptical of its current approach, Mr. Wigglesworth writes. “Wall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain skeptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.”• “Some rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma — a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives — has eschewed their former colleagues’ hybrid methods.”Revolving doorSeth DuCharme, the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, will join the staff of Attorney General William Barr.

5c9c9b8049f0eacbf105f7e6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/opinion/tech-regulation.html,"This election season, Americans are going to hear a lot about regulating big tech. Senator Elizabeth Warren has already kicked off that debate, and it would be the tone-deaf candidate who wasn’t alert to the increasing anxiety among the public over the power Silicon Valley giants wield. According to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center, 57 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Republicans feel that big tech companies should be regulated more than they are now.A candidate who fails to address these issues in a meaningful way is not taking these concerns seriously. But how should we, as citizens, evaluate these proposals?Any effort to regulate big tech will have to address two main issues. The first is consumer protection. When the private sector controls so much of our data, Americans should be able to know who has access to this data and how they use it. The second issue relates to “platform companies,” services that connect two or more sides of a transaction: Google Search connects people with websites, Amazon connects buyers with sellers, Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android connect consumers with apps, and so on. The concern is that platforms can build services that compete with third-party services running on their platforms, and can easily give themselves an unfair advantage.The more visible concern is consumer protection, particularly protections for privacy. Any regulation addressing consumer protection should, first, specify whether consumers have the right to access data that companies store about them and whether firms are allowed to share confidential data with a third party.Just as important, the policy should say whether companies are allowed to make socially consequential decisions, such as mortgage approval or job recruiting, based on that sensitive information. If so, are those companies required to tell consumers what decisions might be based on such data? relatedMore on Silicon ValleyOpinion | Marcus Ryu: Silicon Valley Needs RegulationSept. 11, 2018Opinion | Tim Wu: Be Afraid of Economic ‘Bigness.’ Be Very Afraid.Nov. 10, 2018Opinion | Zeynep Tufekci: We Already Know How to Protect Ourselves From FacebookApril 9, 2018These efforts get even more complicated and less transparent when algorithms are involved. Some of the best-performing algorithms, such as neural networks, are not easily interpretable, even to their programmers. At the same time, modern machine learning algorithms are susceptible to the same gender, race, and age biases that affect human decisions. While these concerns are particularly notable with big tech, they are just as relevant for retail, health care or financial services firms. Any proposed consumer protection regulation should include formal audits by companies to verify that their algorithms are fair, preserve privacy and are reliable, at least in settings where algorithmic decisions have social consequences, such as hiring, news curation and school admissions.Proposals to regulate big tech also have to deal with how platform companies treat the firms that offer products, content or services on their platforms. Anticompetitive practices can stifle innovation and also limit consumers’ ability to easily switch to alternative products or services on the platform. Anticompetitive practices include, among other things, giving preferred placement to a platform’s own products and blocking third-party services from access to certain platform features. For example, Yelp has repeatedly accused Google of deprioritizing its pages on Google search results. Similarly, Spotify has complained that Apple forces app developers to use its payment platform for processing in-app purchases; this ability to charge Spotify a commission gives Apple Music a pricing advantage over its rival.We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age: Share Your StoriesFeb. 13, 2019Senator Warren suggests that platforms should not be allowed to offer services. Under her plan, Amazon Marketplace, for example, would not be permitted to sell AmazonBasics products, which competes with marketplace sellers. In theory, banning platforms from offering their own products and services would offer protection against anti-competitive behavior. But in practice, it is difficult for a new platform with few users to lure third-party service and product providers. So platforms often have to build some core services when they launch. The original iPhone, for example, lacked an app store and mostly featured apps developed by Apple, including apps for note-taking, weather and messaging. This attracts an early base of users, who demonstrate that people want that service, in turn drawing other companies that might be able to provide a better version of that same service.Companies also sometimes launch services and then wake up to their platform potential later. Amazon, for example, set up its marketplace many years after its launch as a bookseller. Moreover, deep integration between platforms and services is sometimes useful to consumers: Payment is built into Apple’s iOS platform in part to increase security and convenience. Might these benefits be worth the competitive disadvantage to third-party payment services such as PayPal?This brings us to the regulatory question: Where should regulators draw the line that separates platforms from the services built on the platform? A clever proposal will be one that manages to create a logical way to separate services that are essential for a platform to exist (and which the platform is therefore allowed to operate) from those that platforms either must not operate or, if they do, must be treated in the same way as third-party services.Yes, some of this gets technical, but we need an informed citizenry on tech regulation, just as we do for the political debates over health care, jobs or foreign policy.

5c77114f49f0eacbf105a86a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/mwc-2019-5g-huawei.html,"BARCELONA, Spain — The Trump administration sent a delegation to Spain this week to make its case against the Chinese technology company Huawei at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows. But the event, called MWC Barcelona, ended up being favorable ground for the Chinese maker of telecom equipment. Of the more than 100,000 attendees and 2,400 companies at the event, most ignored the efforts by the United States to impose a ban against Huawei for security and surveillance risks. Instead, they chose to focus on the coming introduction of long-hyped next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G, not to mention new foldable smartphones, robots and other internet-connected devices.ImageThe Swedish company Husqvarna demonstrated a connected smart mower.ImageA 3-D body scanner at a stand by ZTE.For Huawei, the enormous conference provided a much-needed opportunity to make a show of force after months of being on the defensive about the American-led campaign. The company, accused of being an instrument of spying for the Chinese government, was ubiquitous in Barcelona. Huawei had the biggest and most popular booth, which looked like a sprawling indoor city that took up half of a convention hall. The booth featured a demonstration area for its new smartphones, an Instagram-ready digital pond, and a roaming robot. Its outdoor picnic area was catered with Iberian ham, Chinese meat buns, fresh fish and Mediterranean salads. Even the lanyards worn by conference attendees were Huawei-branded. ImageTesting virtual reality technology at the MWC in Barcelona, Spain.MWC Barcelona is akin in scope and hype to the annual CES show in Las Vegas, one of the world’s largest consumer electronics events. MWC Barcelona fills eight conference halls with loud, sensory-overloading booths from companies including Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, Microsoft, Nokia and Ericsson. While overwhelmingly male, the event is more diverse than most tech conferences, with people from countries around the world attending.

I am particularly excited about the potential change on education, transportation and the internet,” she said.ImageLuca de Meo, the chief executive of Seat, presenting his company’s new smart car, called Minimo. “We want to be champions of connected cars,” he said.On Tuesday, after Huawei’s chairman, Guo Ping, used a keynote speech to give a full-throated defense of the company, it hosted one of the week’s biggest parties on the grounds of a stadium that was used during the 1992 Olympics. American officials were left to hold a hastily called news conference on Tuesday at a booth operated by the Spanish government. They didn’t present any new evidence against Huawei. The conference previewed many of the hottest mobile trends, particularly the capabilities of new hyperfast 5G networks. For years, the technology has had more promise than actual uses. Executives said the faster networks would debut this year, with wider adoption coming in 2020 and beyond. To show the utility of 5G, the Chinese company ZTE programmed a band of industrial robots to play piano and drums at the event to illustrate how the ultrafast networks can be used by heavy machinery. Flight simulators, car-racing games, drones and internet-connected beer kegs were also available for testing.

Last year, smartphone sales fell for the first time since Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007. Long a reliable engine of growth in the tech industry, smartphone demand is now sputtering. People are holding on to their devices longer, and there aren’t many new markets where smartphones aren’t already prevalent. More than five billion people worldwide now subscribe to a mobile phone plan, according to GSMA, the industry trade group. VideoRobotics on display at MWC.Following Apple’s lead, many companies introduced new handsets at MWC Barcelona with prices that a few years ago would have seemed unfathomable. In Barcelona, Samsung showed its previously announced $2,000 Fold handset with a bendable display. Huawei has introduced a competing foldable device, called the Mate X, which will cost about $2,600 and be available around the middle of the year outside the United States. “People are demanding more from their phones,” said Maxime Guirauton, a marketing director for Samsung in Europe. “Innovation comes at a price.” ImageHewlett-Packard displayed research on plants growing in space missions.ImageAfter a speech at the T-Mobile display.Microsoft introduced a new augmented reality headset, HoloLens 2, which costs $3,500 and is targeted more at businesses than general consumers. People formed long lines to try the gear, including using the goggles in a demonstration to fix water-sanitation equipment. Google also had a large presence at the show, with its Android software powering the noteworthy new handsets unveiled in Barcelona. The internet company scattered people around the conference dressed in white jumpsuits to help show off the Google Assistant virtual assistant. Standing at the Samsung booth, Carolina Milanesi, an industry analyst with Creative Strategies, said it was hard to judge how new products introduced this week would fare with customers. Success for gadgets such as a foldable phone will depend on whether there are applications that people are eager to use. “That’s what’s going to determine whether this is a niche, a fad or mass market,” she said.

5c54aa193a125f5075c079e2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/style/winter-fridays.html,"Every Friday in the winter, if her clients don't have any pressing needs, Anne Sholley gets to leave work after lunch.While her friends are still slaving away in their offices, sometimes in the dark or during snowstorms, Ms. Sholley, the program director for Highview Creations, a company in New York that designs and installs green roofs, swims laps at the Metropolitan Recreation Center in Williamsburg or practices yoga at Shala Yoga House in Fort Greene. Sometimes she is in her car getting a head start for a ski weekend at Sugarbush Resort in Vermont or a relaxing getaway in the Catskills.Welcome to Winter Fridays.In the last few years Summer Fridays have become common in certain sectors of the white-collar work force, like publishing and public relations, with professionals scurrying off from work early to get in a long weekend of sun and heat.Now others are doing the same in colder months.Highview Creations gives Friday afternoons off in winter in part because the company can’t afford to in the summer. “Summer is the most intensive time for landscape design, and we are putting in 50 to 60 hours of work a week,” Ms. Sholley, 30, said. Employees can only hibernate when their plants do.But other institutions are following suit to keep up morale in the most gloomy months, or, in the case of some Jewish nonprofits, for example, to honor religious practices. Because Shabbat starts at sunset, many observant employees need to get home by 3 or 4 p.m. in the winter. While it’s a fun policy for non-Jews, it can also be kind of confusing. The Jewish Museum, for example, changes its Friday work hours every week by 15 minutes, based on when the sun sets.At least one school is also experimenting with a shortened schedule.Six Fridays every winter, Kristin Koehler’s 12-year-old son, Christopher, gets to leave his classroom at Robert C. Parker School in North Greenbush, N.Y., and head to Jiminy Peak, a nearby mountain resort. He and his classmates take an hourlong ski lesson and then get free time with their friends. Those who don’t want to ski can choose ice skating, swimming or cross-country lessons at nearby facilities.“It gives them a chance to take a risk and try something new,” Ms. Koehler said.The school planned the program, officially called Winter Fridays, to get kids outside during the darkest part of the year. “It’s dark and it’s cold, so we have this little lift,” said Laura Graceffa, the head of school at Robert C. Parker. “It lightens things up for our students and teachers.”The school invites parents along. “We give them an excuse to do something outside,” Ms. Graceffa said. “They get to tell their boss, ‘I need to go chaperone my kid at school.’”Parents working at certain companies across America wouldn’t even need special permission to take time off; these firms have adopted a four-day workweek regardless of the season. Why discriminate against winter? Also, are we not now working 24/7, with our constant refreshing of company email on iPhones and unpaid laboring over social-media content?Every other Friday, during the entire year, the World Wildlife Fund’s office in Washington, D.C., has what it calls Panda Fridays: 26 in total. The practice helps the company lessen its carbon footprint by reducing heat, electricity, utilities and vehicle emissions from commutes. It also encourages employees to achieve a greater work-life balance, another company mission.Scientific studies conducted in recent years conclude that a four-day week helped employees be more productive and happy at work.Sarah Fogel Berger, the World Wildlife Fund’s deputy director of media relations and external affairs, calls them her “saving grace,” as someone who also has a child. She spends most of her Panda Fridays paying bills, going to the grocery store, going to the doctor and having lunch with her mother. “I booked our family’s summer beach house last Panda Friday,” she said.You might think Ms. Sholley would be envious of such an arrangement, but she’s philosophical about her seasonal perk.“Sometimes I do wish I had Summer Fridays, because I tend to go to Cape Cod where my family is from and nothing is worse than summer traffic,” she said. “But now everyone has Summer Fridays and is on the road at 2 p.m., so it’s getting canceled out. The traffic on Winter Fridays tends to be much lighter.”"
5c7950ae49f0eacbf105ae1c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/style/darcy-carden-the-good-place.html,"Janet, the all-powerful virtual assistant (imagine an intergalactic Alexa) on the metaphysical sitcom “The Good Place,” does not have a tattoo. But D’Arcy Carden, the actress who plays her, does. Three fletched arrows — a tribute to her three siblings and a play on her maiden name, Erokan (“arrow-can,” get it?) — nestle just below her left elbow.Ms. Carden, in New York recently to take a few meetings, wanted another. Which explains why she was spending a snowy Friday sunk into the pink velvet couch of Rosa Bluestone Perr, a tattoo artist with a private studio in the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. She practices a style of tattooing called “stick and poke,” which made Ms. Carden a little apprehensive. “Those words are so intimidating,” she said.Still, Ms. Carden, 39, her hands wrapped around a mug of peppermint tea, considered her tattoo options. She had thought about getting a crown, a homage to a “weird little chant” her father used to do (“You are the king of the world!”). She had also considered getting a tattoo of her husband’s birthday. But she ultimately decided on a “¢” symbol, in honor of her dog, Penny, a floppy-eared pit bull rescue.ImageMs. Carden got her tattoo at the Brooklyn studio of Rosa Bluestone Perr, right. CreditNina Westervelt for The New York TimesImageCreditNina Westervelt for The New York Times“She’s, like, my new love,” Ms. Carden said. “I’ve loved my dad for many decades. And I’ve loved my husband for many years. But I’m newly in love with my dog.”After growing up in central California and studying theater at Southern Oregon University, she moved to Brooklyn about 15 years ago, taking improv classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade and working as a guide for the Ride, a sightseeing tour in Manhattan. She and her friends were short on cash, “trying so hard to do what we loved,” she said. “I mean, the amount of, like, pizza. And it was such a struggle. And it was such a good time.”Five years ago, she and her husband, Jason Carden, an actor and producer, moved out to Los Angeles, to the Silver Lake neighborhood, “which is kind of Brooklyn-y,” she said. Just when despair was kicking in, the roles came: a loopy spin instructor on “Broad City,” an acting student on “Barry” and a lead role as Janet on “The Good Place,” in which she plays opposite Kristen Bell and Ted Danson. (Coordinating the shooting schedules for multiple comedies is no joke.)Working on a fizzily optimistic show like “The Good Place” is “healthy for me,” Ms. Carden said. “It’s about imperfect people trying to be better.”After finishing her tea, Ms. Carden took out her iPhone to show Ms. Perr some of the designs she liked. (The phone had a picture of Timothée Chalamet on the home screen. “I thought I’d do Chalamet across my chest,” she joked.)“This one spoke to my brain the most,” she said, pointing to a cent symbol haloed by diamonds, though Ms. Carden wanted a topper of three dots instead, to represent “Me, Jason and Penny,” she said.Ms. Perr uploaded the design to her computer, tweaked it and then sent it to a printer. In the meantime, she had Ms. Carden sign a liability waiver. “Are you trying to scare me?” Ms. Carden said.With the stencil in hand, the two women stood in front of a full-length mirror to figure out where the tattoo should go. They quickly decided on the area beneath Ms. Carden’s right wrist bone, which would be a slight hassle for the makeup artists on “The Good Place,” but until Janet gets a tattoo upgrade, that’s that.ImageThe tattoo took all of 15 minutes.  CreditNina Westervelt for The New York Times“You can’t overthink it, but you totally have to overthink it, but then you have to just go, like, ‘I know I like this,’” Ms. Carden said, sounding like she was trying to convince herself and mostly succeeding.Ms. Perr had Ms. Carden lay faceup on a red massage table. “This is very like the gyno,” Ms. Carden said. Ms. Perr pulled on some black plastic gloves and a gold ring that held black ink. She wet Ms. Carden’s wrist with a lotion called Stencil Stuff and applied the stencil, almost like a temporary tattoo. Then, holding a needle she began to stick and poke Ms. Carden’s wrist, refilling the needle every poke or two, and leaving a dot of ink beneath the skin with each poke. That was less like the gyno.Ms. Carden, who very sensibly does not love needles, had been worried about the pain. But it wasn’t so bad. “Oh, I could do this all day!,” she said. With her free hand she answered a FaceTime call from her husband. “We’re doing it,” she said. A couple of “I love you”s and the call was over. Fifteen minutes later, so was the tattooing.“It’s just perfect,” Ms Carden said.Ms. Perr bandaged it, telling her not to swim or immerse herself in water for two weeks and to gently wash the tattoo with unscented soap and maybe apply a little coconut oil.“I love it,” Ms. Carden said. “Yup, this is my tattoo and I love it. I love it.”Hopefully, the dog will, too."
5c521e953a125f5075c07310,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/facebook-earnings-revenue-profit.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s worst year ever was its best year ever when it came to its business.After a string of scandals in 2018 damaged its reputation and raised questions about its handling of people’s data, the social network said Wednesday that it had gained new users around the world in the fourth quarter and reported a record profit. Facebook also posted its full results for 2018, which showed its total revenue and profit reaching record levels.The  results suggested that advertisers had continued to spend money on the site and that users were not deterred by Facebook’s issues, which include the spreading of disinformation and election meddling. The company had said last year that it expected its growth to slow as it spent to improve the privacy and security of its users.“One of the biggest questions people have about Facebook is whether we can make the massive investments we’re making to monitor and protect the platform while we keep growing our business,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in an interview on Wednesday. “This quarter shows we can do both.”Yet even as its growth continued, Facebook began de-emphasizing its core social network and started highlighting its family of apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Facebook said it would eventually stop sharing user numbers for each individual service and instead provide one combined figure for all of its apps.The change is part of a strategy by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to knit together its businesses into one overarching network. Last week, The New York Times reported that he planned to integrate the technical infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so that people could talk across the services for the first time. The move, which the company hopes to complete by the end of the year or by early 2020, could provide Facebook opportunities for additional revenue from messaging activity and would increase the utility of all of the apps.In a call with investors on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg confirmed the report, calling the move an eventual boon for users. People want messaging that is “fast, private and reliable,” he said.The moves followed a difficult year for Facebook, as questions about the unintended consequences of social media have sharpened. The company has faced scrutiny over improper handling of its users’ data, its largest-ever security breach last year, and the distribution of false content and foreign influence campaigns across its network.This week, Facebook has been grappling with a report by TechCrunch that it paid people to install an app that would suck in all of their phone and web activity. That has renewed questions about Facebook’s approach to user privacy and prompted criticism from Apple, which oversees iPhone apps.For its fourth quarter, Facebook’s revenue rose 30 percent from a year earlier to $16.9 billion, while profits jumped 61 percent to $6.9 billion. Seven million advertisers spend money on the platform, the company said, and in a shift, more than two million now buy ads in Facebook’s Stories, one of its newer products.Facebook also said its daily active users had risen 9 percent from a year earlier to 1.52 billion, the same rate as in the previous quarter. Notably, the number of new users increased in every geography; in previous quarters, growth stagnated in the United States and in Europe. In total, Facebook said, 2.7 billion people now use its core social network and its other apps.The company added that its estimate of fake accounts on its site had jumped 27 percent from the third quarter to 116 million, while duplicate accounts rose 12.5 percent to 255 million.The overall results surpassed Wall Street estimates and sent shares of Facebook soaring more than 11 percent in after-hours trading. The company’s share price had plunged about 34 percent over the past year, down from a high of $218 in July.Facebook also said it expected that other investments in new products in areas such as e-commerce and payments systems would yield new revenue streams.Still, executives cautioned on Wednesday that profit margins would begin to thin in the coming year. Facebook increased its number of employees to more than 35,000 in 2018, up 42 percent, as it added more people to fight disinformation and moderate content on the site. Operating expenses will keep rising, the company said, as Facebook hires in key areas to deal with the issues.“A lot of our business challenges have been self-imposed,” Mr. Zuckerberg said on the call."
5c6fe0763a125f5075c0afe7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/dealbook/us-china-trade-talks.html,"Good Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)U.S. frustrations grow over China trade talksChina’s vice premier, Liu He, is scheduled to hold face-to-face trade talks in Washington today, before attending a meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office. There is still plenty to be discussed.“The tone of the negotiations between the two nations has grown more stern,” according to Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport of the NYT, citing unnamed sources. “American officials have come to realize that China has been repackaging promised reforms and trying to sell them as concessions to Mr. Trump,” which has “caused deep frustration among the administration’s China hard-liners.”Here are some of the key issues on the table:• Trade deficits. The two nations have “reached consensus on how to alleviate the trade imbalances,” Reuters reports. “Washington and Beijing are looking at a 10-item list for that, including additional Chinese purchases of agricultural produce, energy and goods such as semiconductors.”• Currency stability. U.S. negotiators are said to be demanding that China stop devaluing its currency as part of a deal. But CNBC reports that such a measure is “likely to encounter little resistance from the Chinese” because the nation’s central bank also wants the same thing, according to economists who spoke with the network.• Settling chip spats. “U.S. and Chinese negotiators are trying to resolve a long-running dispute between semiconductor rivals Micron Technology and Fujian Jinhua as part of a larger trade agreement,” the FT reports.• Enforcement mechanisms. “Negotiators have struggled this week to overcome differences on specific language to address tough U.S. demands for structural changes in China’s economy,” Reuters reports, including “an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China complies with any agreements.”“The final terms of the deal are likely to be worked out in a meeting or phone call between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump himself,” Ms. Swanson and Mr. Rappeport write. That means that Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, must now “narrow the suite of disagreements down to just a handful of remaining issues for the president to negotiate.” It’s unclear how long that might take.Kraft Heinz’s $15.4 billion problemThe processed food giant announced yesterday that it had taken a $15.4 billion write-down, earned less than expected and been subpoenaed by the S.E.C. Unsurprisingly, that spooked investors and raised big questions about its strategy.Blame changing tastes for the write-down. Peter Eavis of the NYT writes that the hit affects the company’s U.S. and Canadian operations and the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, and “appears to come from a shift in how consumers eat, emphasizing fresh food over processed products.” The earnings miss, Kraft Heinz said, was because it didn’t deliver enough cost cuts.And accounting questions brought the S.E.C. inquiry. Kraft Heinz said that an accounting cost related to vendor contracts should have been recorded in previous quarters, but that the misstatement “was not material.”Investors, including Warren Buffett, also took a big hit. Shares fell by nearly 21 percent in after-hours trading. Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which is one of Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholders, saw the value of its holdings drop nearly $3 billion yesterday, to $12.9 billion.Kraft Heinz may need a reboot. The company’s fundamental business model — promoted by 3G Capital, the investment firm that pushed Kraft and Heinz to merge — is buying companies and then cutting costs. But the strategy could sputter, writes Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Opinion: “Who would want to sell to Kraft Heinz now?”ImageCreditTolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMixed messages over a tweaked Brexit dealAs the British Parliament heads toward a vote next week that could strip control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May, there is confusion about the current state of play.There was “no breakthrough” in talks between two of Mrs. May’s key ministers and E.U. officials during meetings in Brussels yesterday, according to Bloomberg. Her government has been trying to convince Europe to renegotiate the existing withdrawal plan, but E.U. officials have repeatedly declined to do so. Mrs. May is expected to hold more talks with E.U. officials at a meeting in Egypt this weekend.And there are unclear signals about progress. Philip Hammond, Britain’s finance minister, said last night that a revised deal could be put to a vote in Parliament as soon as next week. Unnamed government officials have since tried to play down those claims. One unidentified source told Reuters, “It doesn’t feel like we will have a deal by next week.”But the E.U. reportedly expects a delay. “Discussions between the two sides suggest May will ask for an extension to the two-year negotiating period if the British Parliament backs the Brexit deal but it isn’t signed off until an E.U. summit on March 21-22,” Bloomberg reports. “That is emerging as the EU’s current plan.”More Brexit news: Euro-skeptic Conservative Party lawmakers are threatening to back out of crucial votes, which could paralyze Mrs. May’s Brexit efforts. A no-deal Brexit could cause chaos for the London-Paris train line run by Eurostar. Mrs. May’s government is said to have delayed a report on the impact of tariffs to avoid a backlash. And deal or no, Britain’s currency is in trouble.Might Trump go easy on Huawei?The Trump administration has been branding Huawei as a threat to national security for months now. But yesterday, President Trump hinted that he may be softening his stance on the company.Mr. Trump wants 5G in the U.S. “as soon as possible” according to a tweet he posted yesterday. But, intriguingly, he wants the U.S. to win the race for the next-generation wireless technology “not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies.” (He also wants 6G technology, which doesn’t yet exist.)That could be seen as an olive branch to China. “Some officials in Mr. Trump’s administration have been pushing for him to sign an order that could result in U.S. companies being barred from buying Huawei technology at all,” the FT reports. “Experts believe the president’s tweet signaled he was backing away from such an action, possibly as a way to soften up Beijing for a wider trade deal.”It comes as Huawei is winning over U.S. allies. Despite pressure from Washington to exclude the company’s equipment from national wireless networks, countries like India and Canada are continuing to rely on Huawei products because a) they work, and b) they’re cheap. And Britain and Germany both seem to be open to using the company’s hardware.ImageStephanie Ruhle of MSNBCCreditAndrew Toth/Getty Images for NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalBy day, MSNBC anchor; by night, Under Armour’s adviserUnder Armour’s board grilled the athletic equipment company’s founder and chief, Kevin Plank, last year, the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources.

Prices on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note have risen this year, pushing down its yield to 2.69 percent, from 3.23 percent just three months ago.”• “Stock and bond prices are not supposed to rise and fall in tandem. Historically, when investors fret about the future, they pull money out of stock markets and buy relatively safe United States Treasury securities.”• “Investors are in a familiar situation: An economy that isn’t strong enough to compel the Fed to raise rates but is strong enough for corporate America to keep expanding its bottom line.”• “But how long this so-called Goldilocks scenario can persist will depend on the Fed’s plan for rates and the United States-China trade negotiations.”Revolving doorMark Frissora will stay on as C.E.O. of Caesars Entertainment longer than expected, as the casino company faces pressure from Carl Icahn.Spencer Rascoff stepped down as C.E.O. of Zillow, the real-estate company.

5c5347dd3a125f5075c075db,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/science/mars-curiosity-rover-mount-sharp.html,"A mountain on Mars that is almost as tall as Denali in Alaska appears to be surprisingly light, scientists reported on Thursday.For more than four years, NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Mount Sharp, located within an ancient meteor impact crater known as Gale and rising more than three miles high. Now measurements of tiny changes in gravity, recorded by the rover as it climbed in elevation, could help solve the question of how the mountain formed.The official name of the mountain is Aeolis Mons, but mission scientists have nicknamed it after Robert P. Sharp, a Mars expert who died in 2004. It consists of layer upon layer of sedimentary rock, which offer an easy-to-read history book of Martian geology. That was one of the attractions that led NASA to choose the site for the Curiosity mission, which landed on Mars in 2012.But sedimentary rocks typically form at the bottoms of lakes and oceans, not at the tops of mountains.Some scientists surmised that the 96-mile-wide Gale crater was once a lake that slowly filled to the brim with sediment, which was then blown away by winds, leaving Mount Sharp. Others suggested that particles blew in from other parts of the planet and piled up at the center of the crater in the shape of a mountain.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]In the new research, published on Thursday in the journal Science, the gravity measurements indicated that the rocks beneath Curiosity were not solid but porous, lowering their density. This finding suggested that the crater was never completely filled with sediment, because the porous rocks would not have been strong enough to support all of the weight without being compressed.That conclusion fits in with the notion that both hypotheses of Mount Sharp’s formation are true in part, said Ashwin R. Vasavada, the mission’s project scientist and an author of the Science paper. Its bottom may consist of carved-out lake sediments, while the top part may have built up from windblown particles.“That’s an idea that’s been gaining strength,” Dr. Vasavada said.ImageA view of Mount Sharp taken by Curiosity in January 2018.CreditNASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS, via Associated PressThe findings were the result of a clever technical improvisation, using sensors that were intended to provide engineers with information on the status of the rover. Doing so effectively added a new scientific instrument to Curiosity, years after the rover landed on Mars.The brainstorm came from Kevin W. Lewis, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the mission team. He realized that modern devices such as smartphones have chips that measure the forces of acceleration. That’s how an iPhone knows to rotate the screen depending on whether you are holding it vertically or horizontally.This kind of sensor, known as an accelerometer, can measure changes in the pull of gravity. On Earth, geologists use variations in gravity to probe for underground features such as earthquake faults and ore deposits. “Wouldn’t it be wild if we had something like that on Mars?” said Dr. Lewis, the lead author of the Science paper.Then he realized that there were indeed accelerometers on Mars. The Curiosity rover was using such devices to track the tilt of the vehicle as it moved across the surface.Those measurements provided a record of the force of gravity on Curiosity. “Luckily, the engineers had already been taking a perfect data set, basically since day one,” he said.Because the sensors were not meant for Dr. Lewis’s purpose, the data were “quite noisy,” he said. “The data would jump around pretty severely from day to day.”After calibrating the measurements and averaging out the variations, the researchers found that gravity indeed waned slightly as Curiosity climbed about 1,000 feet in elevation. But it was less than what would have been measured if Curiosity had been hoisted 1,000 feet into the air. That is because of the additional gravitational attraction from the mass of the mountain.The change in the force was small. For a person who weighs 150 pounds on Earth (and just 57 pounds on Mars because of the weaker gravity), climbing 1,000 feet up Mount Sharp would shed about one-tenth of an ounce.ImageA computer generated image showing Mount Sharp rising from the center of the Gale Crater.CreditNASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/UAThe researchers calculated that the bedrock under Curiosity had a density of about 100 pounds per cubic foot. However, the minerals that make up the rocks were about 70 percent more dense than that. This led Dr. Lewis and his colleagues to conclude that the rocks must be porous.John P. Grotzinger, a geology professor at the California Institute of Technology who served as the project scientist during Curiosity’s first three years on Mars, said Dr. Lewis’s idea to tap into the engineering data was “a great example of real scientific creativity.”But he was less certain of the conclusions. Curiosity’s examination of the rocks at the surface suggest that sediment grains are tightly cemented together, not porous. Dr. Grotzinger also noted sizable swings in the gravity measurements, even when Curiosity was moving on roughly level ground. That means that the material beneath Mount Sharp might not be as uniform as assumed in the calculations by Dr. Lewis and his colleagues. The gravity data might reflect low-density geological structures deeper underground, not the properties of the Mount Sharp rocks.“You just have to somehow invent a geologically plausible scenario,” Dr. Grotzinger said. “To me, it leaves some wiggle room.”Recent reporting about Mars‘This Could Be the End’ for NASA’s Mars Opportunity RoverJan. 25, 2019Hear the Sounds of Wind on Mars, Recorded by NASA’s InSight LanderDec. 7, 2018NASA’s InSight Mission Has Touched Down on Mars to Study the Red Planet’s Deep SecretsNov. 26, 2018NASA Mars 2020 Rover Gets a Landing Site: A Crater That Contained a LakeNov. 19, 2018"
5c94f46c49f0eacbf105e80c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/opinion/end-of-cars-uber-lyft.html,"I will die before I buy another car.I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend.Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?Finished. [Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think.Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought.I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank.Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon.Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized.That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all.It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not.Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all.

She lived mostly in Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn, always with roommates, some of them strangers she met through Craigslist. From the start, she was eager to become a homeowner.“Pretty much every apartment I’ve had is living below my means and saving with this goal in mind,” she said.Last spring, as she started hunting seriously, Ms. Reichman moved in with her boyfriend and his roommate, who rented in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “The girlfriends glommed on, to save money,” she said. “Four of us crammed into a two-bedroom.”Read about what you need to do to become a first-time buyer.Ms. Reichman, 27, who grew up in Baltimore, had a budget of up to $300,000 for a co-op unit farther out in Brooklyn. Her boyfriend would be joining her and helping to pay monthly costs, but she needed to be able to afford it on her own, in case he moved away for graduate school. If a one-bedroom proved too pricey, a studio would do, preferably one with an alcove and separate kitchen.“I never wanted to be able to smell food from my bed,” Ms. Reichman said. “And I wanted the bedroom to feel like its own little nook.” She was willing to take on an hour’s commute to her office in Midtown, where she is a video producer for Barron’s Group. “I am a huge podcast listener, so the commute doesn’t bother me that much,” she said.ImageThe 600-square-foot studio is neatly divided. The former owners redid the floors for Ms. Reichman before she moved in, and she repainted the walls and retiled the kitchen floor.CreditKatherine Marks for The New York TimesShe contacted Carol Nemeroff, a family friend and a licensed sales agent at Douglas Elliman. “I was, like, five thorns in her side,” said Ms. Reichman, who knew she would need a lot of hand-holding.They saw a charming, newly renovated studio in Ditmas Park listed at $299,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $400s. It had a foyer rather than an alcove, but its beautiful archways and prewar details made up for the less-than-ideal layout. Ms. Reichman bid $301,000, but it sold for around $311,000.“I offered the most I could possibly afford, and it still wasn’t enough, and that was a huge disappointment,” she said. “That apartment had everything I wanted, and I had to peel it back from there as far as reasonable expectations.”ImageShe liked a charming studio with beautiful archways and prewar details in a Ditmas Park building, but was outbid. “I offered the most I could possibly afford, and it still wasn’t enough, and that was a huge disappointment,” she said.CreditKatherine Marks for The New York TimesPrices in Ditmas Park were on the high side, so she refocused on neighboring Kensington. An alcove studio there, on the ground floor next to the building’s mailroom and staircase, had big windows with shrubs and flowers outside. “It was just good enough, but not something I really loved,” she said. The price was $285,000, with maintenance of just under $500. It later fell to $265,000 and sold for $262,000.More about First-time Buyers Buying Your First Home?

It was nicely renovated and had a window seat in the kitchen. The price was $269,000, with maintenance in the low $600s. But Ms. Reichman was too late: There was already an accepted offer of $272,000.By now, it was early summer. “The inventory felt like it was gone, and the buying season was over,” she said. “I had sort of made peace with the fact that the apartment hunt was over until the next year.” Still, she said, “I was checking StreetEasy nonstop, trying to make a miracle happen.”Lo and behold, a new listing appeared. It was in the same Kensington building as the ground-floor studio, but was larger, with nearly 600 square feet. The online photos were underexposed and blurry. “I could tell they were bad iPhone pictures,” Ms. Reichman said. The price was $260,000, with maintenance in the high $500s.The floors were a mess. The bathroom had a tiny shower stall and no tub. The view included a parking lot. “It was a dumpy apartment,” she said. “There were so many not-great things about it that I thought, ‘This is my chance.’”ImageShe considered several apartments on Ocean Parkway, including one on the sunny top floor of an elevator building. It was nicely renovated, but already had an accepted offer.CreditKatherine Marks for The New York TimesAlso, she and Ms. Nemeroff got locked inside while the selling agent was in the hall. “When we tried to leave, it wouldn’t let us,” Ms. Reichman said. “I took that as a sign.” She quickly offered $268,000.“We went a little bit over,” Ms. Nemeroff said. “She didn’t want to lose another apartment. If the apartment was not perfect, it was fine. Her criteria were more about having that little alcove and getting to work in less than an hour. She didn’t need to have a cute coffee place down the block.”The sellers, who had children, had added walls. The outlines showed on the floors, which the sellers offered to redo.Ms. Reichman and her boyfriend arrived in the fall. She is surprised at how few people have heard of Kensington, which is smack in the center of Brooklyn and just south of Prospect Park.With the help of relatives, she repainted the walls and retiled the kitchen floor. She had the finicky lock changed and bought houseplants. A hutch and a table serve as room dividers.ImageThe commute to work from her new building takes just under an hour, including 10 minutes to the F train, “if you are power-walking,” she said.CreditKatherine Marks for The New York Times“We can pretend it is a one-bedroom,” she said. “I was happily surprised that 600 square feet felt like a real apartment. This is a test for me and my boyfriend. If we can do this, we can live anywhere together. I’ve lived in so much worse than sharing a 600-square-foot studio with one other person.”Her trip to work takes just under an hour, including 10 minutes to the F train, “if you are power-walking,” she said. If need be, “I can message in and say, ‘Here’s the tweet that says the trains are delayed.’”And Ms. Reichman is glad to put effort into “doing the unsexy stuff that comes with being a homeowner, like replacing the exhaust fan in the bathroom and the light fixture in the entryway,” she said. “That kind of stuff weirdly makes me happy.”Email: thehunt@nytimes.comFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

5c922b9f49f0eacbf105e0d4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/technology/personaltech/taffy-brodesser-akner-interviews-technology.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who occasionally writes for Arts, discussed the tech she’s using.You’re known for writing profiles of people like Tonya Harding and Bradley Cooper. What tools do you use to make sure people forget they’re in an interview and that they open up?I have a small Olympus WS-801 recorder, but I don’t think they ever forget about it because I don’t. I’m constantly checking to make sure it’s really running and the volume is really up. But it’s not, like, equipment. I’m not wearing headphones or using a microphone. I never ever ever ask anyone to speak directly into the recorder, unless there are very extenuating circumstances. Hasn’t happened in a while. Some of the people you write about have chaotic schedules, and they probably surprise you with unexpected interview times. What do you do, and what tech equipment do you need to have at the ready for these sudden interviews?I have been at basketball games with my kids and dentist appointments (my own!) when suddenly a secondary interview — the only kind I’ll do on the phone, though I’ve spoken with primary subjects on the phone after our meetings for follow-up — comes in. I always have my Olympus on me. I have one on my desk at work and one in my bag at all times.I also use this incredible, simple contraption called the Olympus TP-8 Telephone Pick-up Microphone (no, I am not sponsored by Olympus, but, hey, Olympus, if you’re reading this, give me a call), which hooks up to my tape recorder, goes into my ear, and therefore picks up both my end and the other end. ImageThe Olympus WS-801 digital voice recorder and Olympus TP-8 Telephone Pick-up Microphone.CreditVincent Tullo for The New York TimesIt’s like $21, and whoever thought of it should win a Nobel. I have a transcriber, a very nice woman, who gets upset at me if I do interviews while we eat or if the sound quality is terrible, and during those moments, it is her I am serving more than anyone else. I see people using iPhones or TapeACall, and those things are so unreliable-seeming and tenuous I can’t bear it. It would absolutely affect the interviews if I were worried on that level about sound and the thing working. How do you use social media tools to communicate with celebrities and other people whom you profile? I never communicate over social with people I’m writing about. I give them my card at the end of our first meeting and put my cell onto it, and if they have something they forgot to tell me or are worried about, they can contact me. It has led to a lot of further interactions that have really made the story. Also, it’s helpful to ask Bradley Cooper over text what kind of hat he was wearing rather than go through other people, particularly during film promotion time. I’m not so organized all the time, and sometimes I don’t think to ask pertinent questions until I read the transcript or realize I want to describe something I saw that I didn’t ask about in the room.When people you write about share a story or not share what you’ve written on social media, what do you generally consider that to mean?God, that’s a hard one. I think it’s really hard to be written about. You’re essentially vulnerable to a stranger. I feel very bad for everyone I write about. I tell them before publication: “You can read this if you want, but it’s not really for you. It’s about you, but it’s not for you.” When someone asks if it’s a good or a bad story, I always say, “It’s not good or bad, it’s a third thing.” Some people want to stay in touch. Some people never want to see me again. There are very few people who have hated their story. But that’s not the same as the person being comfortable with it. If I do a good job and tell the intimate story that I, as a reader, want to read, then probably that person I wrote about never wants to be in a room with me again. This is a long way of saying: I don’t take it personally. I don’t even notice most of the time when it happens, because I unfollow people pretty quickly because the experience was also very intense for me, and it’s sad to me that I have these short-lived intensive relationships and then they’re over. Like, when “Shakespeare in Love” used to come on HBO, I’d watch it. Now I have a hard time watching it. When I see Gwyneth, I have every emotion I had when I was reporting and writing and closing and publishing that story, which is the opposite of escapism.Do you use social media less or more over time and why?I really like it and sometimes I hate it, but I can’t really chart it. Instagram is boring mostly. Facebook is boring, but I like seeing my friends and their kids and their dogs and stuff. I met one of my best friends on Twitter, Reyhan. Twitter! You can meet a best friend and get an alt-right trolling on the same day! Who could have predicted this? I do know that if people love your story and there’s a real thunder on social media, there’s a twinge because you know if you like it too much, you’ll have to one day experience its inverse, which is the incredible internet dragging that awaits each and every one of us. I don’t think I really answered this question."
5c93eda149f0eacbf105e586,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html,"This month at the Palazzo Grassi, looking out over the Grand Canal in Venice, visitors will find a beautiful new floor in the atrium, made of thousands of Italian marble tiles.Only once they’re upstairs, looking down on the entire mosaic, will they see that it depicts a cluster of sparse pine trees. And when they read a wall label, they’ll learn that the evergreens were planted along the border of a Nazi concentration camp, to hide it from public view.The mosaic is the centerpiece of a major retrospective of the Belgian contemporary artist Luc Tuymans, opening at the Palazzo Grassi on March 24 and running through Jan. 6, 2020. It is based on Mr. Tuymans’s 1986 painting “Schwarzheide,” named for a forced-labor camp in Germany where many inmates were worked to death.ImageMr. Tuymans in his studio in Antwerp, Belgium, in January. Good painting is multilayered, Mr. Tuymans said: “If it’s not, you’re either making propaganda or you’re making an illustration.”CreditMashid Mohadjerin for The New York TimesMr. Tuymans is credited with bringing painting back in the 1980s, by pioneering a style of figurative painting based on found images. His palette is almost always muted shades of gray, and his forms are blurry and washed-out, suggesting memories of things faded from view.The mosaic may be a departure from his usual medium, but it is also emblematic of his trademark sleight of hand: Mr. Tuymans gives us an image that may make us feel one way, but when we find out what it is — through a title, a wall text, or, in this case, a new perspective — its meaning changes, often in an unsettling way.His work has often reflected on history, in particular World War II and Belgian colonialism, but often concerns current affairs, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the war in Iraq. One of his most famous works is a 2005 portrait of the former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice; another is his 1986 “Gas Chamber,” a blanched-out image of an empty space at Dachau.Image“Schwarzheide,” Mr. Tuymans’ painting from 1986 on which the Palazzo Grassi mosaic is based.CreditStudio Luc Tuymans, AntwerpAt his Antwerp studio in late January, just before his works were to be picked up for shipment to Venice, Mr. Tuymans smoked cigarette after cigarette and tried to figure out whether the Palazzo Grassi show, with more than 80 paintings plus the mosaic, is his largest to date, out of some 150 solo shows in the last 30 years. Two thirds of the works on display will be recent, from 2016 to 2018, he said.“I made it a point not to show the most topical works,” he said. “This is much more about understatement.” (Some of those the more overtly political works will be shown as part of a retrospective of about 50 paintings at the De Pont museum in Tilburg, the Netherlands, runing from June 29 though Nov. 17.)Bart de Baere, the director of M HKA, the leading contemporary art museum in Antwerp, said Mr. Tuymans doesn’t invent images, but rather repurposes them, and his source material is often drawn from magazines, film stills, Polaroids, internet images and his own iPhone photos. “His primary artistic action is in the choosing of an image,” he said. “Part of that is the awareness of the fact that the image is part of a context and that any choice is partial. No choice is neutral.”Image“Le Mépris” depicts a still from the Jean-Luc Godard film, known as “Contempt” in English.CreditStudio Luc Tuymans, AntwerpThe exhibition in Venice is titled “La Pelle” (“The Skin”), a reference to the Italian writer Curzio Malaparte’s 1949 novel, which is set in Naples just after the liberation of that city by the Allied forces at the end of World War II. The novel reflects on how residents of the city have been simultaneously conquered and liberated; they were both co-conspirators and victims of the war.“A lot of Tuymans’s works are about the human paradox of being ‘good’ and ‘evil’ at the same time,” the exhibition’s curator, Caroline Bourgeois, said in an email exchange. She cited as examples Mr. Tuymans’s portraits of the Japanese murderer and cannibal Issei Sagawa, or a smiling Ku Klux Klan leader, Joseph Milteer, painted from photos in faded colors and innocuous poses.Mr. Tuymans’s fascination with moral complexities may derive from his upbringing. He’s the child of a Dutch mother and Belgian father with conflicting World War II loyalties. His mother’s family worked in the Resistance while his Flemish family were Nazi collaborators. The uncle after whom he was named was in the Hitler Youth — a fact he learned from an old photo.ImageCreditMashid Mohadjerin for The New York Times“It was known and not known,” Mr. Tuymans said. It came up, sometimes, during family arguments, but, “It was referred to as being wrong or being right, and there was a whole moral fence connected to it.”Mr. Tuymans said that only one painting in the show, “Le Mépris,” is actually a direct reference to the Malaparte book. That work is based on a still from Jean-Luc Godard’s film of the same name, known in English as “Contempt”, starring Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. The film used Malaparte’s cliff house on Capri, Italy, as the setting for the unraveling of a marriage.“Good painting is diverse in the sense that it’s multilayered,” Mr. Tuymans said of the work, a painterly representation of an image from a movie, based on a novel. “If it’s not, you’re either making propaganda or you’re making an illustration.”The Palazzo Grassi mosaic, too, has many layers to it. A reworking of Mr. Tuymans’s painting, which he said was in turn based on charcoal drawings made by slave laborers from the Schwarzheide work camp. Fearful of being discovered by guards, according to Mr. Tuymans, they ripped the images into long strips and hid them, and survivors pieced them together again.“He has put his finger on problems of our time, by referring to past events or to current ones without depicting them, but rather evoking historical issues,” said the De Pont Museum’s director, Hendrik Driessen, who curated the upcoming exhibition there. “They freeze a moment in time in such a way that they evoke a lot more than just that single moment he’s chosen.”Mr. Tuymans has chosen many such reverberative moments in the survey that he co-curated with Ms. Bourgeois. He said said they chose then to hang, “in juxtapositions, in a way that creates a kind of tension.” With works on show spanning nearly 40 years, Mr. Tuymans said he hopes the exhibition will give visitors a sense of his overall oeuvre: “The idea of finalizing things, but leaving them open-ended still.”"

I’ll do that basically twice so that’s 4 miles. Or I’ll go right on the river and I’ll run up to 145th street and back; or I run down to 57th street and back.

5c2f51843a125f5075c02d48,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/china-economy-central-bank.html,"HONG KONG — With the Chinese economy beginning the new year on a decidedly downbeat note, Beijing’s leaders are injecting more than $200 billion into its financial system to ease lending.The People’s Bank of China on Friday said it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves by one percentage point. The move will essentially free up 1.5 trillion Chinese renminbi, or about $218 billion, for an economy experiencing weaker factory output and consumer confidence while it weathers a trade war with the United States.The cut is not unusual for China’s central bank, but it comes amid uncertainty about how Beijing will manage slower growth. China’s slowdown has contributed to shaky global financial markets. On Wednesday, underscoring the broad impact, Apple unexpectedly cut its sales forecast for its latest quarter, citing disappointing iPhone sales in China, once one of its most vibrant markets.Chinese officials pledged last month to step up support of the economy, and they are facing new urgency, said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, a research firm. Retail and auto sales are down, and China’s latest manufacturing data showed factory activity shrank in December. While monthly data released on Friday showed improvement in China’s services sector, the overall picture has become more concerning.“The consistently downbeat tone of the data released since then will only have underlined the strains the economy is facing,” Mr. Williams said.This month, China will report economic growth figures for the last three months of 2018. While China’s headline growth figure is widely seen as unreliable, it dipped in the third quarter to 6.5 percent, its lowest level of expansion since the aftermath of the global financial crisis.The move by the central bank on Friday appeared to be part of a coordinated effort. Earlier in the day, Li Keqiang, the country’s premier, said China would move to shore up the economy through measures that included cutting bank reserve requirement ratios and lowering taxes.The central bank said it would cut its reserve requirement ratio — a measure of how much cash from deposits that lenders need to keep — by half a percentage point on Jan. 15 and another half a percentage point by Jan. 25.The move will give banks more leeway to lend money, though analysts noted the net amount of money flowing into the system would be roughly half the $218 billion headline figure, as the central bank shuts off other sources of funds. It also comes roughly a month before China’s Lunar New Year holiday, when Chinese households sometimes strain the monetary system by spending more and by giving cash as gifts.China has traditionally used its state-controlled banking system to flood the economy with money when growth slows. Last year, China cut the reserve ratio four times. But economists, small businesses and many others say the mechanism shovels money into big, inefficient companies or into investment bubbles instead of toward the smaller entrepreneurs who need it more.The cut “will be good for curbing the economic downturn and solving the financing difficulties of enterprises,” said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.“But this is just one policy,” Mr. Yu added, saying it risks pouring money into real estate and the stock market, which would do little to solve the economy’s problems. “We need a lot of other policies to cooperate.”For several weeks, economists and analysts have speculated that officials could move to push a hefty stimulus package that would give the flagging economy a shot in the arm. But such bold moves have become increasingly difficult for the Chinese government, which is contending with a huge debt load accumulated over the last decade to spur growth.Still, many analysts took the move as a sign that China’s leader would be proactive in heading off any worsening slump.“The central bank has made it clear that this wasn’t ‘releasing the floodwaters’ by providing a huge stimulus comparable to that introduced in 2009, but it is clear that they are redoubling efforts to stabilize the economy and the currency,” Geoffrey Yu, the head of the British investment office of the Swiss bank UBS, said in an email.“This swift action supports our view that there won’t be a sharp deceleration in the Chinese economy this year and that fears of a major global slowdown are overdone,” Mr. Yu added."
5c6305033a125f5075c094d1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/your-money/taxes/file-taxes-phone-mobile-app.html,"Smartphones are for Fortnite. Or for scanning your favorite news app. But are they for taxes?A surprising number of people apparently think so. About eight million people used the TurboTax app to file their returns on mobile last year. Credit Karma said that 20 percent of its tax customers used their phones to file in 2018, and that nearly a third of them did so in less than an hour, which suggests they didn’t run into time-sucking trouble along the way.Alas, I wasn’t one of them.I’ve always entrusted taxes to my accountant, but when I was assigned to evaluate the process of doing one’s taxes by smartphone, I figured the software would be wizardly enough. My family’s situation isn’t that complicated: a couple of W-2s, a couple of kids, some miscellaneous income.But my experience filing by phone felt like a chore, with a fair amount of grunt work, compounded by the small screen and tiny keyboard that make many tasks harder than on a desktop computer.  There are about 463 things I’d rather do than read I.R.S. Publication 463 to figure out whether mileage is a deductible expense, yet when I summoned help through the TurboTax app, an agent suggested that I should. Other apps also raised questions I couldn’t easily answer, and I even identified an error.I sampled three mobile apps, from TurboTax, Credit Karma and H&R Block. All of them said I’d receive a refund of roughly the same amount, give or take $40, so I was somewhat reassured that my returns were accurate. But even after going through the process three times on my iPhone, I had lingering questions, and I wouldn’t have been willing to file our return to the Internal Revenue Service without human intervention.[The Wirecutter reviews tax software for standard computers.]It wasn’t all bad. Parts of the mobile experience were surprisingly painless. H&R Block went a step further than its two competitors, offering me the chance to upload my family’s 2017 tax return to help us get started. I was convinced it wouldn’t work, but it did, seamlessly, all from my phone. This saved me the grief of entering four Social Security numbers and other tediousness.Snapping a photo of our W-2s and uploading them on all three apps instead of having to type all of that information into my phone was similarly easy, though the results were far from perfect, which really defeats the purpose. The apps transferred a lot of the numbers, but I had to add a few lines and correct others on TurboTax and H&R Block — and a few more lines on Credit Karma. It’s true that taking photos did save some time, and the app providers said some taxpayers use this feature, then complete the task from the comfort of their larger machines.The hardest part of this exercise involved getting assistance on how to categorize my husband’s nonwage income, for his job as a television host.Credit Karma didn’t offer any human helpers. On TurboTaxLive’s app, I asked to speak with a live agent — a feature that is also available in the online version — and was given a phone number to call. Initially, I reached an automaton. After explaining that I was calling about business deductions, it texted me several related links, but they were three years old so I wasn’t sure they’d apply under the new tax law.So I held for an actual enrolled agent, someone with qualifications granted by the I.R.S. After nearly 40 minutes on the phone, I still wasn’t sure that I had definitive information, the kind of answer my human accountant would have in four minutes.Your Taxes 2019More news, answers and guidance for taxpayers.The 8 Most Common 2019 Tax Return Questions, Answered by ExpertsFeb. 13, 2019They’re Rich and They’re Mad About Taxes (Too Low!)Feb. 12, 2019Small Businesses Have a New Tax Break, but There Are Many ‘Ifs’Feb. 12, 2019Smaller Tax Refunds Surprise Those Expecting More ReliefFeb. 12, 2019But after I completed my return, there was a photo of a smiling C.P.A. with 19 years of experience who said I could book a video call.I tried to reach her but encountered technical glitches and gave up after three tries. Eventually, someone called me back the old-fashioned way. I put the app down and shared my laptop screen with her, another failure for the mobile experience. We discussed what expenses were kosher and she explained why we should receive a new tax break called the qualified business income deduction. In the end, I was reassured.It took a couple of tries to reach a human helper through H&R Block’s app before I finally gave up. I don’t know whether the service’s “tax pro review” would have addressed my questions — including advice that conflicted with what TurboTax told me, or why it inaccurately suggested I could deduct interest and dividends from our 529 plans. (When I later brought this to their attention, the company told me it would update its language.)If you have a relatively straightforward situation and are willing to spend at least a couple of hours trying this on your own phone, you might see how you fare. You have nothing to lose (except maybe your sanity) because you generally don’t have to pay anything until you file.As for me, I’m going to stick with my human accountant."
5c8a187149f0eacbf105cfa9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/magazine/a-dating-show-made-for-the-age-of-apps.html,"Watching the Netflix show “Dating Around” is like sitting next to a Tinder date at a bar: The possibility that something outrageous, sexy or at least interesting will happen holds your attention long after it has become clear that the people you’re spying on are just as boring as you are. The series is part of a naturalistic downshift in reality TV; it features neither overt competition nor narrative arc. It simply follows a person going on five blind dates over the course of a week, and then choosing one person to go out with again. The five dates must know they’re being judged against one another, but the show avoids acknowledging this, and the dater’s deliberations are never shown. To the extent that anyone on the show is looking for love, they’re doing so casually, nonaggressively, realistically. They’re merely game — not playing one.First dates are inherently dramatic, even when they’re dull. The atmospheric nerves — choosing an outfit, worrying you’ve said something dumb — easily create enough tension to carry a 30-minute television show. What’s most revealing about “Dating Around,” though, is the way it’s structured. The lead dater wears the same outfit and eats five different meals at the same restaurant. This allows the five dates to be edited into one four-dimensional hyperdate. Rather than showing each date in succession, episodes are organized into three segments — drinks, followed by dinner, then “after hours,” during which daters may respectfully part ways or head onward to a bar — with all the dates interwoven so they all appear to have happened in a single evening. It’s as if Ashley has body-swapped with Kate on her bathroom break, over and over and over again. All dating shows are contrived, but the contrivances on “Dating Around” are not preposterous, designed to shock or entertain — in fact, they’re depressingly familiar.A minute-long sequence in the first episode epitomizes the show’s attitude toward romance. After dinner at a Thai restaurant in Brooklyn, Luke, a motorcycle-riding real estate agent, asks Victoria, the clear front-runner among his five options, if she wants to get out of there. The scene cuts to B-roll footage of the New York City streets, and then emerging from the restaurant are our couple — Luke and now Betty, a divorced 30-year-old wearing a very short dress. Betty points at the sky as though it’s a dish she just whipped up with whatever she had in the fridge. “Look at that,” she says. Luke stops and complies. “Oh, wow,” he says, the opposite of awe-struck, his pose a lazy Vanna White, forearm raised to present to her what she’s already presented to him. “Full moon. Yeah.” He moves back to where she’s standing so they may look up at it together. “That’s beautiful,” he says. “So beautiful,” she agrees.Cut to a shot of the moon, looking like the moon. Now we hear Luke’s voice, slightly more upbeat — “This is a nice night!” — as a squeakier woman’s voice asks, “Do you see the full moon?” This voice belongs to Tiffany, a third option. They’re standing in front of the same Thai restaurant. Soon they’re making out — her initiative — and as they walk away from the restaurant holding hands, Luke expresses gratitude for the full moon. Cut back to Luke and Betty, who is calling for a “sexy dance” on the same stretch of sidewalk where he was just — or would soon be? — necking with another girl.VideoCreditCreditVideo by NetflixThe trick of the editing is not to highlight differences among the daters but to suggest that on some level they’re interchangeable. No script is necessary because they rarely deviate from how things are supposed to go. Tepid small talk about drink selection — “What is this?” “Like, a margarita” — moves on to “Where are you from?” followed by a pause for menu consideration, then onto job talk and canned flattery like “How are you single?” The blind dates eventually converge on what feel like serious topics, though the same ones come up almost every night of the week: past relationships, kids, priorities. “I just want love,” Betty says. “Connection, chemistry, love.” A minute later, Tiffany explains the importance of the “three C’s”: “compatibility, chemistry and connection.”The vocabulary — abstract nouns that fail to conjure the grand concepts they’re supposed to — recalls nothing so much as dating-app marketing, while the show’s carousel-like form reproduces the experience of using Tinder and the rest. Not only do the daters skew toward the kinds of people you commonly see on the apps — youngish, professional, fluent with an iPhone — but they’re also eager to filter their options with getting-to-know-you questionnaire material, the sort of information that you want to find out at some point but that wouldn’t necessarily come up were you to meet by chance, say, at a friend’s party.The impulse to control or strategize romance isn’t new — red flags and deal-breakers, and the analysis they inspire, abound in 1990s romantic comedies, and courtship rituals predate humanity entirely. What seems uniquely contemporary about “Dating Around” is the rote, bored way people enact these norms, as if they have no choice — or rather because they have so much of it. Regard the moon: It’s in a lot of poems. Its repeat cameo here is a way to signify romance, even where no romance was present; whether its appearance was noticed naturally by the daters or pointed out by the producers, it functions as a symbol of a symbol, inspiring the young not-lovers to go through the motions.The importance of compatibility reinforces the sense that love can be found through a formula or a checklist; the idea is as seductive as anyone on this show. When, during an “after hours” conversation, one contestant uses the word “swipe” to refer to dating itself, without having to explain the word’s provenance, she reveals that dating has become so process-oriented that it’s practically indistinguishable from the mechanisms that were meant to streamline it. Though dating apps may improve many aspects of modern romance — by making people safer and more accessible — their guardrails also seem to limit the possibilities for it. The stakeslessness of “Dating Around” might be a refreshing lack of pressure, but it might also reflect the disturbing effects of the same phenomenon in real life.Despite what tech companies would have us believe, people cannot be optimized for one another; an overwhelming abundance of options discourages the leaps of faith that can transform the terrible uncertainty of dating into something great. Nothing is especially wrong with this arrangement, but is anything right? The second episode, featuring a divorced 36-year-old woman, ends with a shot of her walking in SoHo, arms laden with shopping bags, fine with it all, catching the eyes of strangers who pass: She hasn’t called any of her dates back, but maybe one of the next five will work out. Like keeping up with a decent TV show, it’s at least something to do."
5ca5263449f0eacbf1f80b66,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/smarter-living/kick-start-your-reading-habit-with-bite-sized-books.html,"Everyone wants to read more, and over the last few months I’ve finally figured out how to fit more reading into a busy schedule. It’s surprisingly simple: Instead of trawling through Twitter or hitting up Instagram whenever I’ve had a few minutes to spare waiting for a train, I’ve been opening the Kindle app and sticking my nose in a book. Here’s the catch though: What got me started are what I call “bite-sized books”: books made up of loads of small chunks that are easy to dip in and out of, whether you have two minutes free standing in line or an hour to kill on a short-haul flight.Why bite-sized books work so well“Reading more” is one of the most common New Year’s resolutions — and a general be-a-better-human pledge but, like most resolutions, most people fail.In last year’s Goodreads Reading Challenge, more than 4.2 million people pledged to read a combined 260 million books — that’s an average of 61 books per person. Of the participants, only 16% — roughly 700,000 of them — finished their challenge. The rest flunked it.I suspect a big part of the problem is that books feel like a huge commitment. It’s much harder to motivate yourself to crack open a weighty tome crammed with characters and subplots than to just scroll through Twitter’s ephemera. You’re tired, you only have a few moments and the book probably isn’t as good as everyone says anyway. Instagram is addictive for a reason: it’s there, it’s easy and it hits your dopamine receptors harder than a Dan Brown novel.Not all books, however, are big commitments. That’s why bite-sized books are a great way to kick-start your reading. One great example of a bite-sized book is Tim Ferriss’ “Tribe of Mentors.” In the book, Mr. Ferriss interviews over 130 of the “world’s top performers,” from people like Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post, to Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of video game publisher Take-Two Interactive. The hook is that he asks every interviewee the same set of ten questions. Each interview is only a few pages long so they take minutes to read.Over my first few days of reading “Tribe of Mentors,” I found that instead of opening Twitter, Instagram or Facebook when I had time to waste, I opened the Kindle app on my iPhone instead and read an interview. If I just had two minutes, I might only get through three or four questions, but because each one was a complete answer, it didn’t feel like I was constantly being pulled away from some important bit of action.For the first time in a long time, reading a book on my phone was just as convenient — and far more interesting — than social media.All Those Books You’ve Bought but Haven’t Read? There’s a Word for ThatOct. 8, 2018Instagram Now Home to Classic Feminist LiteratureOct. 5, 2018What makes a good bite-sized book?Not all books work when they’re read in small snippets. “A Game of Thrones” just won’t make a lot of sense if you dip in and out too much — not that it makes a huge amount of sense without a reference encyclopedia anyway.Certain genres of books, on the other hand, work really well. I’ve found essay collections, travel guides and short stories to be the best for me.Collections of essays or, even better, columns are a great place to start. Essays tend to be short and totally independent of each other — at most they’re linked by a common theme. While there are often one or two essays in a collection that take an hour or so to read, you can save it for when you’ve got a little more time to kill and just chip away at the shorter ones when you’re at the bus stop.If you already have a favorite columnist, see if they’ve published a collection — many prolific ones do. Otherwise, I can wholeheartedly recommend Tim Kreider’s two collections, “We Learn Nothing” and “I Wrote This Book Because I Love You;” “Consider the Lobster and Other Essays” by David Foster Wallace; “How Did You Get This Number” by Sloane Crosley; “Arguably” by Christopher Hitchens; and “A Slip of the Keyboard” by Terry Pratchett (and dozens more if you reach out to me on Twitter!)Good travel guides are also perfect bite-sized books. I’m a big fan of Lonely Planet’s trip guides like “Epic Drives of the World,” “Epic Hikes of the World” and “Epic Bike Rides of the World.” Each one is packed with awesome adventure ideas — a perfect distraction on your morning commute. Or, if you already have a vacation planned, grab a good guidebook for your destination and work your way through it. Not only will you be reading more, but your trip will be even better thanks to all the preparation.If your tastes skew more toward fiction, consider short stories. While there aren’t many modern writers who do more than dabble with the form, lots of the greats of the last century wrote a ridiculous number. For example, Ernest Hemingway wrote about 60 while Arthur C. Clarke published more than 100. “The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway” and “The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke” collect most of each author’s work in one affordable — if hard to carry — book.Even some thrillers can work. There are writers like Dan Brown — “The Da Vinci Code” — and Matthew Reilly — “Ice Station” — who seem incapable of writing more than a thousand words in one go without needing to break it into a new chapter. It gives their books serious pace, but it also means that you get a natural stopping point every few minutes — if you can bear to tear yourself away.How to make bite-sized books work for youReally, bite-sized books are what you make of them. I started out with a collection of interviews, gradually moved on to essays and short stories and finally, once I was in the habit of reading any time I had a few minutes to spare, straight-up fiction. Since I use the Kindle app on my phone, I don’t even have to think about carrying a book with me.You, however, should do whatever you think will work well for you. Pick a book you reckon you’ll be able to read in a few snatched moments every day, grab a cheap paperback or a copy of the ebook and get stuck in. Before you know it, you’ll have a few titles under your belt, and you’ll have conquered that “read more” challenge you set for yourself at the beginning of the year.How to Tap Your Inner ReaderJan. 31, 2019"
5ca50d2d49f0eacbf1f80aef,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/senate-republicans-nuclear-option.html,"WASHINGTON — The “cooling saucer” of the United States Senate keeps going into the microwave.For the third time in six years, the majority party in the Senate detonated the so-called nuclear option on Wednesday to unilaterally change years-old rules of the chamber with a simple-majority vote. This time, to work through a backlog of President Trump’s judicial and administration nominations, Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive-branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two.The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties. Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B. Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr. Trump’s nominees.“There’s no other word but ‘hypocrisy,’” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, justified his actions on the Garland nomination, saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee. And he said Democrats started the process in 2003, when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president’s nominees.Mr. McConnell’s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub-cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr. Trump, who has been badgering him to take such a step for months.“We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate, but their base will roast them alive if they supported” a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees, said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who is a close ally of Mr. McConnell.But the one-party rule change — which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60-vote threshold for most judges and executive-branch nominees, and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees — knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority-rule House. And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate, the 60-vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation.“The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell’s influence,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the upper chamber. “He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended. We have walked away from amending, debating and legislating.”Mr. Schumer declared it “a very sad day for the Senate.”Mr. McConnell answered, “This is not a sad day; this is a glad day.”“We know you don’t like Donald Trump, but he won an election and he is entitled” to “set up” his government, he continued.Under the new rules, the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce. It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.Wednesday’s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move, made when Democrats controlled the chamber, to abolish the 60-vote threshold on most nominees. Nor was it as provocative as 2017, when the Republican majority extended that 51-vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr. McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland’s nomination.But Wednesday’s precedent opens the way for Mr. McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub-cabinet-level posts and Federal District Court judges, appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees. Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation, the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees.Senate Democrats — who have been marginalized by Mr. McConnell’s hardball style of leadership — said Wednesday’s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate.For Mr. Trump, the change is long overdue. For more than a year the White House, spurred on by Mr. Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, has prodded Mr. McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a “mini” nuclear option.But Mr. McConnell resisted, in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans, Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart. Mr. Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans’ weekly lunch in the Capitol last week.“This is crazy,” he said, according to two people in the room. “We have all these people, ambassadors, who have put their whole lives on hold” waiting to be confirmed.A day later, Mr. McConnell, speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference, blasted Mr. Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party.He singled out Mr. Schumer’s own former spokesman, Brian Fallon, who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges.“Chuck won’t make a deal because he’s afraid of Brian Fallon,” Mr. McConnell said, according to a person familiar with his remarks.Mr. Fallon did not respond to a request for comment.“The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell, because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules,” said Justin Goodman, Mr. Schumer’s current spokesman.Mr. Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr. McConnell, particularly the majority leader’s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments. In a recent leadership meeting, Mr. Schumer complained that Mr. McConnell was offering him a deal that “chopped off four fingers” as opposed to cutting off his whole hand, Senate Democratic aides said.Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday. Two Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Ms. Collins, also opposed it.“The Senate’s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities, minorities and individual senators,” Mr. Lee said.The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule, and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr. Altman.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer, who bear no great affection for each other, engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor — holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who, in near unison, deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch.At one point, Mr. Schumer, speaking from a prepared text, turned to confront Mr. McConnell directly, accusing the leader of abusing “the brute power of the majority” to push the change.“I’m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell’s debasement of the Senate,” he said.Mr. McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr. Schumer spoke. He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs, wearing a wry, mocking grin.When he stood to defend himself, his face betrayed the strain, gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw, as he accused Democrats, under the leadership of “a fella named Chuck Schumer,” for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years.“He started the whole thing!” Mr. McConnell said, turning to face Mr. Schumer."

This week, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, tempered expectations, telling The Wall Street Journal that market turbulence was not likely to affect the company’s plans, but “if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.”Uber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year, he added.The shutdown, volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment. The start-up world’s success hinges, in part, on its ability to use hype and “trust me” confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future. It’s easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation, disruption and rising valuations (and ignore the lack of profits).But not everyone has, and skeptics are getting louder. Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capital investor, recently called the entire start-up and venture capital system a “charade” and “an enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi scheme.”He’s right in one sense: A Ponzi scheme relies on its creator’s ability to persuade ever-larger crowds to buy into his or her vision. Same goes for start-ups that haven’t proved they’re able to turn a profit. A flash of doubt, especially among public-market investors, could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire start-up ecosystem.For the largest, most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public, there could not be a worse moment for that to happen. If Uber can’t go public, what does it mean for all the “Uber for X” companies that followed its lead?Cracks are beginning to show. This week, two high-flying start-ups experienced a reality check in their fund-raising. WeWork sought to raise $16 billion in new funding from SoftBank, its main backer. The company wound up raising just $2 billion — still an enormous pile of cash, but a steep step down from its original plan.And Bird, a two-year-old scooter company that was so sought-after by investors last summer that they doubled the company’s valuation in just a few weeks, is now raising funding at a flat valuation, according to Axios.Some venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn, as I wrote this week. They’re hoarding cash and making “downturn lists” of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable. And some companies have seen the venture-fueled madness and decided it’s not for them.Elsewhere this week:■ Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy. No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy, with concerns spreading to non-tech companies including Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany, Matt Phillips writes.■ Apple’s biggest issue is not the Chinese economy, it’s that people like the columnist Kevin Roose’s mother don’t feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore.■ That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies, including Vizio, Samsung, Sony and LG, to use its software. The deals — something the company has resisted in the past — show Apple’s ambition to make more money from content and services, as sales of its cash cow, the iPhone, slow down, Brian X. Chen writes.■ When the government asked Palantir and Oracle to share the number of women and minorities it employs, the companies tried to hide the numbers, citing them as “trade secrets.” According to a report from Reveal News, the numbers are abysmal. (Palantir has no female executives and just one female manager.) The publication sued to obtain the letters the companies sent justifying their privacy around the issue. The Palantir letter cited fears that competitors would steal their lone female manager."
5c5c5f393a125f5075c08864,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/high-flying-bird-review.html,"On a basketball court, “give me the rock” means “pass the ball.” In “High Flying Bird,” an exhilarating and argumentative caper concerning a sports agent, his N.B.A.-rookie client and other interested parties, the phrase takes on a slightly different connotation — something akin to “the workers should seize control of the means of production.”Notwithstanding the presence of three real-life professional ballers (Reggie Jackson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Donovan Mitchell) giving straight-to-camera testimony about life in the league, this isn’t a sports movie in any conventional sense. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Tarell Alvin McCraney, it uses the charisma of athletes and the competitive energy of the game they play to catalyze a feisty, twisty fable of labor and capital in the 21st century.McCraney, a formidable playwright (his “Choir Boy” is currently on Broadway) and an Oscar winner for “Moonlight,” has composed a densely layered, intellectually demanding agitprop drama that draws on rabble-rousing theatrical traditions (Clifford Odets, Dario Fo) while fixing its gaze squarely on the injustices and absurdities of the present. Soderbergh, shooting almost entirely with an iPhone, conducts a brisk tour of the streets and suites of money-mad Manhattan, with excursions to Philadelphia and the South Bronx.It’s very much worth digging into the political economy of the movie, but more important, at the outset, is to pay tribute to its craft and ingenuity. McCraney’s script is quite simply an extraordinary piece of writing, idiomatic and poetic in its cadences and pleasingly serpentine in its structure. The challenge for Soderbergh and the more-than-game cast is to turn the artful verbiage into persuasive human speech and the plot machinery into a plausible slice of organic reality. Which it is, helping down the medicine of topicality with the sugar of pop-culture cleverness in the most delightful way.The slightly distended frames and peculiar angles of the pocket-size camera — and the way Soderbergh, serving as the director of photography under his usual pseudonym, Peter Andrews, makes it twirl, glide and shimmy — create an atmosphere of buoyancy and immediacy. The actors take it from there, above all André Holland, an executive producer of the film and the third member of its central creative team.Holland (a vital part of both “Moonlight” and “The Knick,” Soderbergh’s Cinemax series) plays Ray Burke, an agent who finds himself in a tight professional and ethical spot. The team owners have locked out the players (as happened in the N.B.A. back in 2011), and the money that keeps everybody afloat is quickly drying up.ImageAndré Holland, an executive producer of the film, plays a sports agent who finds himself in a tight professional and ethical spot.CreditPeter Andrews/NetflixIn the first scene, Ray is lecturing his client Erick Scott (Melvin Gregg), a recent No. 1 draft pick whose professional debut has been postponed, about financial responsibility and personal discipline. It’s a big-brotherly scolding and a pep talk, but also the beginnings of a ruthless critique of the way the system works, exploiting naïve and ambitious young men like Erick even as it promises them fame and fortune.That idea — that in spite of high salaries and endorsement deals, athletes are fundamentally workers, generating profits for the owning class — is refined and complicated as Ray pinballs from one meeting to the next. He checks in at the office with his boss (Zachary Quinto), engages in energetic screwball banter with his erstwhile assistant, Samantha (Zazie Beetz) and argues dialectics and family-leave policy with Myra (Sonja Sohn), the head of the player’s association.Other encounters — with a no-nonsense sports mom (Jeryl Prescott), the owner of Erick’s team (Kyle MacLachlan) and Ray’s old friend Spence (Bill Duke), who runs a youth basketball program — follow the same didactic, disputatious pattern. There’s a fair amount of soliloquizing and rhetorical grandstanding, which is also true of Shakespeare, hip-hop and church. If you like any of those, you might enjoy this too.In the course of all the back-and-forthing, a scheme emerges that strikes Ray as wonderfully simple and potentially revolutionary. What if the players, paralyzed by the intransigence of their employers, could eliminate those middlemen and take control of the fruits of their own talents? It’s a question that resonates beyond the court, the locker room and the broadcast booth, into the worlds of art and entertainment. The racial aspects of the power dynamic that governs organized sports is so obvious that it almost goes without saying. Whenever anyone does say it — when, that is, somebody invokes slavery as a metaphor for current circumstances — Spence demands the recitation of a short prayer: “I love the lord and all his black people.” If there is resignation in those words, there is defiance too.“High Flying Bird” swoops and cuts through the contradictions of modern culture with the fleet momentum of a power forward destroying a flat-footed defense on his way to the hoop. You don’t quite understand what just happened until the next thing is already happening. The intellectual virtuosity on display is somehow both ostentatious and casual. The performances — Holland’s in particular, full of sadness, guile and audacity — feel the same way.Not everything works. A back story having to do with Ray’s cousin, a basketball prodigy who met a tragic end, feels like the kind of baggage more suited to the stage than the screen. At moments the busyness of the plot overshadows the wit of the performances. But the occasional raggedness of the movie only enhances the credibility of its ambitions. Like Ray Burke, it’s in a big hurry and has a lot on its mind.And it leaves you with a lot to think about, in addition to race, class and basketball: what it means to love your work, and why it matters to be paid for it; how utopian visions and tactical calculations work together to create the possibility of change; why we take fun so seriously. It ends not with a big game or a high-stakes showdown but with a protest anthem — by Richie Havens, who also performed the song that gives the film its name — and a recommendation for further reading. Which I am not about to spoil."

Like many protagonists of timeless stories, Ajijaak is young, alone and facing an arduous journey. But she’s also unusual: She isn’t human. A whooping crane who has been separated from her parents by a forest fire, Ajijaak (pronounced Ah-JEE-jock) must make her first migration from the north to the south of Turtle Island — North America — with only a medicine bundle (a collection of sacred objects) to guide her. Presented by IBEX Puppetry and based on storyboards created by Heather Henson, one of Jim Henson’s daughters, this production uses puppets, video projections, kites and indigenous song and dance to relate a Native American fable about the interdependence of all life. Ty Defoe, who wrote the show and collaborated on its original music with Dawn Avery, Kevin Tarrant and Larry Mitchell, works with Henson to illuminate not only ancient mythology but also contemporary environmental concerns. The whooping crane is an endangered species, and Ajijaak has to find her way in an increasingly dangerous world. 646-223-3010, newvictory.org‘ALICE IN WONDERLAND’ at the Town School (March 2, 2 and 4 p.m.). In this lively dance-theater production, the Victorian Alice goes down the rabbit hole to a Wonderland that is even weirder than the one Lewis Carroll conjured: contemporary New York City. Presented by Spark Movement Collective, this version of the story introduces her to bustling tourists, the subway, a flood of iPhones and, instead of the Mad Hatter’s party, a bunch of tea-drinking street vendors. According to the company’s website, the show illustrates that normality is relative, something New Yorkers can easily agree with.sparkmovementcollective.org‘CIRCUS INCOGNITUS’ at the Leon M. Goldstein Performing Arts Center (March 2, 2 p.m.). Most performers would prefer that audiences not hurl objects at them, but Jamie Adkins doesn’t just accept this, he actively encourages it. In this case, the missiles are lemons, which Adkins expects spectators to toss so he can catch them — on a fork clenched between his teeth. That’s not the only feat that he offers in this solo show, presented by the Brooklyn theater series On Stage at Kingsborough. Portraying a hapless, Chaplinesque sort of character, he also copes with a ladder that falls apart (while he’s on it), a problematic slack wire and multiple props to juggle (in all senses of the verb).718-368-5596, onstageatkingsborough.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]FIRST SATURDAYS FOR FAMILIES: INTERTWINED FORMS at the New Museum (March 2, 10 a.m.-noon). What can you do with scraps? Quite a bit, if you’re an artist. Witness the work of Jeffrey Gibson, whose show at the New Museum, “The Anthropophagic Effect,” incorporates references to contemporary painting and pattern while also paying homage to the woven work Native Americans have made from materials like river cane and porcupine quills. In this free program for ages 4 to 12 — space is first come first served — children will investigate the clothing and helmets Gibson has created, which draw on his Choctaw and Cherokee heritage, and then use components like paper, pipe cleaners, fabric strips, yarn and branches to make their own designs and baskets.212-219-1222, newmuseum.orgHERSTORY DAY at the Museum of the City of New York (March 3, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.). This event isn’t just about “herstory”; it’s also about your story. An intergenerational tribute to Women’s History Month, the program will include book-making and poetry-writing drop-in workshops, as well as a pop-up installation of the Free Black Women’s Library, a collection of books written by black women. Ola Ronke Akinmowo, the library’s founder, will talk about her work at 11:15 a.m. Starting at noon, families can use yarn and ribbon to bind together information sheets about women represented in the museum’s shows and collection and then go on a scavenger hunt to find those figures in the galleries. They can also write verse about these women’s experiences as well as their own.212-534-1672, mcny.org‘THE SOUND OF MUSIC’ at Nitehawk Prospect Park (March 2-3, 10 a.m.). Yes, the hills are alive, and this corner of Brooklyn, too, as Nitehawk Cinema brings an old-fashioned classic to the screen. Robert Wise’s 1965 film has no computer-generated imagery or special effects — just a great Rodgers and Hammerstein score, an utterly wholesome story and Julie Andrews’s luminous performance as Maria, the young governess to the von Trapp family. Tell your kids that it won five Academy Awards, including best picture. And since Nitehawk serves real food, you can also have brunch at the movies.nitehawkcinema.com/prospectparkTILT KIDS FESTIVAL at various locations (March 2-31). Creativity sometimes calls for upending tradition, which you will certainly see at this aptly named event. Presented by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the French Institute Alliance Française, Tilt flouts convention as it exposes young minds to cutting-edge international performances. This year’s festival kicks off this weekend with celebrations of gender fluidity, including a drag queen story hour and Johanny Bert and Magali Mougel’s “She No Princess, He No Hero,” a play whose central characters, Leïli and Nils, aren’t interested in adopting typical masculine and feminine roles. It also offers Olivier Py’s “The Young Girl, the Devil and the Mill,” a theater piece based on the Grimm fairy tale “The Girl Without Hands.” Involving a bargain with Satan and its horrifying consequences, the original story is not the type you’ll find Disney adapting. But Py has made it into a musical about the steadfast heroine’s adventure. (A full schedule is on the website.)tiltkidsfestival.org"
5c8f5e7949f0eacbf105d9ec,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/science/cubesats-marco-mars.html,"Last year, two satellites the size of cereal boxes sped toward Mars as though they were on an invisible track in space. Officially called MarCO A and MarCO B, they were nicknamed Wall-E and EVE, after the animated robots from the Pixar movie, by engineers at NASA.They were just as endearing and vulnerable as their namesakes. The satellites, known as cubesats, were sent to watch over NASA’s larger InSight spacecraft as it attempted a perilous landing on the surface of Mars at the end of November.Constellations of small satellites like the MarCOs now orbit Earth, used by scientists, private companies, high school students and even governments seeking low-budget eyes in the skies. But never before had a cubesat traveled 300 million miles into space.On Nov. 26, as the InSight lander touched down, its status was swiftly relayed back to Earth by the two trailing cubesats. The operation was a success, and the performance of the MarCO satellites may change the way missions operate, enabling cubesats to become deep space travelers in their own right.NASA engineers weren’t sure what to expect when the MarCO mission launched last May. “I think it’s opened up so many doors and kind of shattered expectations,” said Anne Marinan, a systems engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “The fact that we actually got as far as we did with both satellites working was huge.” About a month after dropping InSight onto Mars, NASA lost contact with the MarCOs. The agency may attempt to wake them up someday, but for now Wall-E and EVE are silently roaming the solar system, proof of a new space exploration technology that almost never got to the launchpad.[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]Uncanceling the cubesat programThe MarCO mission was canceled repeatedly. After all, the primary goal of NASA’s InSight mission was to land a stationary spacecraft on Mars and listen for marsquakes, giving scientists an improved picture of the red planet’s internal makeup. And multiple spacecraft orbiting Mars already relay information from its surface back to Earth. The cubesats wouldn’t play a direct role in InSight’s success or failure, so it was a challenge to persuade NASA to support a nonessential program using unproven technology. The MarCO team fought hard, prevailing at last with the argument that at a cost of only $18 million, the idea was worth taking a chance on. If these two tiny satellites worked well, it would not only mean that similar spacecraft could support big planetary missions in the future, but also that cubesats might carry instruments of their own. Proving the technology’s reach could stretch NASA’s funding, the engineers said, while creating opportunities for wider exploration of the solar system.As InSight safely touched down on Mars, the MarCOs were zipping past the planet, collecting readings from the landing and relaying them home more swiftly than the satellites currently orbiting Mars could.“We had some astonishing statistics,” said John Baker, manager of the SmallSat program at J.P.L. “We ended up getting 97 percent of all the InSight data back. And that’s because we had two small spacecraft at exactly the right position over the planet to receive the signals.”ImageA picture taken by the InSight lander on Mars’s surface in December.CreditNASA, via Associated PressImageMars, seen by the MarCO B cubesat, about 4,700 miles from the planet in November.CreditAgence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageFrom left, John Baker, Anne Marinan and Andrew Klesh, engineers who led the MarCO mission at J.P.L.CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesHaving custom cubesats overhead meant that NASA did not need to use other Martian satellites or worry about their alignment at the time of landing. If future missions tow along their own MarCOs, teams back on Earth may always know how their spacecraft are doing.The creativity of their design contributed to the cubesats’ success. Before they began constructing the MarCOs, the team made 3D models and used yarn to plan how best to run the guts and wiring inside. The MacGyver-like improvisation resulted in part from the program’s low budget.The cubesats run on solar power, and their propellant is fire extinguisher fluid. Lining the front of both spacecraft are eight pen-width nozzles that spray cold gas. The cameras onboard are off-the-shelf, and the radio is similar to that in an iPhone.But it wasn’t all easy. On their six-month journey to Mars, both cubesats occasionally lost contact with Earth. A couple of months after launch, MarCO B sprang a fuel leak and started spinning out of control. The team thought they’d lost it.“Management is slowly encroaching upon the room,” said Andrew Klesh, MarCO’s chief engineer, describing the scene. “We started to look at all the data. We broke apart the problem, and within about 24 hours we had MarCO B back under control.”Just a day before landing, MarCO B stopped communicating with Earth again. The cubesat came back online just in time. The InSight probe moved into the Martian landing phase that NASA officials know as “seven minutes of terror,” and both spacecraft spoke to Earth the entire time.The future is getting smallerImageConsoles at mission control at J.P.L. CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesWhile inexpensive cubesats like the MarCOs may serve as real-time communication relays for future deep-space missions, NASA has more adventurous goals in mind, some of which were hinted at in last week’s budget proposals by the Trump administration.“When we have big spacecraft, you don’t want to necessarily take it into a very risky situation,” said Mr. Baker. “But you can take an inexpensive probe and send it down to search or to get up close to something and examine it.”Mr. Baker and others at J.P.L. are currently working on planetary cubesat missions. One proposal, nicknamed Cupid’s Arrow, envisions using the spacecraft to study the opaque atmosphere of Venus.In other proposals, the next iteration of interplanetary cubesats would be scouts deployed by larger spacecraft studying worlds that could be hospitable to life. They could be sent into the plumes of Enceladus, Saturn’s icy moon, which ejects water vapor into space. Or cubesats could descend toward the surface of Europa, the ocean moon of Jupiter.“These spacecraft will allow us to act as the Star Trek probes to go down to the surface of challenging worlds where we might not be able to take the risk of a much larger mission,” said Dr. Klesh.When NASA’s next-generation rocket, the Space Launch System, heads for its first practice orbit around the moon (a launch which is facing delays), it will carry 13 cubesats, some as tests of technology and others as science experiments. One cubesat, for example, will be tasked with mapping sources of water on the moon for future human exploration. Another, called NEA Scout, is being designed by Dr. Marinan to monitor nearby asteroids that could pose potential hazards to our planet.Private companies are working on shrinking scientific instruments to be placed aboard the next generation of Earth-orbiting satellites. And as instruments become smaller, the options for singular scientific missions in deep space become greater, as does the potential for whole fleets of MarCO-like satellites.Image""Lucky peanuts,"" with homemade MarCO branding, at J.P.L.CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesToughening tiny travelersBut much work remains before more cubesats can travel beyond the moon. The challenges that come with operating full-size planetary missions apply to small satellites, too.If you want to go to the Jovian system, you need heavy radiation shielding. If you want to go to Saturn, you need more efficient solar panels and ways to keep the tiny spacecraft warm.“We think we can actually send a small spacecraft all the way to Jupiter,” said Dr. Baker. “The problem is, I have to come up with a way of automating the onboard spacecraft so that it can fly itself to Jupiter or you only have to talk to it once a month. Or we create a way for it to only radio home when it needs help.”These are the kinds of engineering challenges the MarCO team worked to overcome with the journey to Mars.“It’s really opened a door of possibilities now that we have shown that this has actually worked,” Dr. Marinan said. “It’s not an impossible concept anymore”The engineers even managed to get around one of the trickier issues with how to collect data and talk to the cubesats. Typically, when a spacecraft calls home, it will spend several hours using NASA’s Deep Space Network, the very expensive phone system for calls beyond the moon. But these long-distance conversations weren’t an option for the MarCOs. So the team at J.P.L. created new ways of monitoring the spacecraft that allowed them to collect in a one-hour period the data that would usually take eight hours.“MarCO is a herald of new things to come,” said Dr. Klesh. “Not necessarily better things, but different, and a new way of space exploration that will complement all the larger missions that we do.”As it passed Mars, MarCO B returned the first photo ever taken of Mars from a cubesat. It revealed the copper-colored entirety of the planet in the dark of space, and a small section of the spacecraft’s antenna. The angle of the photo was intentional — not only to show where we’ve been, but a hint at where these tiny wanderers could go next.ImageA visitor snaps a picture of a cubesat at J.P.L.CreditMarcio Jose Sanchez/Associated PressEarlier reporting on the miniaturization of spaceflightIt’s a Briefcase!

5c2eb6153a125f5075c02c4d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/business/auto-sales.html,"As they recorded another year of strong United States sales, automakers said Thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead. But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts.Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded.But last year’s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers — considered a more accurate measure of demand — were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider.At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds.Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration’s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won’t have that tailwind again.“This year is going to be tougher than last year,” said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, “and the next year will even tougher than 2019.”Even though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly.“Other than that one segment, there isn’t a lot of growth,” he said.In addition, Tesla’s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.’s domestic market share fell to 17 percent — its lowest level since the company’s infancy a century ago.Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford’s sales fell 9 percent in December.Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there.Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there.Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday.Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. “It’s certainly something we look at, as a global company,” Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford’s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, “I think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.”She added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence.Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve — and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers.“Interest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,” Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota’s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. “But it hasn’t slowed the industry to a point of concern.”Still, Ford and G.M. are preparing for more difficult times. Both companies are cutting jobs and costs in North America. G.M. said in November that it was idling five North American plants and aiming to eliminate more than 14,000 blue- and white-collar jobs.Earlier in 2018, Ford announced a plan to reorganize its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move is expected to eliminate several thousand jobs.General Motors began the year with an executive appointment, naming Mark Reuss on Thursday as its resident. Mr. Reuss, the son of a former G.M. president, Lloyd Reuss, has been serving as the company’s product development chief. He succeeds Dan Ammann, who was named chief executive of G.M. Cruise, a division developing self-driving cars.One thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices — at about half their level five years ago — have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low."
5c521dc03a125f5075c0730c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/amazon-walmart-flipkart-india.html,"NEW DELHI — On Friday, Indian consumers will wake up to an emptier, more expensive version of Amazon’s shopping service.Gone will be iPhones and cheap jumbo packs of Pampers diapers. Fewer varieties of Maybelline cosmetics will be available, and Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers will vanish entirely.In all, more than 400,000 items that account for nearly a third of Amazon’s estimated $6 billion in annual sales in India will probably disappear at least temporarily from the local version of the company’s service, as Amazon tries to comply with new e-commerce rules imposed by the Indian government.Amazon, which had structured its operations carefully to adhere to  a 2016 revision to the country’s e-commerce rules, said it had asked the Indian government to clarify the new policy and give it an additional four months to comply. “We remain committed to be compliant to all local laws, rules and regulations,” Amazon said in a statement.Barring a last-minute reprieve, Amazon’s leading rival in India, Flipkart, which effectively became a Walmart subsidiary last year, will also be forced to remove thousands of products from its service, particularly in the apparel category, where it sells many clothing items made by affiliated companies. Flipkart could lose as much as a quarter of its sales in the short term, according to Technopak, an Indian consulting firm.A spokesman for Walmart, which spent $16 billion for its controlling stake in Flipkart, declined to comment on the new policy or its potential effects.The change underscores the risks American companies face in India, which ranked No. 77 globally in the World Bank’s most recent survey on ease of doing business.With 1.3 billion residents, the country would appear to be an attractive market. But it poses many challenges, including bad roads, low per-capita incomes, a cacophony of languages, and a consumer economy that runs largely on cash.The country’s millions of shopkeepers and small traders wield tremendous power in votes and campaign donations. And its large corporations, many of them closely tied to the government, are eager to wrest Indian consumers from the embrace of foreign companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google.Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to Silicon Valley in 2015 to urge tech companies to invest in India.But with national elections looming in May and growing disenchantment with Mr. Modi’s policies, his government has recently championed a vigorous economic nationalism, passing or proposing policies to rein in the power of foreign financial firms like Visa and Mastercard and tech companies like Facebook and Google.Just after Christmas, it was the retailers’ turn. Mr. Modi’s administration announced that, effective Feb. 1, foreign-owned e-commerce services like Amazon and Flipkart could not sell goods through affiliated companies. Direct sales to consumers had been banned earlier, but each of the two companies had set up a complex array of related companies to indirectly offer popular products at low prices with fast delivery.To continue operating, Amazon and Walmart will now have to turn their sites in India into digital bazaars for independent merchants, becoming more like eBay, which charges for certain services but sells nothing itself.“People have started to buy China’s viewpoint: We need to build domestic assets and domestic companies,” said Ankur Bisen, an analyst who leads the retail division at Technopak. “We have to have a more nuanced approach to the onslaught of global corporations.”Ashwani Mahajan, a leader of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an economic self-reliance organization affiliated with Mr. Modi’s political party, praised the new policy, saying it was essential to help small shopkeepers survive against the economic might of global companies that can afford to offer deep discounts.“I know my next-door shopkeeper,” Mr. Mahajan said, echoing arguments heard in the United States when Walmart was battling Main Street retailers. “I know his family. I don’t know who is Amazon, who is Flipkart. For the survival of these two entities, I can’t put the livelihood of my country at risk.”Snapdeal, an Indian online marketplace that was hurt by earlier price wars with Amazon and Flipkart, also cheered the policy changes while urging the government not to grant the companies more time to comply.Indian consumers may pay a price for such protectionism. A survey of common products currently available on Amazon’s Indian site suggests that after sales by its affiliated companies are banned, many products will disappear and others will become more expensive because they will only be sold by small merchants who lack the clout to negotiate low wholesale prices from manufacturers.The policy changes prompted complaints from American business groups and diplomats, but the government has shown no sign of relenting.Senior officials of the commerce ministry, which issued the new rules, did not respond to several requests for comment. In recent days, they have been bombarded with thousands of emails and, in some cases, videos from small merchants urging them to take a tough line with the foreign companies.In a letter sent on Wednesday, the main traders’ organization threatened the government with political repercussions if it backtracked on the policy and urged officials to investigate the past two years’ of transactions made by Amazon and Flipkart.Mr. Bisen of Technopak predicted that the government would not enforce the rules aggressively for a few months, giving Amazon and Walmart time to figure out how to work within the new system. Instead of selling products, he said, they could charge fees for listing items, storing goods and delivering them.“This entire arrangement will force these guys to be service providers,” Mr. Bisen said."
5c39c8b43a125f5075c040ef,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html,"To be famous in 2019 one must possess (in addition to talent, or at least popularity) a patina of authenticity and a willingness to admit wrongdoing. Also: an iPhone. Lady Gaga makes for a perfect case study. On Thursday, she sent an apologetic message to her more than 77 million Twitter followers. The singer wanted to let her Little Monsters know that, after renewed criticism of R. Kelly, she had decided to pull a track she had recorded with him in 2013 from streaming music services. “I’m sorry,” she wrote, her words cast against a grayish faux-paper background familiar to Apple users and celebrity news consumers, “both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner. I love you.”I stand by anyone who has ever been the victim of sexual assault: pic.twitter.com/67sz4WpV3i— Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) January 10, 2019
Her statement was written using Notes, a free app that is preloaded onto Apple devices for the purpose of storing personal memories and to-do lists. In recent years, though, it has become the medium of choice for celebrity mass communication. The reasons for writing these Notes notes vary, but oftentimes they are mea culpas for public errors. Armie Hammer apologized with a Notes app note for criticizing his peers for posting grief selfies after Stan Lee’s death (“I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart and will be working on my Twitter impulse control”). Kendall Jenner apologized for her clothing line’s insensitive use of the Notorious B.I.G.’s and Tupac Shakur’s likenesses (“we are huge fans of their music”). Logan Paul apologized for videotaping a dead body in Japan (“I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention”). Cardi B notably did not apologize for secretly marrying Offset (“at least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock”). Ariana Grande once apologized for licking a doughnut (“I will strive to be better”).Other public figures who have used Notes to make statements include Taylor Swift, Lena Dunham, Drake, Pete Davidson and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Part of the medium’s appeal is the ease with which its contents may be shared. Notes app apologies are screenshotted and dispersed, first on Twitter and Instagram, and then in entertainment news reporting. They are embedded into tabloid websites and quoted by magazines, as polished statements coming directly from publicists might be.Zara Rahim, who handled publicity for Vogue before joining The Wing, a women’s co-working space, as its communications director, said that the efficacy of these statements lies not only in their speed but also their appearance. “I can just write this quick note on my Notes app, because it looks like I did it on my phone, have my publicist take a quick glance at it, if I’m smart,” she said, “and then post it directly on my Instagram.”Sometimes statements include grammatical and spelling errors, or profanity, which function (perhaps unwittingly) as rhetorical devices, making the authors seem not only unpretentious but fallibly human. Their notes also frequently employ clichés of spoken apologies: “from the bottom of my heart,” “profoundly,” “I wish I knew then what I know now,” and so on. These tics foster the false sense of intimacy that most social media encourages. Of course, the marks of a direct-from-the source apology may come across as simply impulsive or careless. “The worst Notes app apologies are the ones that clearly were being written stream of consciousness and didn’t get the edit, that were way, way, way too reactive to the point of where there are misspellings,” Allison P. Davis, a pop culture reporter for New York Magazine, said.There are also signs of possible fraudulence. After Taylor Swift said, in a Notes app statement directed at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, that she would “very much like to be excluded from this narrative,” people seized on a minute detail of her shared screenshot: the “search” icon in the upper left corner. Its presence suggested that the published note was one of many drafts she had carefully constructed with professional help, thus undercutting her attempt to appear off-the-cuff.The best Notes app statements follow the same guiding principles of any good apology: get in and get out; be direct; don’t try too hard to defend yourself; and (this is a bonus!) maybe say what you’re doing moving forward. “Folks are more likely to give you a second shot if you are just willing to say you made a mistake, and that you are going to do better,” Ms. Rahim said.The brevity of social media pushes most people toward a short and sweet statement. But when 280 characters doesn’t quite cut it, Notes app, or whatever text keeper Androids come with, does the trick. (Jeff Bezos, who has been known to use BlackBerry and Samsung phones, released a divorce announcement this week that appeared to be formatted by a newspaper typesetter.) Sharing a Notes app apology does have its pitfalls. If fans suspect an apology isn’t as heartfelt or genuine as its straight-from-my-personal-device format implies, the entire thing could backfire. But even worse is a completely unapologetic apology. After the music-retreat-for-one-percenters known as Fyre Festival proved to be a scam, Ja Rule, its co-organizer, made sure to relinquish himself of blame: “I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT.” “You want to avoid the Notes app spiral, long and short,” Ms. Rahim said, referring to the age-old tendency to get defensive, blowing out what should be a simple “sorry” into a long and winding tale of excuses.If it seems like the trick to crafting a good Notes app apology isn’t too different from the trick to crafting a regular old apology, that’s because — surprise! — they’re one and the same. A Notes app apology is just written in fear of (or, perhaps, in service of) going viral."
5caf577949f0eacbf1f82d11,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/red-carpet-premiere-live-stream.html,"At the “Captain Marvel” premiere in Los Angeles last month, Brie Larson roamed the red carpet in a sequined Rodarte slip dress, a galaxy of diamonds cradling her ears. A squadron of F-16 fighter jets flew overhead as fans cheered the movie’s star as she climbed steps to a stage where she was interviewed by Lorraine Cink.Ms. Cink, a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host, did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown as others did that day. Nor did she discuss the movie’s internet trolls or Ms. Larson’s call for more diversity in Hollywood. Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers, a United States Air Force pilot, played by Ms. Larson.“Carol changed my life and this movie hasn’t even come out yet,” Ms. Larson said, as she held back tears.ImageThe “Captain Marvel” stars Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson at the movie’s premiere in Los Angeles last month.CreditMario Anzuoni/ReutersRed carpet interviews from the premiere were streamed live for fans who could not attend. And the show was as slickly produced as any pre-awards festivities, albeit one that edged toward camp at times. (For starters, Ms. Cink’s co-host interviewed a cat, one of several that played Goose in the movie.)Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios, which produced Captain Marvel. And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live, consider this: The live stream has been watched more than 485,000 times on YouTube alone.Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movies and television franchises. As a result, live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore. More studios are producing their own red carpet extravaganzas, hiring battalions of brand-friendly hosts to market the studio’s offerings and control social media messaging. And with technology that makes live-steaming easy, new players have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and its worldwide audience.“Movie premieres have become global moments,” said Doug Neil, Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing. “Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience.”Mr. Neil would know. Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” With an army of Academy Award winners on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere, he said. Premieres are expensive, too, sometimes costing $100,000 or more. So the festivities in London were live-streamed on Facebook, where they were viewed more than 451,000 times around the world.ImageGwyneth Paltrow at the “Avengers: Infinity War” premiere in Los Angeles last year.CreditMario Anzuoni/Reuters“The talent bench was so deep,” Mr. Neil said of the celebrities who attended. “And Facebook has our largest community of fans.” With streaming technology, he added, “It’s very easy to flip a switch.”The quality, though, can depend on whose hand is on the switch. “When we started doing this, it was iPhones on tripods,” said Alison Hoffman, chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz. Now, she said, the company teams up with media outlets, like Entertainment Weekly, People and Entertainment Tonight, to host live stream red carpet events. That was the case last June at the premiere of “Power” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The channel broadcast a live stream with three video cameras.“For the right show, it’s a critical part of the mix,” Ms. Hoffman said.That is not always the case, though. Last week, the cast of “Game of Thrones” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show. The spectacle was broadcast live by NowThis, a social media content company, which streamed unscripted, raw footage from the “Game of Thrones” press line. An HBO executive said the company was neither involved in nor aware of the live stream, which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair.Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, invited Joe Jonas, her pop star fiancé, to join her on the red carpet. “How about a kiss?” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet, the wife of Jason Momoa, who delighted as the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1. Ms. Bonet shook her head no; her husband was visibly annoyed.The video itself was sketchy, too. The camera shook and the Wi-Fi was unreliable. Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeves and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated squares. Still, the live stream has been watched more than 188,000 times on YouTube.ImageGwendoline Christie at the “Game of Thrones” premiere.CreditAmy Lombard for The New York Times“It’s not always the best quality that gets the most eyeballs,” said Tina Exarhos, the chief content officer of NowThis. “When you are on a red carpet, these are the moments you look for.”Despite the video’s raw quality, she added, “We are looking to do more and more of these with studios.”The Walt Disney Studios, which oversees Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, Pixar and its own slate of movies, has the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood. Lylle Breier, who oversees premieres and special events for the studio, said there were often multiple hosts — some on stages, others on the red carpet — and several cameras used for interviews.The movies that attract the most attention are the “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises. Last April’s red carpet premiere for “Avengers: Infinity War,” for example, has been watched 7.28 million times. There, Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company, Goop. (“She did a Goop detox and she’s fine,” she said of her stressed-out character, Pepper Potts.) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “Avengers” movie.As many as 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere. And hosts, like Ms. Cink, have jobs mostly because they are fans. “They do not ask reporter-type questions,” Ms. Breier said.Ms. Cink has hosted at least six streaming red carpet premieres and writes all her own questions. She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity: Stan Lee, the force behind Marvel Comics. (Mr. Lee died in November, and “Captain Marvel” carries a dedication to him, as well as a montage of his movie cameos in the Marvel logo.)Her background in improvisational theater is helpful, she said. Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot, which made it impossible to hear.“I looked like a deer in the headlights,” she said. “I screamed my intro. I know I looked, like, cuckoo bananas. And it was completely live. I was kicking off the whole show.”"

This is a black hole.It’s O.K. to feel lost here. Even Albert Einstein, whose theory of general relativity made it possible to conceive of such a place, thought the concept was too bizarre to exist. But Einstein was wrong, and here you are.You shouldn’t be here. Surely you will be pulled in. But fear not, dear earthling: Your brain has taken millions of years to get here, and it’s ready for this gaze into the darkness. So let’s get started.Darkness Visible, Finally: Astronomers Capture First Ever Image of a Black HoleApril 10, 2019[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]ImageBright flares are visible near the event horizon of a super-massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.CreditNASA/CXC, via MIT, via F.K.BaganoffA black hole is a hungry beastIt swallows up everything too close, too slow or too small to fight its gravitational force. With every planet, gas, star or bit of mass consumed, the black hole grows.The edge of a black hole, its event horizon, is the point of no return. At the event horizon, light is drawn in to a black hole, never to escape. And nothing is faster than light.ImageAn interpretation of a black hole, created for an educational video game.CreditDenver Museum of Nature and ScienceIf you fell into a black hole, it’s not clear how you would dieWill gravity rip you apart and crush you into the black hole’s core? Or will a firewall of energy sizzle you into oblivion? Could some essence of you ever emerge from a black hole? The question of how you would die inside a black hole is one of the biggest debates in physics. Called the firewall paradox, it was posited in March 2012 by a group of theorists including Donald Marolf, Ahmed Almheiri, James Sully and Joseph Polchinski.Based on the mathematics in Einstein’s general theory of relativity of 1915, you would fall through the event horizon unscathed, then the force of gravity would pull you into a noodle and ultimately cram you into singularity, the black hole’s infinitely dense core.What Is General Relativity?Einstein presented his general theory of relativity more than 100 years ago.But Dr. Polchinski and his team pitted Einstein against quantum theory, which posited that an event horizon is a blazing firewall of energy that would torch your body to smithereens. However, the presence of a firewall would violate the precious principles of relativity, which decreed the existence of black holes. And so physics is stuck.ImageThe brightest white spot in the middle is the very center of the Milky Way galaxy, which also marks the site of a supermassive black hole.CreditNASA/JPL-CaltechPretty much everything we know about how the universe works depends on black holes.Either someone is wrong, or we have to admit that earthlings still aren’t equipped to understand the universe. The firewall paradox calls into question the most definitive theories of science. The insights and wisdom of Einstein, Polchinski or Stephen Hawking notwithstanding, everything we know about the universe could change if we could know for certain what happens to information inside a black hole.ImageGalaxy NGC 1275.CreditNASABlack holes can singIn 2003, an international team led by the X-ray astronomer Andrew Fabian discovered the longest, oldest, lowest note in the universe — a black hole’s song — using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The B flat note, 57 octaves below middle C, appeared as sound waves that emanated from explosive events at the edge of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy NGC 1275.The notes stayed in the galaxy and never reached us, but we couldn’t have heard them anyway. The lowest note the human ear can detect has an oscillation period of one-twentieth of a second. This B flat’s period was 10 million years.The “songs” of black holes may be responsible for a declining birthrate of stars in the universe. In clusters of galaxies such as Perseus, the home of NGC 1275, the energy these notes carry is thought to keep the gases too hot to condense and form stars.ImageThe Milky Way as visible from the desert southwest of Cairo.CreditAmr Abdallah Dalsh/ReutersAstronomers have evidence for black holes in nearly every galaxy in the universeAlthough no black hole is close enough to Earth to pull the planet to its doom, there are so many black holes in the universe that counting them is impossible. Nearly every galaxy — our own Milky Way, as well as the 100 billion or so other galaxies visible from Earth — shows signs of a supermassive black hole in its center. Moreover the bigger a galaxy is, the more massive is its central black hole. Nobody knows why.How They Took the First Picture of a Black HoleA planet-sized network of radio telescopes has assembled the first image of a black hole.Of the billions of stars in the Milky Way, about one in every 1,000 new stars is massive enough to become a black hole. Our sun is not. But a star 25 times heavier is. Stellar-mass black holes result from the death of these stars, and can exist anywhere in the galaxy.VideoSupercomputer simulations show the moment when a pair of neutron stars collide, collapse into a black hole and tear themselves out of the visible universe.Black holes are stellar tombstonesOn July 2, 1967, a network of satellites recorded an explosion of gamma rays coming from outer space. In retrospect, it was one of the first indications that black holes are real. Today, scientists believe that a gamma ray burst is the final breath of a dying star and the birth of a stellar-mass black hole.The dramatic transformation starts when a massive star runs out of fuel. As the star begins to collapse, it explodes. The star’s outer layers spew out into space, but the inside implodes, becoming denser and denser, until there is too much matter in too little space. The core succumbs to its own gravitational pull and collapses into itself, in extreme cases forming a black hole.Theoretically, if you shrank any mass down into a certain amount of space, it could become a black hole. Our planet would be one if you tried to cram Earth into a pea.ImageNASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a high energy blast, likely a black hole eating, at the center of a galaxy.CreditNASA‘A black hole has no hair’On March 28, 2011, astronomers detected a long gamma ray burst coming from the center of a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. This was the first time humans observed what might have been a dormant black hole eating a star.No matter what a black hole eats — a star, a donkey, an iPhone, your grammar teacher — it’s all the same to the black hole. “A black hole has no hair,” the physicist John Archibald Wheeler once said, meaning that a black hole remembers only the mass, spin and charge of its dinner.The more a black hole eats, the more it grows. In 2011, scientists discovered one of the biggest black holes ever, more than 300 million light-years away. It weighs enough to have gobbled up 21 billion suns. Scientists want to know if the biggest black holes are the result of two holes merging or one hole eating a lot. But scientists don’t know how they grew so large.VideoThis is the story of the Event Horizon Telescope, a synchronized network of radio antennas as large as the Earth, that astronomers used to take the first ever picture of a black hole, an abyss so deep no light can escape.To find the darkness, follow the lightLight can’t escape a black hole, so seeing what’s inside one is impossible. Getting a picture of a black hole’s edge is difficult, and getting a clear picture is something else entirely.And until now, it has never been done. So far, scientists have detected black holes only indirectly, by their signatures, such as a gamma ray burst, supernova or, perhaps, an object on the brink of a black hole’s event horizon. Typically, if tremendous energy is emanating from a massive core at the center of a galaxy, the core is probably a black hole.The Event Horizon Telescope, the one Sheperd Doeleman and his colleagues used to photograph the black hole in the galaxy M87, features a cast of more than 100 scientists on four continents and one very important crystal used to calibrate atomic clocks. In April 2017 scientists staked out eight telescopes atop mountains on four continents, synchronized them, pointed them at the sky and waited. And so they brought Einstein’s monster, the black hole, into view for the first time. ImageAn artist's conception of stars moving in the central regions of a giant elliptical galaxy that harbors a black hole.CreditLynette Cook/Gemini Observatory, via Nature, via Associated PressA black hole is not foreverQuantum effects suggest that, as Hawking radiation leaks into the universe, a black hole will dissipate, eventually. It would take many times the age of the universe for a black hole to fully evaporate.Like Einstein, Dr. Hawking at first did not believe his own theory. But the numbers were right. Physicists now view his result as the backbone for whatever future theory will bring together gravity and quantum theory.ImageThis muon detector is part of one of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva. CreditFabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA giant magnet in Europe will not destroy the planetBefore the European Organization for Nuclear Research fired up the Large Hadron Collider in 2008, critics worried that smashing together protons in a 17-mile ring underground would create a black hole that would swallow the earth.Scientists had smaller ones in mind. In theory, the search for the smallest particles in the universe might kick up mini black holes in the collider’s underground tubes, enabling researchers to observe general relativity and quantum mechanics in action, and perhaps open the door to solving the firewall paradox.A decade earlier, similarly apocalyptic worries arose over Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The center’s scientists squelched these concerns by pointing out that, according to their calculations, ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays were already penetrating the atmosphere and would have created about 100 tiny black holes on Earth every year. If tiny black holes were a genuine problem, Earth would have collapsed into infinity long ago.Still, in June 2008, a safety review proclaimed the L.H.C. safe. Experiments commenced, the Higgs boson was found and Earth survived after all.Keep reading about black holesDon’t be afraidTrolling the Monster in the Heart of the Milky WayOct. 30, 2018No Escape From Black Holes?

5c4b16743a125f5075c064ff,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/davos-tech-regulation.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi, I’m Sheera Frenkel, your friendly cybersecurity reporter.I’m writing from a sunny and glorious San Francisco while the world’s elite share deep thoughts in snowy Davos, Switzerland, at an annual gathering of the rich and powerful.Executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple wined and dined with the elected officials and regulators who are responsible for holding their companies to account. A lot is at stake. The European Union is looking to enforce its new privacy regulations, and in the United States the Federal Trade Commission is expected to round out its investigation of Facebook within the next month or so.Other countries are also exploring regulation. Our colleagues at Davos reported that on Wednesday leaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germany issued a call for global oversight of the tech sector.In the next year, important elections will be held in countries including India, Indonesia, Ukraine and Israel. Everyone will be watching to see whether social media is rife with false news and disinformation, and the tech companies will have a chance to show that they’ve changed for the better.If the last week was any indication, things aren’t looking great.Everyone was reminded of the power of social media to divide when a video showing a confrontation in Washington between a group of high school students and a Native American protester went viral.The minute-long video, which was first posted by a Twitter account called @2020fight, initially inspired outrage among liberal groups that believed the students were intimidating and mocking the protester.But within two days, another version of the video, which showed the protester intentionally walking into the group of students, had appeared. Conservative groups took to Twitter to claim that the students, not the protester, were the victims. They called on celebrities and prominent journalists to apologize to the students, and a group of lawyers announced that it would sue popular figures who had tweeted defamatory statements about the incident.Days later, people were still fighting about the video on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the cable networks. The account that started it all — along with many that helped amplify it — remains anonymous.My colleague Kate Conger and I reported Wednesday that lawmakers were asking Twitter for more information about the accounts. There is concern that the accounts that amplified the tweet were foreign (read: Russian) and looking to stir discord among Americans. Twitter said it was investigating. So far, it appears that at least the original poster, @2020fight, is American.The account was suspended by Twitter. But what, at least under Twitter rules, did it do wrong? Many people on Twitter use fake names; many more use fake photos. Neither practice is explicitly against Twitter’s rules, and in many ways the account used Twitter for exactly what the platform was designed to do — to make something go viral.There’s a question of whether that is good for any of us, or whether, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo succinctly put it in his column this past week, the answer is to “Never Tweet.”■ Twitter wasn’t the only company to have a bad week. French regulators announced that they had fined Google 50 million euros, or about $57 million, for not properly disclosing how it collected data about its users across its services. Adam Satariano wrote that it was the largest penalty of its kind levied by the European Union, which last year adopted a sweeping new data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation.■ In Australia, a sweeping new law gives local law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech companies like Apple to create tools, known as back doors, that would circumvent the encryption they built into their products.My colleague Nellie Bowles reported that the law’s impact could be felt globally. If Apple were to build a back door for iPhones, law enforcement in other countries, including the United States, could ask to use the same tool.The debate about back doors to encryption has been raging for years. Tech companies argue that they encrypt devices to protect users. The police say they need access to devices, especially phones, to do their jobs.■ In other news about our dystopian future, Cade Metz wrote about start-ups that are turning high-altitude surveillance into a lucrative business. Using cameras, sensors and inexpensive satellites, the companies are selling insights gleaned from those devices to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge.■ Karen Weise wrote about how Amazon is building a huge business out of knowing everything you buy. Amazon doesn’t just know what you buy. It knows how often you buy it, where you ship it to and what you are most likely to buy next. Ads sold by Amazon are now a major part of its business, and it is quickly gaining ground on the industry leaders, Google and Facebook.■ A couple of days later, Gizmodo’s Kashmir Hill wrote an illuminating first-person account of her struggles to remove Amazon from her home. The article brought into sharp relief just how dominant Amazon is in our lives, and how hard it would be to live without the technology we have invited into our homes."
5c88d50049f0eacbf105cca6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/crosswords/essay-filling-in-the-blanks.html,"How do I explain my compulsion to finish The New York Times Sunday Magazine puzzle every week? Perhaps it’s the realization that so many experiences in life do not have “exact” answers. Some blanks just can’t be filled in. As we age, we recognize we know less than we imagined about our world, and ourselves. Solving crossword puzzles, in any way we can, satisfies that need we have to be certain about things. We hunger for the truth and finding the correct answer to a clue gives it to us, if only for a moment.I never do the Monday to Saturday puzzles. I feel guilty enough, as I already devote so much time to the Sunday crossword. But I’m compelled to finish on Sunday.Crossword puzzles made their way into my life when I was a single parent of a rambunctious little boy, commuting to a full-time job in New York City. A friend confessed she did the puzzle religiously every weekend — in ink! As soon as she heard the thump of the folded-up paper hitting her front door, she jumped to her feet to fetch it and immediately dug in. My first reaction was: Who has time for that? But like everyone with an uncertain future and a child to raise on my own, I craved the satisfaction of the crossword’s “one clue, one answer” routine.Utter Peace and CamaraderieA word lover, an English major and a writer, I could not hold out forever. Little by little, I started doing the puzzles more frequently, any time I could find a moment when someone else — child, boss, needy friend — wasn’t demanding my attention.Visiting my parents allowed me to enjoy the puzzles in nearly perfect quiet. My mother would take her grandson on an excursion down the road to the Queens Botanical Garden and Dad and I would hole up in the den, blinds closed. He’d watch his sports shows; I’d disappear in the back pages of the magazine. It was bliss for us both, utter peace and camaraderie. The silence was broken only by my requests for help with the sports questions. He was more than happy to oblige and show off his encyclopedic knowledge of the games, the scores and the players.“Dad, who was the highest scoring defenseman in N.H.L. history?”“That was Bobby Orr. You asked me that last week.” He’d turn his attention back to his bowling show.“Wait. One more. How do you spell that Dominican family name?”“Huh?” he’d ask.“It’s four letters. Brothers in baseball — ”“A-L-O-U.”“Yes, that fits! Thanks.”Building a WheelhouseMy voracious reading and the vocabulary I accumulated helped me, as did my fluency in French and smattering of Spanish phrases. In the beginning, I’d be stumped most often not only by sports but also by more esoteric clues. Even today, I couldn’t draw you a map of Africa or any of the continents, and I certainly couldn’t tell you anything about the geography. Clues like “Aardvark genus” or “Direction of Nile” or “Philodendron phyllum” had me waiting for my father to get out of his seat to get more coffee. At that point, I’d make a dive for the dictionary. I should be ashamed to say that after cheating on a few key words, I nevertheless marked “100 percent” on the puzzle when I completed it.In terms of clues, I’m stumped most often these days not by geography, anatomy or foreign words, as much as by pop culture references to hip-hop or rap culture, MTV songs, sitcom characters, the antics of celebrities and newfangled gadgets. Someone at The New York Times has evidently figured out that their next audience is in the wings and has to have clues tailored to their experiences. A viewer like me, who watches only movies on TCM and occasional animal shows on National Geographic, with no little grandchildren running underfoot, is lost. My husband’s no help. Do I reach for the dictionary? Heavens no! I grab my iPhone and Google the heck out of it. I’m not totally adrift when it comes to technology. The funny thing is I never consider my fact-seeking behavior to be cheating. As long as I solve the puzzle in any way I can, and in ink, I am satisfied.‘Can We Go Now?’Over the years, certain things have changed, others not. Now more than ever, I reach for the puzzle, sit up on a corner of the couch and lay it out on my knees. I quickly dissuade one of our cats from stretching out over the puzzle, instead patting an area next to me for her siesta.My father is with us in spirit only; my husband picks up the slack. Ensconced in his leather armchair with his book, he’s thrilled to have a little peace and quiet, a respite from my usual chattering. He knows I’ll call on him for sports- or history-related questions. Most important, he knows he can count on an hour (or two or three) in which to relax. Once in a while, he makes a crack about my crossword puzzle-solving time being “sacred,” but he respects the fact that I have to finish the puzzle before starting my day. He knows an obsession when he sees one.I do my puzzle every Saturday morning as soon as the paper arrives on our doorstep. It’s understood that I am not moving until I am good and finished. There are times when I am extremely frustrated, mumbling and grumbling out loud about how long it’s taking me to finish the darned thing.“Maybe they’re leaving letters out again? Or substituting one letter for another? Geez! The whole day’s going by — ”“Honey, why don’t you put it down for a while or bring it with you to the restaurant?”“No way.”When I finally manage to solve the puzzle and circle the 100 percent, I take a deep breath, stand and work out the cricks in my back.“Done,” I declare. “Whew, that was a hard one, but so clever.”“Great,” says my husband, laying his book aside and standing up. “Can we go out now? The sun is shining and I thought we could try that new restaurant in Mt. Kisco.”“O.K., but just let me read you a few of these puns.”“Go ahead,” he says with a slightly resigned air. “I know it makes you happy.”Janet Garber is a writer and native New Yorker.

5ca4a0a349f0eacbf1f8085e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/technology/personaltech/david-sanger-national-security.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent based in Washington, discussed the tech he’s using.You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan, one of your many roles for the newspaper. When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s, what tech were you equipped with?In retrospect, nothing very impressive. Our “portable” computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter, had a tiny cathode-ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory, which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives.Needless to say, it was a technology whose time never arrived. Oh, and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top. You put the handset of a hard-line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second. Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room, where someone would type out the story that you read to them.When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops, I sent a note to New York asking what to do with these dinosaurs. The answer I got back was: Your office looks out over Tokyo Bay. Figure it out.ImageMr. Sanger uses his laptop, a Logitech camera, two phones, a hot spot and battery pack to do his work.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesSo today the technology is lots faster, but perhaps not a lot more reliable. What’s the worst tech failure you’ve suffered?Naturally, things die when deadlines are tightest. There was the time I was rushing off the back stairs of Air Force One in the Middle East with an open laptop, story half-written and late to the editing desk, and managed to drop my computer 20 feet on the tarmac. (Not good.) I’ve had modems die in Egypt, and the blue screen of death crawl across my laptop in India. Power supplies don’t like variable current — I’ve melted my share.This has all made me focus intently on what NASA calls “mission-critical components.” If you can’t file your story — or record video, or connect up with “The Daily’’ — you might as well not be there. So I travel with a laptop and a backup iPad with a keyboard, so there is always a way to write. I take two phones — and two booster battery packs. I carry an AT&T portable hot spot, and still I’ve had to fall back at times on the built-in Wi-Fi hot spot on my iPhone. Oh, and a Logitech camera that allows me to do TV hits over a Skype connection without using the built-in pinhole camera in the laptop. So my backpack weighs plenty — and my wife and our sons think carrying it everywhere is faintly ridiculous. Until they run out of cellphone power.You’d think that belt-and-suspenders approach would cover everything. It doesn’t. In Hanoi, Vietnam, this year for a summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, we were, as my colleague Edward Wong put it, “comms cursed.” Lots of things failed. It didn’t help that I was staying in the Metropole hotel, where the meeting was being held, and security personnel blanketed the lobby with a cellphone suppression technology that keeps terrorists from detonating bombs remotely. Turns out it also keeps reporters from updating their stories on the web.You published your third book, “The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age,” last year. It’s a geopolitical look at how nations are using cyberweapons, and not just for espionage. Ever been a target?I’m afraid that if you are in my line of work — writing about the intersection of technology, spying, cybersabotage and national power — you attract attention from intelligence services. In Beijing in 2017 with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, I made the mistake of looking up something about the Tiananmen Square massacre from my hotel room, over a portable hot spot. Big mistake. The hot spot stopped working. I couldn’t revive it in Japan, or back at home. We later determined that Chinese intelligence had fried the firmware.A few years ago I began seeing that big red banner over my email account that declared: “We have detected a state-sponsored attacker seeking to obtain your data.” That could be anyone: Russians who didn’t like our investigations into the 2016 presidential election and subsequent hacks; Chinese People’s Liberation Army officers who didn’t care for our work exposing Unit 61398, which stole intellectual property; North Koreans who didn’t like our coverage of the Sony hack, the Bangladeshi central bank cyberheist or the cyberattacks on their missiles.And I’ve survived enough F.B.I. leak investigations to become mildly paranoid about our own government.ImageBose noise-canceling headphones are among the equipment that Mr. Sanger takes everywhere.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesSo what do you use to protect yourself?There is no permanent technological solution to hacking, data manipulation and, soon, deep fakes — like climate change, this is a problem we have to manage. Ultimately, we will need a mix of technology, political agreements and retaliatory responses that establish that attacks are not cost-free.That said, I’m a big fan of Google’s Advanced Protection program. It uses a combination of a key that fits in a USB slot (with a button that must be pressed) and a Bluetooth dongle, each registered to your computer or cellphone. Try to get access to someone’s accounts on a computer without that hardware present and you don’t get in.If you were cyber king for a day, what mandates would you issue?First, I’d ban the use of any voting machine that doesn’t rely on a hand-marked paper ballot, so there is something to count later. I’d require encryption for all personal information that you are asked turn over, including when I hand my passport to a hotel clerk. (Hear that, Marriott? It’s time.) And I’d make it illegal to have Social Security numbers used as an identifier on any electronic document, site, app or password combination. It’s the one number in your life you simply cannot change, without extraordinary effort. It was never intended to be used as a secure identifier. So let’s not try.ImageThe reel of Mr. Sanger’s fishing rod.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesImageAssorted flies used for fly fishing.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesWhat favorite cool technology do you always take with you?Sanity-preservation devices that cut me off from the world, from editors and from the complaints of presidents, secretaries of state and national security officials. The three most vital: Bose noise-canceling headphones, a small shortwave radio and a seven-piece, four-weight fly rod that breaks down to fit in a tube under a foot long. When the weather warms up, I carry the rod in that overloaded backpack along with a reel and a box of flies. No batteries required. I’ve been known to sneak out of hotels in early-morning hours to cast into rivers, harbors, ponds, you name it. I don’t even care if nothing’s biting — the casting is therapeutic.Don’t tell the bosses, O.K.?"
5c82944e49f0eacbf105c144,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/facebook-privacy-snapchat.html,"If you want to know why Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly so interested in privacy, I have one word for you: data.“Mark makes decisions based on data and not values,” a person familiar with Facebook’s inner workings said when I asked about the chief executive’s stunning about-face this week on the new trajectory of the social media industry he pretty much founded.I would bet a lot that Mr. Zuckerberg saw the data I have seen that shows that the future is not looking good for the bloated, oversharing, fake-news-spewing, Russian-infected big blue app that made him both rich and powerful and, now, quite vulnerable.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]And what do those numbers say? Well, first and foremost that social media is in big trouble with the young and that it is long past time for it to shift to a privacy-oriented stance that was never part of its DNA, except perhaps as a throwaway line in a news release.While Facebook has always insisted otherwise, its commitment to protecting the information of users has been weak at best since its very founding. But now Mr. Zuckerberg has written a blog post — with not one single trace of irony and with nary a mention of the many privacy abuses he has presided over — announcing that the company would be betting big on private messaging and protected communications for its billions of users.You know, like Snapchat, but on a Facebook scale.Over the years, Facebook has swiped many nifty ideas from Snapchat, the ephemeral messaging platform — which Mr. Zuckerberg actually tried to buy many years ago when it was still a start-up. That has been especially true at the Facebook-owned Instagram, which did a wholesale shoplift of Snapchat’s Stories by creating … wait for it … Instagram Stories!In a podcast interview with me, the Instagram co-founder and former chief executive Kevin Systrom did not even bother to hide the act. He said that he admired the creativity of Evan Spiegel, the Snapchat founder, and that taking a good idea and making it better was a thing that always happened in tech. He compared the Stories feature to a car radio that Instagram had simply improved on. Indeed it did, and it has been a huge hit for Facebook.That’s fair enough, I guess. But this time Mr. Zuckerberg is pilfering so much more, sketching out a future business that looks a lot like Snapchat, with a little bit like China’s WeChat mixed in. And, mostly, not at all like Facebook.The big takeaway is that the penny has finally dropped with Mr. Zuckerberg that messaging and social media are very different to users, as much as he has tried to force them into an unholy mush.All you would have to do to figure that out is ask my 16-year-old. But I recently saw some internal Snapchat data that drove this message home using data from both Snapchat and Facebook Ad Managers. It showed that Snapchat ads reach more 13- to 24-year-olds in the United States than ads on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined. Among 13- to 17-year-olds, the delta is even wider.Even if those are Snapchat stats, it is clear that the young demographic that Facebook covets doesn’t much care about public sharing via posting. If it did, would Mr. Zuckerberg have seen the need to make this announcement? He would not, since the ad-heavy Facebook bulletin board is still a huge moneymaker, and it’s much harder to make such scratch from a business focused on private messaging.That has been one of the problems of Snapchat, which is much smaller than Facebook — as well as internal missteps caused by a rotating series of managers and strategies.We want to hear from youOpinion: Losing Your Privacy in the Digital Age: Share Your StoriesFeb. 13, 2019But Mr. Spiegel’s idea — that people care a lot about privacy and don’t want the information they upload to be sold like a Christmas pig — remains a stellar one. Ironically, Mr. Zuckerberg may turn out to be the one who can make it profitable.So indulge me for a minute with a comparison: Mr. Zuckerberg is to Bill Gates as Mr. Spiegel is to Steve Jobs.Mr. Jobs always had better ideas and vision than Mr. Gates. But Apple spent a long time in dire straits while he pushed his high-level concepts about security, privacy, and design and simplicity.Mr. Gates, on the other hand, was an unqualified genius at business models and systems, and he clearly understood the depressing truth that good enough was good enough for a lot of consumers. Of course, Mr. Jobs’s stunning creativity eventually won out, with the advent of the iPod, which was soon followed by the iPhone, and, well, the rest is history. Mr. Gates and his No. 2 at Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, scoffed at the efforts of Apple before trying to backpedal furiously. It did not work.Remember the Microsoft Zune? Me neither.In a podcast interview last year, Mr. Zuckerberg name-checked Mr. Gates as an important mentor, and he has obviously learned well. He has already shown a talent for turnarounds, shifting the company from desktop to mobile in one of the most impressive management moves in tech history. While he stumbled at first by doing a Facebook phone (I don’t remember that either!), the deft Mr. Zuckerberg quickly recovered and the company has never looked back.And now this, a chance to leave behind all the headaches that come with running an enormous public platform. As I have said before, Facebook is like a megapolis, presided over by Mr. Zuckerberg. Managing it is hard, because it needs a strong police force and competent people to pick up the garbage and working sewers, and there are bad people all over the place. While the growth of this city, let’s call it ZuckTown, has been impressive, it has also been sloppily managed in ways that have hurt society.Maybe the Facebook of the future will be different. That could be a very good thing for the world, and I’m glad that Mr. Zuckerberg seems to have decided that the map laid out by Snapchat is the one to go with — even if he didn’t give Snapchat any credit for it. One person I spoke with likened Mr. Zuckerberg to a captain who has decided not to go down with a ship that has sprung some serious leaks: “He’s just going to jump to another ship rather than fix the first one. And keep on going.”I guess there is not much else to say but: Godspeed, Mark.RelatedOpinion | Zeynep TufekciZuckerberg’s So-Called Shift Toward PrivacyMarch 7, 2019Elizabeth Warren Proposes Breaking Up Tech Giants Like Amazon and FacebookMarch 8, 2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c9a232c49f0eacbf105f183,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/apple-streaming-hollywood-news-plus.html,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Yesterday, Cupertino got the kind of fevered coverage usually reserved for the unveiling of Apple’s latest gadget. But this time, the product wasn’t a watch or a phone.During the two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus, the company’s leaders detailed its plans to take on Hollywood by creating its own TV shows and documentaries. They also announced a news subscription service and a credit card.Yes, big-name celebrities like Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon were on hand for the spectacle. But tech watchers were also paying close attention because the announcements are part of a major shift for the Silicon Valley mammoth.Here’s what you need to know:Why is this such a big deal?Apple has spent a decade establishing its dominant place in consumers’ pockets by getting them hooked on iPhones. But after years of record-breaking profits, phone sales are slowing and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Amazon and Netflix.So, instead of betting on another gadget, Apple made clear yesterday that it’s “trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years,” as my colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and John Koblin reported.That means Apple is bulking up on content and services, and focusing less on hardware.Not that there isn’t a lot of Apple hardware already out there: The company counts roughly 1.4 billion active devices as the perfect vehicles for its new content.What’s this about more subscription services? First, there was Apple TV Plus, the video streaming service, which will have original programs and will include shows from networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS. Beyond that, details were sparse. No price was given.But, as my colleague Edmund Lee explained, one thing’s for sure: You won’t be able to get your favorite Netflix shows.There was more on Apple News Plus, which was described as the “Netflix of news,” but it also raised questions about Apple’s place in an information ecosystem that’s been brutal to existing publishers.A subscription will cost $9.99 per month. It will let subscribers read 300 magazines as well as articles from newspapers including The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.Executives with The Journal said they’ll hire new staff members to write content that’s exclusive to the Apple app, which Bloomberg described as a risky move that could “cannibalize existing readership.”Neither The Times nor The Washington Post has signed on.Apple also announced a video game subscription service, Apple Arcade, which is set to start this fall.Here’s what else we’re following(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

5c95010449f0eacbf105e82e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/sunday-review/new-zealand-mass-shootings.html,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The ad hoc memorial at the police cordon spread out across a wide area. Within a few hours of the terrorist attack that stole the lives of 50 people at two mosques here, there was a mountain of flowers and handwritten messages filled with anguish.“This is your home and you should have been safe here.”“Our love and prayers and sympathy are with you.”“Christchurch, Christchurch, what will we do?”The memorial was the first thing I saw when I arrived outside the first mosque the gunman targeted. Like many others, I snapped a few photos of the memorial and posted one to Instagram. But then immediately, I had a moment of déjà vu. I’d taken a very similar set of pictures in 2016 when I was covering the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.The Pulse attack had seemed like such an American nightmare — a mass shooting driven by hate — and now that nightmare had found its way to the other side of the world, to a laid-back country where violence is so rare that there isn’t even any airport security when you fly to regional hubs. ImageA memorial near the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where a gunman killed 49 people in 2016. CreditTodd Heisler/The New York TimesFrom the vantage point of this city of 375,000, the signature American exports of our age were not freedom and Hollywood fantasy but rather a cocktail of gun culture, white supremacy and Facebook, where the killer live-streamed the attack with a camera that gave it the look of an American video game.And while the causes have spread along with Instagrammable memorials, the question emerging here a week later is whether potential solutions can be globalized too.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is doing what she can to lead the way. She announced a ban on military-style assault rifles and ammunition Thursday. She has hammered social media companies for allowing and amplifying extremism. She even went to a high school this week, which lost two of its students in the attack, and told the children they need to fight prejudice.“Let New Zealand be a place where there is no tolerance for racism,” she said. “That’s something we can all do.”And yet, it’s hard to see how places like New Zealand can ever feel safe without some changes internationally. “We need to understand American laws because they affect us,” one commentator said on Radio New Zealand this week.Indeed the lack of legislative effort by American lawmakers on the issues that helped spawn the Christchurch attack — guns, racism and tech platforms — is no longer just a frustration in the United States. Now it wounds the world.There’s hard work to be done for that to change. The solution is not praying for victims or praising Ms. Ardern on Twitter. What New Zealanders want is for Americans to learn from others, for globalization to go the other way, even if it means limitations on fundamental U.S. of A. freedoms.On guns, countries like New Zealand have less to confront: Of the 3.9 million New Zealanders of gun-licensing age, 238,000 — just 6 percent — have a firearm license, according to the website GunPolicy.org. In the United States, three in 10 adults say they own a firearm.Tech companies are another challenge. Despite a growing body of research showing that the algorithms of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms push people further into violent extremism, getting those companies and their employees to dial back their self-regard and shift their priorities may be as hard as persuading gun owners to give up their AR-15s.And let’s be honest: Those are the easy things to fix compared with racism and white supremacy.Some Muslims in Christchurch are hoping that the unity of the community and New Zealand officials will set a new standard.“If we can use what happened here to say enough is enough, if we can promote what we call in New Zealand ‘aroha,’” said Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, using the Maori word for love, “maybe the people behind these shootings will change.”But according to others, the changes will need to become more common, below the ranks of public figures.Here in Christchurch, one of the first people I contacted when I arrived was Kumar Yogeeswaran, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Canterbury who studies diversity and received his Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts.We discussed the deep societal problem of not just violent racism but also the casual racism that feeds it. He said many of his nonwhite students in Christchurch have come to him with stories of ethnic slurs hurled at them or colleagues at work mocking their accents. In the aftermath of the attacks, he said some students have heard white New Zealanders express anti-immigrant sentiments, asking why they’re here and why they’ve come.“When an earthquake hits, the whole community grieves together,” Mr. Yogeeswaran said. A mass shooting that killed mostly immigrants — all of them Muslim — has not quite done the same, some New Zealanders said, noting that the unaffected have been quicker to move on while others fear additional violence from extremists across the ideological spectrum.In 2008, I wrote an article about Derek Black, who was then trying to run for local office in Florida as a white supremacist. He later renounced those views, and we were in touch this past week, emailing a bit about how New Zealand and the world could accelerate and expand the shift he made from hate to inclusion.“When Ardern says that the people who were attacked ‘are us,’ that has to become a sentiment that does not sound surprising or untrue to people,” he said. “This is a long process of people, particularly white people, redefining their in-groups and national identity.”Mr. Black thinks the only way to do this is for people not to isolate themselves.The memorials I saw were perhaps a baby step in that direction, our shared emotions made visible in lilies and words that linger.But some people did not stop there. On Thursday, I met Michael Tarren-Sweeney, a professor of child and family psychology, as he was leaving the funeral of Junaid Ismail, one of the victims. Mr. Tarren-Sweeney told me he worked with Mr. Ismail’s sister, and when I shook his hand he had dirt on it from participating in the Muslim tradition of burial, in which mourners toss handfuls of earth into the grave.Just behind him, leaning against a concrete pole at the cemetery’s edge, was Caitlin Phillips. “I’m just paying my respects,” she said. She had an iPhone in her hand. Had she seen news of the funerals on social media? Had she gone to the memorials?“No, I live around the corner,” she said. “I just wanted to come because I’ve lived here 18 years, all my life, and I’ve never seen anything so wrong.”RelatedOpinion | The Editorial BoardAmerica Deserves a Leader as Good as Jacinda ArdernMarch 21, 2019In Christchurch, New Zealand, One Family Among Many Buries a SonMarch 22, 2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c94dcab49f0eacbf105e7c5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/technology/robot-safety-regulation.html,"Hi. I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:Machines are more than ever controlled by software, not humans. Occasionally it goes fatally wrong.On March 10, 157 people died when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed. Five months earlier, another crash of the same model of airplane killed 189 people. There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidents.Reporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didn’t receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use: Under new rules, the agency delegated much of the responsibility to Boeing. If the software was at fault, and the problem did slip through the regulatory net, it raises questions about how safety-critical technology is vetted.Those questions will become more important over the next few years.A year ago, an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Uber’s autonomous cars. The vehicle’s autonomy systems failed to brake, as did the safety driver behind the wheel.Companies like Uber and Waymo, along with most of the auto industry, expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade. Such advances aren’t limited to cars — they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery. They are built on technologies, like artificial intelligence, that will make split-second decisions for humans.The Boeing software was designed to perform a simple task: Nudge the airplane’s nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated. As harder tasks are handed to software, the stakes rise.“As you create more advanced A.I. systems, the harm that can result from them failing can be really large,” said Jade Leung, a researcher at Oxford University’s Center for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence.But increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult. Hardware, from chips to special sensors, can be difficult to test. And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some A.I. algorithms make decisions.Ms. Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tail-end risks — the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned. That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures, ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems work.“Verifying the performance and safety of software is a really, really hard technical challenge,” Ms. Leung said. Nonetheless, it’s a challenge that has to be addressed.Big Tech’s new hustle: Cloud gamingWhen a company spends billions on world-leading digital infrastructure, it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it. That’s partly what is driving Google’s new Stadia gaming service, announced on Tuesday.Google’s pitch is straightforward: Think of it as Netflix for gaming. As long as they have a fast internet connection, users can pay a subscription to play high-definition games, akin to what they’d find on current top-end consoles, on any computer, phone or tablet.The company’s promise: that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable. It will add racks of gaming-specific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an on-demand, remote gaming computer. And Google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware, lag won’t be a problem — an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms, like the now-defunct OnLive.Google is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming. Microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer a trial of a similar service for Xbox consoles, computers and mobile devices this year. Amazon, which owns the game-watching service Twitch, is widely believed to be planning something similar, built on its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure.Those three companies happen to be the world’s largest cloud providers. It’s not surprising that they’re enamored of the idea of taking a slice of the $135 billion gaming industry, when all it could take is the flex of an existing muscle.The U.S. struggles to supercomputeAbout $500 million should buy a lot of computer. This past week, we found out how much. Writing for The Times, Don Clark explained what the Department of Energy would get for dropping that sum on a supercomputer:Lab officials predict it will be the first American machine to reach a milestone called “exascale” performance, surpassing a quintillion calculations per second. That’s roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date.The device, called Aurora, will be used to figure out everything from how drugs work to the impact of climate change. It’s also a useful indicator of the nation’s competitiveness in science and technology — or, at this point, whether it’s leading or lagging behind China. On that front, Mr. Clark reports that it has been a mixed bag for the United States:An IBM system called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, took back the No. 1 position last year on a twice-yearly ranking of the world’s 500 most powerful systems — a spot held by China for five years. But China leads by another key measure: It accounted for 227 systems on the Top 500 list, compared with 109 for the United States.China is expected to have its own exascale supercomputer running as soon as 2020 — a full year before Aurora boots up.And some stories you shouldn’t missGoogle received its third antitrust fine from the European Union since 2017. This one, for 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, was for imposing unfair terms on the search service it offers to other websites.Facebook will stop targeting some of its ads. It will no longer allow advertising of housing, jobs or credit to be aimed at those of a certain race, gender or age group.The Pentagon’s giant cloud contract has a one-man holdup. Deap Ubhi, a little-known entrepreneur, is at the center of a legal battle between Amazon and Oracle over the $10 billion project.Take a look at an early iPhone prototype. It’s red, about the size of an old computer motherboard and helped engineers to program the first breakthrough smartphone.A.I. researchers could give computers a little more credit. Rich Sutton, a pioneer of some of today’s most effective A.I. techniques, argues that a “bitter lesson” in artificial intelligence is that “the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.”Why is there still relatively little tech regulation? “Lawmakers are reluctant to disrupt the enormous wealth creation machine that technology has turned out to be,” according to the security expert Bruce Schneier.Screen sharing can be an easy route to professional humiliation.

5c8f9a8b49f0eacbf105da79,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/mexican-lynchings-california-rick-singer.html,"(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)It’s Monday, and the news over the weekend was dominated by the horrifying violence in New Zealand.The massacre at two mosques — in which at least 50 people were killed, apparently by a white nationalist who posted a racist manifesto online — was the latest somber reminder that violence against specific religious or ethnic communities has been persistent throughout history, though it takes different forms. Recently, my colleague Simon Romero wrote about new efforts to remember the lynchings of people of Mexican descent throughout the American West. In doing so, advocates say, we may be able to better avoid repeating them. He wrote about such killings that took place in California: An Anglo mob in Bakersfield went on a killing spree in 1877. Their victims: five men of Mexican descent.About 100 men, some wielding axes, broke into the county courthouse and overpowered the jailer. In their rampage they snatched the men from the jail, held an impromptu trial with mob members as jurors, declared them guilty of horse theft and hanged them on the courthouse lawn.The case was just one of thousands of lynchings of men, women and children of Mexican descent, a period of racist terror lasting from the mid-19th century until the 1920s. Lynchings of Mexicans, many of whom were American citizens, often faded into history, attracting less attention than the horrific mob violence targeting African-Americans around the United States.But descendants of lynching victims and historians are now campaigning to publicly remember these episodes in an effort to cast scrutiny on the atrocities and draw parallels at a time of resurgent anti-Hispanic hate crimes. California was second only to Texas in the grim ranking of mob killings of people of Mexican descent, according to the historians William D. Carrigan and Clive Webb.Many of California’s lynchings of Mexicans took place during the Gold Rush from 1848 to 1855, when Anglos chafed at having to compete with Mexicans for mining claims. Never mind that California was part of Mexico just a few years earlier; after the Mexican-American War, the United States annexed California and other Mexican lands that form what is now the American Southwest.Example of such lynchings in California abound.A mob accused Carlos Esclava of theft and hanged him in Mokelumne Hill in 1852 before a crowd of 800. Also in 1852, an especially bloody year for mob violence against Mexicans, a so-called vigilance committee in Santa Cruz hanged Domingo Hernandez after he was accused of theft. In 1853, an unidentified Mexican was hanged at Angel’s Camp for giving aid to an “outlaw” — Joaquin Murrieta, the Sonoran forty-niner known as the Robin Hood of the West.Lynchings of people of Mexican descent continued in California through the 1890s. By then, episodes like the Bakersfield killings of 1877 had provoked claims of racism against Mexicans.“Several Mexicans or native Californians raided a station or two, in the Vasquez style, and five of them were subsequently arrested and lodged in jail,” said The Lyon County Times of Silver City, Nev., one of several newspapers around the West to report on the Bakersfield lynchings.The victims of the Bakersfield lynch mob were not lost to history. They were identified as Antonio Maron, Francisco Encinas, Miguel Elias, Fermin Eideo and Bessena Ruiz.Here’s what else we’re following(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

5c8fd9ff49f0eacbf105db29,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/nyregion/albany-lawmakers-housemates.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]ALBANY — On a recent evening in the state’s capital, three lawmakers were discussing tax exemptions.State Senator Alessandra Biaggi had just wondered aloud at the challenges facing working mothers, leading a Senate colleague, Jessica Ramos, to mention a bill she had introduced to exempt breast pumps from sales taxes. That prompted Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou to interject: “Let’s talk, too, because I’m on the insurance committee.”The conversation, in the middle of the year’s budget negotiations, was hardly unusual. More unexpected was the location: Ms. Niou’s bed, where the three women were perched, in their shared apartment about two miles west of the State Capitol.State legislators have long shared lodging and ideas during their weekly pilgrimages to Albany, often taking adjoining rooms at local hotels or even buying neighboring apartments in a single co-op.Federal power brokers, including Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, have famously shared housing as well, leading to revelations about their nighttime attire (boxer shorts for Mr. Schumer) and stimulating conversations (on grandchildren and Metamucil, according to Mr. Durbin).But the three women in Albany are likely among the first to make a space like theirs: equal parts Ikea catalog, Instagram feed and campaign office.Copies of the Harvard Business Review and Self magazine lay side by side on Ms. Ramos’s bed. A book about “goals with soul” decorated Ms. Biaggi’s bedside table, near a photo of her great-grandmother and her grandfather, Mario Biaggi, a former congressman.ImageMs. Niou, a 35-year-old Democrat, won the seat held by former Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver before he was indicted on federal corruption charges.CreditHans Pennink/Associated PressMs. Biaggi said she had recently invited the chancellor of the state university system to her legislative office for the first time, where they discussed the schools in Ms. Biaggi’s district, in the Bronx and Westchester County, as well as the senator’s taste in candles: “She walked in and said, ‘Oh, it smells good,’” Ms. Biaggi said with a laugh. (She keeps a matching, triple-sec-scented one by her bed.)In the apartment stairwell, a trio of campaign posters had been taped to the wall, one for each resident.Traditionally, lawmakers’ half-week stints in Albany have conjured images of noisy bars and cheap hotel rooms. Lawmakers are given $174 for each night they spend in the capital, and they get to pocket what they don’t spend, so they have often crowded into budget hotels to save money.The system has also seen its share of abuses: Several legislators have been convicted of bilking the system.But Ms. Biaggi, Ms. Ramos and Ms. Niou are part of a new class of legislators in Albany, one that is younger and more female than ever before, the result of a front of progressive energy that delivered the Capitol into all-Democratic hands last year. Ms. Biaggi, 32, and Ms. Ramos, 33, are in their first term. Ms. Niou, 35, is in her second.All took over from powerful men: Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos defeated incumbents in the Democratic primary last year, toppling a group of breakaway senators who had long wielded disproportionate influence. Ms. Niou, also a Democrat, won the seat held by former Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver before he was indicted on federal corruption charges.The three met last summer, when Ms. Biaggi called Ms. Niou, who represents Manhattan, to ask for her endorsement. Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos had already been campaigning together for months in an effort to oust their primary opponents; Ms. Niou organized a fund-raiser for the two soon after.ImageMs. Ramos, 33, speaking with State Senator Brad Hoylman last month in Albany. She defeated an incumbent in the Democratic primary last year.CreditHans Pennink/Associated Press“We didn’t have a pipeline,” Ms. Niou said.“This is the only way that anything’s going to shift,” Ms. Biaggi said of electing more women. “It’s so obvious to me.”Ms. Ramos showed the others her Instagram story, where she had shared a clip of an interview she taped with Univision at the Capitol that day. In the video, as Ms. Ramos, who represents Queens, called for more school funding, a young girl standing nearby watched, eyes wide.Their newness was apparent in everything from the recreational — where was the best nail salon in Albany? — to the professional: “We just go on all day. It’s worse than campaigning,” Ms. Biaggi said of the marathon meetings before the state’s April 1 budget deadline.She wasn’t complaining, though: “I, like, love chaos.”Ms. Niou, the nominal veteran of the house, shook her head at Ms. Biaggi’s excitement. “It’s not what she thinks it is,” she said of the grueling budget process. “But trust me, it’s going to be a lot better.”Ms. Niou was referring to not just the new Democratic control of Albany, but also a new optimism that she said stretched beyond partisan politics.“‘This is how it’s always been done’ — people would say that to me all the time,” Ms. Niou said. But not anymore, she added.“There’s a can-do attitude,” Ms. Ramos said.The seven-room apartment costs $1,200 a month, split three ways. The lease is month to month and will end in June, when the legislative session ends. Ms. Niou’s dog, Samson, is another sometimes tenant.ImageMs. Biaggi, 32, and her roommates were part of the progressive wave that helped deliver the Capitol into all-Democratic hands last year.CreditHans Pennink/Associated PressPolitical differences are rare and slight. Ms. Biaggi said she had not decided whether she supported term limits. But she was leaning toward doing so, she added, earning a high-five from Ms. Ramos, a fervent supporter.Of the three, Ms. Ramos is the least chatty, the serene counterweight to Ms. Biaggi’s and Ms. Niou’s sometimes frenetic energy. She sleeps and wakes early; the other two prefer to stay up late and sleep in. (That has helped them divvy up time in their lone bathroom.)Ms. Ramos devotes time each day to calling her sons, who are 5 and 7 years old. “Thank God for FaceTime,” Ms. Ramos said of the iPhone app.Ms. Biaggi, who is getting married this summer, shook her head in admiration. She said she could not imagine balancing a pregnancy with being in office. “Now, if the Legislature had child care …”For now, the women said, they were having trouble even finding time for themselves. On that particular night, three of the apartment’s rooms were completely bare, save a trapeze of ceramic pots hanging from the ceiling.Ms. Niou and Ms. Biaggi had spent the previous night sitting on the floor of their empty study, discussing predatory loans. Plastic-wrapped Ikea pans sat on the stove, untouched. The refrigerator held almond milk, vegetable chips, grapefruit sparkling water and not much else.“What’s missing is the kombucha in my car,” Ms. Biaggi said.One of the women pitched the idea of a housewarming party, before furniture arrived to clutter the living room. The invitation list would include their fellow new young senators, with whom Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos have an active group text message.“Before we have a budget?” Ms. Ramos said with a laugh.Definitely, the others said — they would need a break after so many long days.Ms. Niou interjected. “Well, as long as you guys are helping me clean after.”"

Mr. Trump later reneged on that promise, and Democrats have sought the documents ever since.This week, the hunt for Mr. Trump’s tax returns moved to an unexpected locale: Albany.New York Democrats say even just the state paperwork could answer important questions about the president’s finances. Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters have dismissed efforts to make his tax returns public, calling the attempts a partisan ploy meant to embarrass the president.[Read more about New York Democrats’ strategy to get President Trump’s state tax returns.]Here’s what else you need to know:What’s happening in Albany with Mr. Trump’s taxes?A bill in the Democratic-controlled Legislature would allow the Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return requested by three committees in the United States Congress for any “specific and legitimate legislative purpose.”Governor Cuomo, a three-term Democrat and critic of the president, said through his office late Monday that he would back the new bill.Why can’t New York release Mr. Trump’s state tax returns?State laws generally prohibit such private tax information from being released. The bill would amend those laws.Still, there are other issues at play.Federal laws, for instance, shield federal tax information. If New York were to release federal return information contained within a state return, the I.R.S. wouldn’t be happy and could even “cease cooperation with the state,” said Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.Remind me again: Why do Democrats want the tax returns?Mr. Trump has kept many details of his personal and business finances a secret. He has never publicly released his tax returns, breaking decades of tradition among presidential candidates.Several inquiries in New York and Washington — as well as a lengthy New York Times investigation — have questioned whether Mr. Trump skirted any laws in turning a collection of middle-class apartment buildings he inherited from his father into a global real estate empire.What could Mr. Trump’s New York tax returns show?Because New York has been Mr. Trump’s home state, and where his real estate empire has its headquarters, those returns could reveal much of the same financial information as a federal return.How else have lawmakers tried to get Mr. Trump’s taxes?The New York Truth Act, a bill introduced in the Legislature in 2017, would have required the Department of Taxation and Finance to release five years’ worth of income tax returns from eight officials if they earned income in New York: the president, vice president, New York’s two United States senators and four statewide elected officials, including the governor and the attorney general.That bill now has enough support to pass the Legislature.Another bill would require candidates for president and vice president to reveal their past tax returns in order to appear on primary and general election ballots.Similar efforts are also being considered in more than a dozen other states, including California and New Jersey.From The TimesImageCreditJefferson Siegel for The New York TimesAllison Mack of “Smallville” pleaded guilty in the Nxivm “sex cult” case.

In recent years, the two places have developed a connection that goes far beyond their (nearly) shared name.A partnership between Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, and Mayor Jos Wienen of Haarlem has helped support tech and start-up companies from both areas, including the regular Pitchfest showdowns.“It became a friendly-competitive thing,” said Clayton Banks, a founder of Silicon Harlem, the innovation and technology hub where the Pitchfest occurred in front of venture capitalists and six judges — three Dutch and three New Yorkers.Monday’s was the fourth such matchup in recent years, and the winner — Andrea Madho, a Brooklyn entrepreneur with a clothing manufacturing start-up called Lab141 — evened the score at two wins apiece between New York and the Netherlands.The Haarlem contingent that visited Harlem included officials for the economy, culture and education. The group toured the neighborhood, visiting Sylvia’s soul food restaurant and spots that feature live jazz in an effort to recruit Harlem bands for a Haarlem jazz festival.“The two places have more than just resemblance of name, said Mr. Wienen, the Haarlem mayor. “They both have rich histories but are also working to be part of the quickly developing digital world.”After a local presenter, Karen Rios, pitched forcefully for Lifesaver, her financial health platform, Mr. Banks, of Silicon Harlem, told the Dutch contingent: “That’s how New Yorkers talk — they say things quick and get it over with.”It’s Tuesday — befriend your name twin.Metropolitan Diary: The city is a candy storeImageDear Diary:This morning a child on the wayto school observed Manhattan’s buildingsas treats in a candy store.The Chrysler Building was peppermint.Would it fit in her pocket?St. Patrick’s Cathedral all orange.The sunlight on the New York Public Libraryshone bright, the windows looked like wild strawberry.Grand Central Terminal cinnamon.People were coming in and outof the Empire State Building —it smelled like a caramel square.Lincoln Center for the Performing Artswas a box of chocolate-covered cherries.The Metropolitan Museum of Artwas row upon row of bonbons.The Flatiron Building was sweet lemon.Cooper Union watermelon,One World Trade Center apricot,Yankee Stadium was full of root beer.The Brooklyn Bridge was a lollipop.Fifth Avenue was a pack of gum.Everyone loved Wall Street,before anyone sold their sharesit was all licorice sticks.The Plaza all gummy bears.— Ernest P.

It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).On trips back to the campo where my parents grew up, and where I spent the first few years of my life, I rarely need to introduce myself. Many stop me on my way to the colmado or a relative’s house to ask, “¿Y es que tú no te acuerdas de mi?” But I never do recognize them. I left when I was a toddler, so while they see a lineage in my face — my mother’s eyes, my father’s nose — they are strangers to me. And while my aunts, who grew up carrying bath water in buckets from the river and walking around barefoot in the grass, can name all the flowers (framboyán, buganvilla, cayena) in the vast, lush backyard of their childhood, I have to ask questions, taking notes on my iPhone so I can learn to describe this place.For an immigrant (or a descendant of one) growing up in America, it can be difficult to determine when or where one’s story begins. Many feel groundless and displaced, existing between two cultures and languages. The Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa described this feeling as a third space, the “borderlands,” in her groundbreaking work of feminist and cultural theory, “Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza.” A common refrán puts it more plainly: ni de aquí, ni de allá (neither from here, nor from there).Most Latinos feel a strong connection to their country of origin: More than 60 percent describe themselves in relation to their ancestral homeland (as Mexican or Colombian-American, for example) or engage in transnational activities like sending money back home, calling family members regularly or traveling back to visit. In my experience, though, it always feels like a negotiation of two identities. In New York, I am a black Dominican; in Santo Domingo, I am an American.ImageThe writer, at home in Santo Domingo in 1992.Geraldine Isabelle Abad, a Dominican-American who plans tours for people visiting Cuba and the Dominican Republic, said that taking solo trips to her family’s country of origin has helped her integrate the different parts of her heritage. “It was eye-opening,” she said in a recent call. “It made me understand that a Dominican is not just one thing. We’re complex and diverse. There are different cultures here.” She mentioned the community of hikers she encountered while hiking Pico Duarte, the Caribbean’s highest summit, and the social justice activists creating safe spaces for queer artists in the capital as examples of the country’s cultural diversity.Being apart from her family living in the Dominican Republic wasn’t easy. “Our community values here are so strong, and that’s a gift, but it makes it hard for us to grow our own self-awareness,” Ms. Abad said. And for women in particular, there’s “that fear that a woman should have somebody to accompany her. It’s almost radical for a woman to be alone and traveling. People are afraid for us.” She hopes to dispel the misconception among Dominican-Americans that the island is unsafe outside of Punta Cana, so she created the Dominican Diaspora Heritage Tours, a culturally immersive experience curated for Dominicans living elsewhere.Reconnecting with our native countries on our own terms is one way to merge our present-day selves with our family history. A friend from New York offered another idea: She has only felt fully herself within the four walls of her apartment, the home she built after leaving home.

5c8903ca49f0eacbf105cd3b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/spotify-apple-complaint.html,"LONDON — Apple’s powerful role as gatekeeper of the App Store has long frustrated the makers of apps who must abide by its rules or risk losing access to hundreds of millions of customers who own Apple devices.Now one of Apple’s biggest rivals, the music streaming service Spotify, says Apple is abusing its position and violating European antitrust laws.In an aggressive attempt to undercut Apple’s power, Spotify said on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash companies that compete with its services, including Apple Music.Spotify’s complaint comes at perilous moment for the world’s biggest tech companies. Scrutiny over Silicon Valley’s power has been increasing in recent years, and has already become a topic among Democratic presidential hopefuls.One of them, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, last week proposed breaking up the tech giants as a remedy to their unfair advantages. One of her ideas was to separate the App Store from Apple.“Spotify’s complaint is just the latest example of what can happen when these enormous companies abuse their power to undermine competition,” Ms. Warren said in a statement Wednesday. “We need a level playing field, and that starts by breaking up giant tech companies who both own a marketplace and operate in that same marketplace.”On Wednesday, a British government report also called for tougher antitrust laws for the industry.Apple’s role as a make-or-break arbiter has long frustrated app makers by imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on anything sold through its App Store.Spotify, which has headquarters in Luxembourg and Sweden, said it had told the European Commission, an aggressive regulator of the tech industry, that the policies were not just a costly nuisance but a “tax” that violated competition laws and merited an investigation.The policies have been particularly vexing for companies, like Spotify, that compete with Apple. Spotify and Apple Music are the world’s largest music streaming services.“They continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn,” Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, said in a message posted on the company’s website. He said Apple was acting as both ""player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.”Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said the fees are reasonable given that it must maintain the App Store and is providing access to millions of potential customers who own Apple devices.Apple’s introduction of the App Store in 2008 revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for consumers to download games, productivity tools and social networking services. There are now more than two million apps available on the App Store.Companies like Spotify have thrived on Apple’s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google’s Play Store.Spotify’s overall sales last year rose 29 percent to 5.3 billion euros, or about $6 billion, but the company is not profitable and is under pressure from investors to improve its margins. The company paid about 74 percent of its revenue to cover music rights and related costs.Spotify has been a formidable competitor to Apple in attracting customers for music streaming. Spotify said that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, including 96 million who were signed up for a paid subscription that did not include ads. In January, Apple said that its Apple Music service had 50 million paying users.Apple’s control over the App Store has been an increasing source of tension as the company has focused more on online services that compete with many of the apps sold on its platform. As iPhone sales have leveled off, Apple has relied more on sales of software and services. The largest driver of that sort of revenue is the App Store.Spotify said Apple was continually changing its policies to harm competitors.“Apps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store,” Mr. Ek said. “We should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions — including Apple Music.”A search for “music” on the App Store on Wednesday showed how Apple can give itself an advantage. The top result was an ad for Apple Music, followed by eight more results for Apple apps. Spotify was listed 11th.Companies are finding ways to reduce the fees they pay to Apple. In 2016, Spotify started sending customers to an outside website to make a payment rather than processing charges within its app. Netflix and Amazon have made similar moves.As a result, Spotify generally does not share revenue with Apple for customers who signed up after 2016, but pays 15 percent for customers who signed up before that period. Apple’s fee decreases to 15 percent from 30 percent after the first year of a subscription.Sensor Tower, an app-data firm, estimated that Apple still took in 23 percent of the roughly $670 million consumers spent on Spotify on the App Store from 2015 through 2018.But Apple punishes companies that do not use its payment system by restricting their ability to communicate with customers and preventing the release of app updates, Spotify claimed. Spotify accused Apple of blocking its app and other Apple competitors from services such as Siri, HomePod and Apple Watch.Spotify said Apple also treated companies differently. Uber, for example, is not required to pay a fee to Apple for charges through its app.Apple demonstrated its power this year when, in response to Facebook’s violating its app rules, it  temporarily shut down Facebook’s internal apps, including those for the company’s cafeteria menu and shuttle schedule.The European Commission has a history of turning a company’s antitrust complaints into larger investigations of tech platforms. Last year, it fined Google a record €4.34 billion, about $5.1 billion at the time, for antitrust abuses related to its Android operating system, and forced Google to effectively loosen its grip over the platform. Google is appealing. European officials are also investigating possible anticompetitive practices by Amazon.European regulators have expressed concerns about Apple’s dominance in music. Last year, the European Commission held up Apple’s acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns it would harm competition, though the deal was eventually approved. In 2016, the commission accused Apple of a tax avoidance scheme and ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland, a decision Apple is appealing.It is unclear whether Spotify’s complaint will lead European regulators to start a formal investigation of Apple. The term of Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust official in the European Commission, ends this year, meaning the decision could fall to her successor.“The commission has received a complaint by Spotify, which we are assessing under our standard procedures,” the commission said in a statement.In the United States, the Supreme Court is considering a suit brought by consumers claiming that Apple’s control over the App Store represents an unfair monopoly, forcing customers to pay higher prices than they would in a more open market."
5c839d0c49f0eacbf105c321,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/style/project-runway-bravo-karlie-kloss-christian-siriano.html,"“Project Runway” arrived on television at the end of 2004, the same year that Mark Zuckerberg created a website called The Facebook at Harvard. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone. Three years later, when “Project Runway” was in its seventh season, Instagram appeared in the App Store.That tech-history lesson is to say: 2019 looks a whole lot different from 2004. So when Bravo reacquired the rights to “Project Runway” last year, the network wasted no time in recalibrating the show, which will have its premiere on Thursday. The most significant of the changes is the cast.Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum, whose faces have been synonymous with “Project Runway,” announced last September that they would not return to the show and that they are developing a new fashion series with Amazon, where viewers will be able to buy the styles they like through the website. Zac Posen, who replaced the designer Michael Kors, also departed. Nina Garcia, now the editor of Elle, is the only remaining member of the original cast.“Heidi and Tim were the originals, and I enjoyed working with them,” said Shari Levine, the executive vice president for current production at Bravo. “But this is 15 years later. It’s important that the show evolve and look to the next generation.” Die-hard fans may embrace the new cast or see them as impostors, but Bravo’s picks carry significant credentials. ImageTim Gunn, center, with Daniel Vosovic in Season 2 of “Project Runway,” 2005.CreditBarbara Nitke/BravoImageHeidi Klum, with models, 2004.CreditBarbara Nitke/BravoThe new host is the supermodel Karlie Kloss, who is also the founder of Kode With Klossy, a nonprofit that hosts coding camps for girls around the country. Christian Siriano, who won the “Project Runway” competition in its fourth season and made a name for himself as a designer to the stars and a champion for inclusivity, is the new mentor. Joining Ms. Garcia on the judges’ row are Elaine Welteroth, who is the former editor of Teen Vogue, and the designer Brandon Maxwell, who most recently made a splash dressing Lady Gaga for the Oscars.Guests will include the rapper Cardi B and Dapper Dan, who in the 1980s and ’90s made “knockups” using the Gucci logo without permission and who has recently made a buzzy comeback with a Harlem atelier and an authorized Gucci collaboration. Bravo is surely counting on these casting choices to help revive the show’s ratings. According to Nielsen, Season 5 drew the most viewers: almost 3.6 million per episode. By Season 16, the last to air, the audience was roughly half that.Though “Project Runway” was ahead of the curve in some ways — bringing in a designer who incorporated magnets, cameras and other technology into her work, for instance, or asking contestants to make clothing from waste (a Heron Preston move before Heron Preston) — the show also had moments best left in the past. Fans will remember an episode in which Mr. Gunn called a model “zaftig” and then elaborated, saying, “She’s a little large.” Today Mr. Gunn would be swiftly “canceled” across social media for such a comment. The culture has changed. And one of those changes — the #MeToo movement — is in part the reason the show is back on Bravo. ImageNadine Ralliford and Gary Spampinato appear on the new season of the show.CreditKarolina Wojtasik/Bravo“Project Runway” was owned by the Weinstein Company, which declared bankruptcy last year after dozens of women accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct that spanned decades. Though the show ran on Bravo for its first five seasons, the Weinstein Company signed a deal in 2008 to move it to Lifetime. But after allegations against Mr. Weinstein became public in 2017, Lifetime’s parent, A&E Television Networks, accused the Weinstein Company of breaching its contract and ended all of its obligations to the show, including the airing of Seasons 17 and 18.In May 2018, a Delaware bankruptcy court approved a bid from Lantern Capital Partners to acquire the Weinstein Company’s assets. Days later, Bravo announced that “Project Runway” would return.“It’s been on another network for 10 years, but if you asked a lot of people, they would tell you it’s a show on Bravo,” Ms. Levine said. “We defined it, and it defined us.”A long-running criticism of “Project Runway” is that over a 14-year run, it produced only one high-profile designer: Mr. Siriano. Many of its contestants opened boutiques or started their own lines, but none reached the mainstream recognition of Mr. Siriano. “A lot of people went to design school and wanted to become designers because of that show,” said Fern Mallis, the industry executive widely credited with organizing New York Fashion Week (and who appeared on “Project Runway” several times as a guest judge). “On the other hand, it falsely created a sense that if you sew two pieces of fabric together, you’re a designer.” Ms. Mallis added that many of the challenges tested the contestants’ artistic abilities but not their understanding of the moneymaking side of fashion. “Your business still has to manufacture, deliver and price items correctly,” she said. Some of the changes in the 17th season nod to those concerns. Bravo has increased the prize money to $250,000; thrown in a mentorship with the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which runs the main New York Fashion Week calendar; and added a “flash sale” component to some of the episodes, which will allow viewers to purchase the top looks, as decided by them and the judges.ImageA still from the new season.CreditKarolina Wojtasik/Bravo“One of the disconnects about the previous show was that if you loved it, you couldn’t necessarily buy it,” Mr. Maxwell said in a phone call. The change was both a response to the new culture of consumerism — items are a click away — and a way to engage the audience in real time. “Everything is changing in retail,” Ms. Kloss said over breakfast at Mercer Kitchen in SoHo in February. “Here we are in SoHo, and there are so many vacant spaces.”Ms. Welteroth, sitting next to Ms. Kloss, chimed in. “You cannot underestimate the power of the digital revolution,” she said. “Before, there was no dialogue unless you were writing a letter and snail-mailing it in. Now you hear the voices of the people you’re reaching instantly. That gives the consumer or the reader much more power. You can no longer ignore marginalized voices who are saying, ‘Hey, this doesn’t reflect me, this offends me, this doesn’t include me.’” She added: “You can sell online without ever getting the approval of Vogue.”Ms. Welteroth, who is credited with reinventing Teen Vogue as a more socially conscious, politically engaged publication, noted that designers have to be conscious of the world around them. “You have to be mindful of what is happening and really conscious in how you create and what stories you’re telling,” she said.To that end, one of the challenges on the new “Project Runway” will ask each designer to think about and create designs for an issue they want to champion. The new show also strives to reflect a broader swath of experiences. “I’m really proud we have women of all shapes and sizes and the first transgender model in ‘Project Runway’ history,” Ms. Kloss said. “Fashion should serve everyone.” The new judges said they adjusted to their roles quickly, each finding a personal rhythm and style. “Brandon would have, like, really funny stuff,” Ms. Welteroth said of Mr. Maxwell’s design notes. “Like, ‘cowgirl goes to SoulCycle.’ Or he would just put a big ‘No.’ One time Nina left early, and we looked at her cards, and we were, like, ‘Wow.’ We saved them. They were so good.” Ms. Kloss turned to Ms. Welteroth. “Your notes were, like, there was not an ounce of space left on the card,” she said. “I would just have three words.”For all the changes, some things stay the same, even in the “one day you’re in, one day you’re out” world of fashion. “I felt like all I talked about was fabric,” Mr. Siriano said of his time as a mentor. “The importance of choosing the right fabric,” he said, “will exist till the end of time. Satin doesn’t change.” And besides, he said, “If you can’t pick one fabric for one challenge, how are you making a collection four times a year for customers around the world?”"

Here’s the latest: ImageIn the last two to three years, not only have students and academics fled Turkey, but also entrepreneurs, businesspeople and thousands of wealthy individuals.CreditOzan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe draining of Turkey’s money and talentFor 17 years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won elections by promising to restore Turkey to the glories of its Ottoman past. But after a failed 2016 coup, Mr. Erdogan enforced a sweeping crackdown. In its wake, the economy took a hit and the lira plunged after he won re-election with even greater authoritarian powers. Now, Turks are leaving in droves.Lasting effect: Driven by fear of persecution and economic mismanagement, the exodus threatens to reorder society permanently and set Turkey back decades.Analysis: “The brain drain is real,” one expert said of the flight of more than 250,000 Turkish citizens last year.ImageApple’s surprise announcement was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble.CreditWu Hong/EPA, via ShutterstockApple’s China slump Apple cut its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing a steep drop in iPhone sales in China. In a letter to shareholders, the company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.The takeaway: The company’s announcement added to concerns about the ability of U.S. tech giants to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy and a continuing trade war with China.

That’s where doula culture interpreters come in, a relatively new concept in the Swedish delivery room. The doula interpreters not only act as birth coaches but also provide translation services between medical professionals and immigrants.Why it’s important: Studies show that the support of a trained doula can reduce the risk of complications and interventions during childbirth.Impact: “This was a typical example where it went well, very much because the doula could explain,” one doula interpreter said after a delivery. “I think it helped her be more courageous that the doula was there.”Here’s what else is happeningIndia: Two women in the southern Indian state of Kerala entered a centuries-old Hindu shrine that has long barred women of childbearing age.

Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used.

5c38d2a33a125f5075c03f55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/business/market-time-play-defense.html,"After months of stock market declines, investment strategists are divided on appropriate responses.There is a range of possible approaches, none as simple as the kind of straightforward investing that can lead to immediate rewards when the market is consistently rising.Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, for example, is currently unimpressed with most stocks.“We do advise our investors to hold lower allocations to global equities — particularly U.S. equities — than normal,” Mr. Brightman said. He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with “the exception of M.L.P.s,” all are expensively priced.Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. “The problem with cash is you don’t make any money,” Mr. Brightman said. “It’s the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.”Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least “thinking about” tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund’s benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies — defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage — also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018 were: Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F., which was basically flat, and Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. “When companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies,” he said. “Even the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There’s only so many iPhones you can sell.”With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. “I spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,” he said. “I welcome the idea that they’ve become more aware.”Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix’s $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn “is pretty normal. This is not something to panic about.” He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. “CME Group benefits from volatility,” he said.In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, said, “This is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive.” There are still “pockets of quality” in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. “We are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,” she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. “We don’t expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,” she said. “We certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.”Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor’s view of the larger economy. “If an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.”But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. “Things can change very quickly,” he said."
5c946c2f49f0eacbf105e68e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/fashion/jewelry-books-rizzoli-flammarion.html,"“Today people are looking for books that are more than just a reproduction of jewelry,” said Suzanne Tise-Isoré, editorial director of Flammarion’s style and design division. “They want something that is beautiful to touch and beautiful to look at and is something more of an experience.”As books fight for shelf space — and compete with Instagram, here are some examples of recent volumes on jewelers, a jewelry house and a museum.ImageThe careerFor the first time the Hong Kong-based jeweler Michelle Ong has encapsulated her career since she started the Carnet label in 1998 in a book, “Carnet by Michelle Ong,” by Vivienne Becker, scheduled to be published by Thames & Hudson in Europe on April 11 and in the United States June 11 ($95.00). It published in Asia earlier this month.“I wanted to see how the jewelry had developed and how the brand has grown,” Ms. Ong said, “and it’s good to take a step backwards to see the inspiration, designs and craftsmanship.” The 272-page volume took two years to produce, partly because she had to borrow most of the pieces from clients to have them photographed. Helping Ms. Ong to select jewels for the work was her mentor and friend Joel Rosenthal, better known as the Paris jeweler JAR — “because,” she said, “I am so involved and don’t see how the pieces look and how they come together.” Mr. Rosenthal also wrote the foreword.Oriental themes from flora to patterns form the book’s structure as, Ms. Ong said, “it’s easier to see how I do the East-West fusion.” It’s an aesthetic that has defined her career from the start, such as her 1998 jadeite dragonfly brooch with black, brown and white diamonds.The book’s large photographs make her designs look like art pieces, and the inclusion of preparatory gouaches alongside images of the finished pieces allow “this book to be different from other jewelry books, and surprise people,” she said.ImageThe gold period“It’s like having a baby,” the Taiwanese jeweler Anna Hu said about producing her color-drenched “Symphony of Jewels: Opus 2,” with text by Sarah Davis. “I have to think about every stage — like the gold cover, which took me two months to decide.” (The gold cover is underneath the book’s jacket.)Published by Vendome Press on Feb. 14 in Britain and March 12 in the United States ($75), the book charts her work over the last five years, from butterflies with diamonds, black opals and other stones to contemporary art pieces such as a 8.54-carat sapphire Petales d’Amour cuff with Paraiba tourmalines, colored sapphires and green garnets. Ms. Hu’s love of color leaps off each page, making this one of the most vibrant jewelry books.The display in each chapter has a different theme, like the ballerina designs on floral patterns or the sets on a white background “to present the jewels in a crisp, sharp way,” she said. And there are unusual treatments, like a laser-cut page that, she said, “shows how the stones of my pieces are set.”Work on the book (which is intended to be part of a 10-book series) also prompted some additional designs. Case in point: the ballerina flowers that became an 11-piece collection, she said.The book, she said, also has made her sales process more efficient, as clients can look at it before they meet with her, “before they tell me what they want and before I tell them what I design.“ImageThe exhibitionMaharajas’ turban ornaments with diamonds and feathers, gold anklets, bejeweled daggers, as well as a jade hookah base feature among the more than 150 pieces included in a new take on the Al Thani collection in “East Meets West: Jewels of the Maharajas from the Al Thani Collection” by Martin Chapman. Published by Prestel last November in Europe and last December in the United States ($39.95), the book reflects the exhibition of the same title at the Legion of Honor museum of San Francisco, which ended in February.The Al Thani collection is no stranger to a book or an exhibition: It was staged at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2014, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London in 2015 and the Doge’s Palace in Venice (where some pieces were stolen in 2018). Yet this book and exhibition offered a fresh take, said Mr. Chapman, by looking at the collection through two themes: Exploring how the East and West influenced each other’s jewelry traditions, and gender, such as the “wearing of jewelry by the great rulers of India and the female wearing of similar jewelry in the West in the 20th century,” he said.The themes were mentioned in “Beyond Extravagance,” the 2013 book on the collection, but, Mr. Chapman said, “I pulled them out to the front in order to make the exhibition and book different.” he said. The book also has extra information on gemstones and jewelry making techniques, as, for example, “people don’t necessarily know what a spinel is, although they are hugely valuable in the market,” he said.ImageThe lifestyleThe Mumbai-based jeweler Farah Khan is celebrating her 25-year career with “Farah Khan: A Bejewelled Life,” edited by Paola de Luca, scheduled to be published worldwide by Rizzoli on April 2 ($125).“A lot of people ask me what inspired you, how do you design,” Ms. Khan said, “and saying it in words wasn’t enough and I wanted to say it pictorially because that’s the way I think.”The book, the first about the jeweler, includes photographs of creations like a floral choker of yellow gold, accented with pearls, rubies and diamonds, and a rose gold knuckle ring with rubellites and kyanites, but it also is a revealing account of her life. (She even recounts the 2011 legal battle with a former business partner to keep the rights to her name.)Personal touches proved to be innovative elements, such as Ms. Khan’s iPhone photos of seascapes and quotes from writers that she relates to her jewelry. Consider her Infinite Horizons 18-karat yellow gold earrings with carnelian, tanzanite beads, pearls and diamonds, which she paired with the line: “Where the sun meets the sea, is where you will find me,” from the song “Where the Sun Meets the Sea,” by the contemporary Christian duo Jason and deMarco. “When I looked at the jewelry,” Ms. Khan said, “it looks like a sunset.”She said she hopes that the book will prompt people to see her “as a creative person, which will help me go into other areas of design.”ImageThe collectionCartier’s color heritage — and the haute joaillerie collection it introduced last July — are the focuses of “Coloratura: High Jewelry and Precious Objects by Cartier,” written by François Chaille.The collection was named after the word for an elaborate operatic melody, and derived from the Latin word colorare (to color).The book evolved alongside the collection, taking a year to produce as “we had to wait for each piece to come out of the workshop to be photographed,” said Ms Tise-Isoré of Flammarion, which published the book in February ($125).Each chapter focuses on the jewelry of a particular color or color combination: from the house’s emblematic red to its 1920s-era signature blue and green, including a platinum Panthère Impérieuse necklace with a 41.06-carat cabochon-cut Ceylon sapphire and two diamond- and sapphire-studded panthers with emerald eyes.Artworks related to the color themes introduce each chapter “to link the book to something more than the jewelry and have a real context,” Ms. Tise-Isoré said. For example: Dan Flavin’s white fluorescent tubes, which show that white is a color."
5c76d39d49f0eacbf105a7a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/personaltech/digital-footprint-surveillance.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Paul Mozur, a technology correspondent based in Shanghai, discussed the tech he’s using.What are your most important tech tools for reporting in Shanghai, especially with a government known for surveillance?In China, evading the watchful eyes of the government sometimes feels like an exercise in futility. The place is wired with about 200 million surveillance cameras, Beijing controls the telecom companies, and every internet company has to hand over data when the police want it. They also know where journalists live because we register our address with police. In Shanghai, the police regularly come to my apartment; once they demanded to come inside.That said, China is big, and the government less than competent. Sometimes the police who come to my door have no idea I’m a journalist. Usually the higher-ups who deal with my visa don’t know about the house visits. The lack of coordination means one of the best things to do is to try to slip through the cracks. Basically, protect yourself but also leave an innocent trace.I use an iPhone because Apple tends to be more secure than Android. That’s especially true in China, where the blocks against Google mean there are a huge number of third-party Android stores peddling all kinds of sketchy apps.It’s also important to realize that because Beijing controls the telecoms, your domestic phone number can be a liability. For secure apps like Signal, I toggle the registration lock so that if they try to mirror my phone, my account still has a layer of protection.ImageThe Chinese messaging app WeChat is widely used but is also closely monitored.CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesImagePaul Mozur works on a Mac because, he says, Apple tends to be more secure than Android.CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesTo get around the Great Firewall, I use a few different VPNs, which I won’t name because when we do bring them up they usually get new government attention.In some parts of China, the police will demand to check your phone, usually to delete photos. Having two phones helps with this — to make it even trickier, I have the same case on both phones. But it’s also good to have other ways to protect your data. I use a few apps that disguise themselves as something innocuous but in fact hide and protect data. It’s also always handy to have a USB drive that can plug into your phone and be used to save stuff quickly.What do you do to keep sources secure?As my colleague Li Yuan noted, WeChat is a reporter’s best friend in China. Everyone spends huge amounts of time on it. But WeChat is also closely monitored, so when a sensitive topic comes up, I try to guide people to use more secure apps. That can also be a problem, though, because setting up an encrypted messaging app can alert the authorities to the person. In light of that, personal meetings also work. Often that means leaving the phone at home, since a device’s microphone can become a listening device. There are also special Faraday bags, which block communications signals and can help you go dark with your phone on you. Sometimes all the surveillance here makes me want to put one on my head. In some cases, it’s not possible to get around the government, and you have to make a judgment call about whether the source understands the risks and how severe the punishment might be. Sometimes we go places and it’s not possible to safely interview people, so we don’t. The government frequently wins.What is the oddest surveillance tech you’ve seen in China?China is a gadget-loving nation. Often technology that doesn’t totally work is embraced with alacrity. I think my favorite example was the facial-recognition sunglasses that made the rounds last year. The police were rocking these glasses, with a camera that plugged into a smartphone-like minicomputer. The idea was the glasses could identify people as the police looked at them. When I got to try them on, I found out they didn’t work all that well.ImageHaving two phones helps when the police in some parts of China demand to check one, Mr. Mozur said. CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesIn some ways, that doesn’t matter. If you convince people you know everything about them, they’re less likely to break rules. The police officer told me about how they had used the glasses to intimidate a drug smuggler into a full confession. It shows you that tech doesn’t always have to function in order to work.I actually was talking about that with my editor the other day. When he calls from Hong Kong, there’s a pause of several seconds before the phone connects. It could be the government listening in, or maybe it’s just a slow network. We can’t be sure, but we sure are paranoid, and we often joke about it.What kind of protections do you take when you travel in China?The Chinese police are famous for showing up in hotel rooms. They don’t always do it, but it happens enough that when you’re in China, you shouldn’t leave your devices in your room unattended. In 2009, when I returned to my room while reporting out of the western region of Xinjiang, I found a police officer reclining on the bed, smoking a cigarette and casually swiping through the photos on my digital camera. To avoid lugging a laptop everywhere I go, I now just travel with two phones and a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard I can use to quickly write up notes or articles directly on the phone. It’s not entirely secure, since there are devices that intercept Bluetooth communications, so for passwords I type directly on the phone.Other than that, I figure that if the Chinese authorities want to intercept my Bluetooth keyboard signal, they’ll just get an appreciation of how little work my editors have to do to my sterling copy.Image""To avoid lugging a laptop everywhere I go, I now just travel with two phones and a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard,"" Mr. Mozur said.CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesIt should also be said that for all these precautions, there’s no doubt the authorities have plenty of ways into our communications. It’s almost impossible to stop a determined state actor, but it’s worth making it more difficult.How do people in China view the privacy awakening in the United States after the Cambridge Analytica scandal and other data snafus? The privacy situation is dreadful in China. Personal data of all stripes leaks from companies and government alike. While there’s an assumption of some level of monitoring, many Chinese are as appalled as Americans when it affects them.Amusingly, even the government doesn’t trust the government. In reporting on data sharing between different ministries, I’ve found that it’s not uncommon for one part of the government to distrust another to the point it won’t share data. At other times, a government branch might not even trust itself to handle data. For a country trying to become a superpower of artificial intelligence, big data, cyberspace, innovation and whatever buzzword dominates tech next, it’s a pretty big problem.Then again, when it comes to poor privacy protection, the United States seems to be doing its best to take on China."
5c76b0c849f0eacbf105a732,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/style/the-edit-fomo-left-out.html,"Welcome to The Edit. Each week in our newsletter, you’ll hear from college students and recent graduates about issues going on in their lives. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.It was my first semester of college, and I was still finding my footing. I rushed and pledged a sorority. I also joined an academic program, all in the hopes of being socially engaged and establishing genuine friendships I could rely on during college.There were still lonely days, but things were looking up. A group of us were having semiregular game nights and restaurant outings, which to me was the very definition of college besties. One Friday, I joyfully announced to my mom over the phone, “I think I finally found my friend group!”Later that afternoon, my three new friends told me individually that they would be out of town that weekend. I assumed they each had plans. No big deal. Then I checked Instagram the next day.They were spending the weekend in Chattanooga together. How did I know? Every facet of the trip was documented on Instagram. There they were, eating ice cream and having a photo shoot in front of a pink polka-dot wall. There they were laughing on a bridge and there they were playing in the leaves. There they were, having fun without me.We tend to talk a lot about having FOMO when we scroll through our social media feeds, but fearing you’re missing out and knowing you’ve been left out are different. We can let our imaginations fill in the gaps about other people’s lives, but sometimes it doesn’t take much imagination at all to see that people are doing awesome things without you. That’s the cost of living with social media.It seems like everyone has a story like mine. Savannah Elliott, another student at my school, Samford University, remembers asking a friend if she wanted to hang out one weekend. “She said she was sick with the flu,” Ms. Elliott said. “I saw later on Instagram stories that she gave a party and didn’t invite me.”Laura Asher, a junior sociology major from Kentucky, recalled a time her freshman year when she asked her friends what they were doing that night. “Nobody texted me back. I assumed that they were just staying home for the night,” Ms. Asher said. “Later I checked Instagram and saw they had all posted pictures and Stories of them at a country concert.”Research shows these negative reactions to our social media feeds aren’t limited to us few. One study by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that young adults with higher social media use seem to feel more socially isolated than young adults with lower social media use. Even worse, the journal Computers in Human Behavior found that for young adults, the use of more social media platforms is linked to higher risks of symptoms of anxiety and depression.You’ll never be invited to everything. But it can be hard to not feel hurt and betrayed when you see exactly what you’re missing plastered all over social media. So what can you do? Philip Galanes, who advises on many awkward situations for The Times’s Social Q’s, weighed in with some guidance.Take a step back and maybe a deep breath.There may be a reason that you weren’t invited that isn’t personal. Instead of confronting the group, Mr. Galanes said, “it’s a lot more productive to try to step back, find some peace, and don’t assume that the intention was all about you. Even if it feels like it’s about you, it’s not really about you.” There might have been a limited number of people that the host could invite, or the gathering could have been spontaneous.Keeping a bigger perspective is also vital. “All the good things that happen to us we take for granted and the one bad thing that happens to us becomes the center of our universe,” Mr. Galanes said. “It’s only one weekend out of 52.”Vent about it.Sometimes just talking it out is the most helpful thing to do. But you should be cautious about talking to the offending party about the situation. That will most likely “push them farther away, not draw them in,” Mr. Galanes said.Instead, talk to the person in the group that you’re closest too. Give yourself a little emotional distance from it. Then, if you have to say something, try: “I’m really sorry you didn’t include me in this.” When you see the group again, “don’t be tight and frosty because you feel rejected, Mr. Galanes said. “That won’t help at all.”Cut your losses.Ask yourself: “Would these people knowingly hurt me, or might something else be going on?” If you suspect that your friends were indeed being malicious, it’s time to let them go. Look in the mirror.It can be helpful to evaluate your role in the situation. I was really hurt when I wasn’t invited to that trip, but I realized I hadn’t been the one reaching out to those friends in a while. I may have been dropping the ball on those friendships for a while before I felt the other side of that neglect.Put down your phone.It might help to take a social media break. I’ll delete the apps from my phone for a week or two when anxious or jealous feelings start cropping up. It’s not always easy to stay away, but there are other apps and even detox programs that can help you unplug.At the end of the day, “we’re all going to be excluded,” Mr. Galanes said.

It is spreading quietly across the globe, in Venezuela, Spain, Britain, India, Pakistan, South Africa and the U.S. Once the germ is present, it is hard to eradicate from a facility. Some hospitals have had to bring in special cleaning equipment and even rip out floor and ceiling tiles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently added it to a list of germs deemed “urgent threats.”Here are some basic facts about Candida auris.The problem: Fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines. Even as world health leaders have pleaded for restraint in prescribing antimicrobial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi, overuse of them has continued.Risk: According to a study funded by the British government, if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance, 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050, eclipsing the eight million expected to die that year from cancer.ImageCommunist Party members using the Study the Great Nation app during a weekly meeting in Beijing in February.

That wide adoption stems, at least in part, from coercion.Related: A lurid online campaign that has targeted a Chinese activist now living in Canada appears to have the hallmarks of an attack by the Communist Party.

Sixty countries have banned it.But for one Russian town 900 miles east of Moscow, nearly every family’s livelihood depends on the product. Many in Asbest, a top Russian producer of asbestos, reacted with glee to reports that the Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump was relaxing tight restrictions on asbestos use in the United States.Local perspective: The view of many Asbest residents is that there are so many other things to worry about in their heavily industrialized region, including a nuclear power station just a few miles away and an even nearer coal-fired power plant, that asbestos is probably the least of their worries.“Everything is potentially dangerous,” one resident said. “Why worry about asbestos so much?”If you’re following the Indian electionsThe farming voteImageA wholesale market in Chennai, India, in February.CreditArun Sankar/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn 1981, a lawmaker strolled into India’s upper house wearing a garland of onions to protest the staple’s rising price.

The deadly fungus is impervious to major antifungal medications.CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesThe quiet spread of a lethal fungusA tenacious fungus called Candida auris, which can kill people with weakened immune systems, has appeared in countries around the world over the past five years. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed it an “urgent threat.” Hospitals and governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks, and a hushed panic is playing out. Here are some basic facts about the fungal infection.Big picture: Antibiotics are credited with saving tens of millions of lives. Health experts have long warned that their overuse was helping spawn drug-resistant bacteria, and now scientists are seeing an explosion of resistant fungi as well.Another angle: Antibiotics have never been more accessible to the world’s poor, thanks in large part to the mass production of generics in China and India. But in an impoverished community in Kenya, their cheapness and prodigious use have fueled the evolution of deadly infections like salmonella.ImageA Chinese Communist Party member using Study the Great Nation, a new app that critics say is buttressing a cult of personality around  President Xi Jinping.CreditJason Lee/ReutersThe app bolstering Communist controlA smartphone app in China called Study the Great Nation is becoming a potent instrument of control for President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party.Users earn points by staying current on news about Mr. Xi.

5c70fddf3a125f5075c0b24b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/cell-phone-addiction.html,"My name is Kevin, and I have a phone problem.And if you’re anything like me — and the statistics suggest you probably are, at least where smartphones are concerned — you have one, too.I don’t love referring to what we have as an “addiction.” That seems too sterile and clinical to describe what’s happening to our brains in the smartphone era. Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren’t an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock. We might someday evolve the correct biological hardware to live in harmony with portable supercomputers that satisfy our every need and connect us to infinite amounts of stimulation. But for most of us, it hasn’t happened yet.I’ve been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren’t helping. I tried various tricks to curb my usage, like deleting Twitter every weekend, turning my screen grayscale and installing app-blockers. But I always relapsed.Eventually, in late December, I decided that enough was enough. I called Catherine Price, a science journalist and the author of “How to Break Up With Your Phone,” a 30-day guide to eliminating bad phone habits. And I begged her for help.Mercifully, she agreed to be my phone coach for the month of January, and walk me through her plan, step by step. Together, we would build a healthy relationship with my phone, and try to unbreak my brain.‘A Bit Horrifying’ImageOn a video call with Catherine Price, the Marie Kondo of brains.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York TimesI confess that entering phone rehab feels clichéd, like getting really into healing crystals or Peloton. Digital wellness is a budding industry these days, with loads of self-help gurus offering miracle cures for screen addiction. Some of those solutions involve new devices — such as the “Light Phone,” a device with an extremely limited feature set that is meant to wean users off time-sucking apps. Others focus on cutting out screens entirely for weeks on end. You can now buy $299 “digital detox” packages at luxury hotels or join the “digital sabbath” movement, whose adherents vow to spend one day a week using no technology at all.Thankfully, Catherine’s plan is more practical. I’m a tech columnist, and while I don’t begrudge anyone for trying more extreme forms of disconnection, my job prevents me from going cold turkey.Instead, her program focuses on addressing the root causes of phone addiction, including the emotional triggers that cause you to reach for your phone in the first place. The point isn’t to get you off the internet, or even off social media — you’re still allowed to use Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms on a desktop or laptop, and there’s no hard-and-fast time limit. It’s simply about unhooking your brain from the harmful routines it has adopted around this particular device, and hooking it to better things.When we started, I sent her my screen time statistics, which showed that I had spent 5 hours and 37 minutes on my phone that day, and picked it up 101 times — roughly twice as many as the average American.“That is frankly insane and makes me want to die,” I wrote to her.“I will admit that those numbers are a bit horrifying,” she replied.[More from Kevin Roose: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters.]Catherine encouraged me to set up mental speed bumps so that I would be forced to think for a second before engaging with my phone. I put a rubber band around the device, for example, and changed my lock screen to one that showed three questions to ask myself every time I unlocked my phone: “What for? Why now? What else?”For the rest of the week, I became acutely aware of the bizarre phone habits I’d developed. I noticed that I reach for my phone every time I brush my teeth or step outside the front door of my apartment building, and that, for some pathological reason, I always check my email during the three-second window between when I insert my credit card into a chip reader at a store and when the card is accepted.Mostly, I became aware of how profoundly uncomfortable I am with stillness. For years, I’ve used my phone every time I’ve had a spare moment in an elevator or a boring meeting. I listen to podcasts and write emails on the subway. I watch YouTube videos while folding laundry. I even use an app to pretend to meditate.If I was going to repair my brain, I needed to practice doing nothing. So during my morning walk to the office, I looked up at the buildings around me, spotting architectural details I’d never noticed before. On the subway, I kept my phone in my pocket and people-watched — noticing the nattily dressed man in the yellow hat, the teens eating hot Takis and laughing, the kid with Velcro shoes. When a friend ran late for our lunch, I sat still and stared out the window instead of checking Twitter.It’s an unnerving sensation, being alone with your thoughts in the year 2019. Catherine had warned me that I might feel existential malaise when I wasn’t distracting myself with my phone. She also said paying more attention to my surroundings would make me realize how many other people used their phones to cope with boredom and anxiety.“I compare it to seeing a family member naked,” she said. “Once you look around the elevator and see the zombies checking their phones, you can’t unsee it.”[Get more advice from The Times on living a more fulfilling life.

I kept messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal, and non-distracting utilities like cooking and navigation apps. I pruned my home screen to just the essentials: calendar, email and password manager. And I disabled push notifications for everything other than phone calls and messages from a preset list of people that included my editor, my wife and a handful of close friends.[More from Kevin Roose: Is Tech Too Easy to Use?]Where you keep your phone is also important. Studies have shown that people who don’t charge their phones in their bedrooms are significantly happier than those who do. Catherine charges her phone in a closet; for me, she recommended a locking mini-safe. I bought one and started storing my phone inside, which simultaneously reduced my nighttime usage and made me feel like I was guarding the queen’s jewels.And I pursued activities that could replace my phone habit. On the recommendation of my colleague Farhad Manjoo, I signed up for pottery classes. As it turned out, pottery makes a perfect phone substitute. It’s manually challenging and demands concentration for hours on end. It gets your hands dirty, too, which is a good deterrent to fiddling with expensive electronics.After a pottery class, I updated my wife on my progress. I told her that while it felt great to disconnect, I still worried that I was missing something important. I liked having a constant stream of news at my fingertips, and I wanted to do more of the things I actually like about social media, like keeping tabs on my friends’ babies and maintaining ambient Kardashian awareness.“I’m sad that you’re having trouble with this,” she said, “because it’s been great for me.”She explained that since my phone detox started, I’d been more present and attentive at home. I spent more time listening to her, and less time distractedly nodding and mumbling while checking my inbox or tapping out tweets.Psychologists have a name for this: “phubbing,” or snubbing a person in favor of your phone. Studies have shown that excessive phubbing decreases relationship satisfaction and contributes to feelings of depression and alienation.For years, I’ve justified my phubbing by treating it as a professional necessity. Isn’t it my job to know when news happens? Won’t I be neglecting my duties if it takes me an extra hour to learn that Jeff Bezos is getting divorced, or another YouTuber did something racist?I put this question to Catherine, who reassured me that I wasn’t jeopardizing my career by being slightly later to the news. She reminded me that I’d been happier since I dialed down my screen time, and she gently encouraged me to focus on the other side of the cost-benefit analysis.“Think of the bigger picture of what you’re getting by not being on Twitter all the time.”A Thoreau CleansingImageRemember books? They’re like Twitter threads, but longer.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York TimesThe biggest test came with a “trial separation” — a 48-hour period during which I wasn’t allowed to use my phone or any other digital device. (Catherine’s program calls for a 24-hour separation, but I decided to try a more hard-core version.)I had dreaded this idea at the outset, but when the weekend actually arrived, I got giddy with excitement. I rented an off-the-grid Airbnb in the Catskills, warned my editor that I’d be offline for the weekend and took off.A phone-free weekend involved some complications. Without Google Maps, I got lost and had to pull over for directions. Without Yelp, I had trouble finding open restaurants.But mostly, it was great. For two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching back out. I read books. I did the crossword puzzle. I lit a fire and looked at the stars. I felt like Thoreau, if Thoreau periodically wondered what was happening on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Instagram story.I also felt twinges of anger — at myself, for missing out on this feeling of restorative boredom for so many years; at the engineers in Silicon Valley who spend their days profitably exploiting our cognitive weaknesses; at the entire phone-industrial complex that has convinced us that a six-inch glass-and-steel rectangle is the ideal conduit for worldly experiences.Sadly, there is no way to talk about the benefits of digital disconnection without sounding like a Goop subscriber or a neo-Luddite. Performative wellness is obnoxious, as is reflexive technophobia.But I cannot stress enough that under the right conditions, spending an entire weekend without a phone in your immediate vicinity is incredible. You have to try it.[Catch up and prep for the week ahead with the most important business insights.

I now pick up my phone only about 20 times a day, down from more than 100. I still use my phone for email and texting — and I’m still using my laptop plenty — but I don’t itch for social media, and I often go hours without so much as a peek at any screen.In one of our conversations, I asked Catherine if she worried that I would relapse. She said it was possible, given the addictive properties of phones and the likelihood that they’ll only keep getting more essential. But she said that as long as I remained aware of my relationship with my phone, and continued to notice when and how I used it, I’d have gotten something valuable.“Your life is what you pay attention to,” she said. “If you want to spend it on video games or Twitter, that’s your business. But it should be a conscious choice.”One of the most unexpected benefits of this program is that by getting some emotional distance from my phone, I’ve started to appreciate it again. I keep thinking: Right here, in my pocket, is a device that can summon food, cars and millions of other consumer goods to my door. I can talk with everyone I’ve ever met, create and store a photographic record of my entire life, and tap into the entire corpus of human knowledge with a few swipes.Steve Jobs wasn’t exaggerating when he described the iPhone as a kind of magical object, and it’s truly wild that in the span of a few years, we’ve managed to turn these amazing talismanic tools into stress-inducing albatrosses. It’s as if scientists had invented a pill that gave us the ability to fly, only to find out that it also gave us dementia.But there is a way out. I haven’t taken an M.R.I. or undergone a psychiatric evaluation, but I’d bet that something fundamental has shifted inside my brain in the past month. A few weeks ago, the world on my phone seemed more compelling than the offline world — more colorful, faster-moving and with a bigger scope of rewards.I still love that world, and probably always will. But now, the physical world excites me, too — the one that has room for boredom, idle hands and space for thinking. I no longer feel phantom buzzes in my pocket or have dreams about checking my Twitter replies. I look people in the eye and listen when they talk. I ride the elevator empty-handed. And when I get sucked into my phone, I notice and self-correct.It’s not a full recovery, and I’ll have to stay vigilant. But for the first time in a long time, I’m starting to feel like a human again."
5cae904049f0eacbf1f8289a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-privacy-regulation.html,"Two decades ago, at the dawn of the internet age, in an era before smartphones, before apps, before all manner of devices that monitor everything from your car-hailing practices to your dating preferences, the Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy made a startling claim:“You have zero privacy anyway,” he said. “Get over it!”The in-your-face concept had the benefit of being completely prescient and even an understatement. We are now the most data-generating, most uploaded, most share-crazy humans in the history of the world, which means we are also the most monitored, the most data-chomped and, definitely, the most exposed.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Our information — much of it private — is the rocket fuel of the ever-expanding internet. Our data keeps it humming along, even as tech companies abuse that data with increasing frequency.So here’s an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules — rules that have real teeth — on big tech companies.The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.) Others think that current law will suffice, with some tweaking including better enforcement and more money for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector, like the Federal Trade Commission.I would argue that we need both, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company’s top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don’t. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don’t. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.I have said yes too many times before, thanks to the greatest tracking effort in the history of humanity that we facilitate every day by using a smartphone.Let me be clear — I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously. You don’t have to be paranoid to realize that you are being followed, watched and crunched in ways that are breathtaking, and more than a little questionable. We need a national law to signal to these companies that the jig is up and that they need to stop abrogating their responsibilities to their users and to society itself — and I think it’s pretty inevitable we’ll get one in the next few years.At the same time, we don’t want to impose undue burdens on new start-ups or throttle innovation. That’s why I think it would be a mistake to overreact and crack down too hard, as Europe has done in some instances. Europe has put in place strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, the most significant change in privacy law in decades. It gives a lot of power to individuals over how their personal data is collected and used, and is much more punitive when it comes to data breaches. There are also ePrivacy rules there that govern how people can be targeted by advertisers. Some regulations, like the exceedingly complex “right to be forgotten,” would slam right into free speech laws here in the United States. This week, for example, Britain proposed creating a far-reaching regulator to punish tech companies, including their individual executives, for damaging content on their platforms.Europe’s message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else.This punitive and suspicious sentiment had already jumped the Atlantic — all the way across to the Pacific — with California passing its Consumer Privacy Act last year. Less stringent than the General Data Protection Regulation (and criticized by some for being too soft), it makes California-based companies follow stronger data protection rules, including giving the state’s consumers more insight and power over how their data is used and imposing fines when tech platforms don’t comply. The law will go into effect in 2020, and there may be further additions to it. There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo.We have to figure this out now, because more privacy-threatening technologies — such as artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, automation, robotics, self-driving cars and above all, facial recognition — are all part of the next wave of innovation. How the tech giants share data with one another will also be an issue, because the ecosystem is increasingly intertwined.There are some countries that have gone far beyond what Americans would be comfortable with, China being the most aggressive. Beijing has created a surveillance economy that makes our current privacy issues seem trivial. The last thing we want is to get into a race over which country can better stalk its citizens. But we also need to ensure that the version of the internet that was invented in the United States — one based on a principle of openness — is the one that should prevail.Given how much is headed our way, I called Mr. McNealy to ask him if he  felt the same about privacy now as he did in 1999.He said the harvesting of data was unlikely to get any less invasive and noted that the information that is collected about us is like a “digital tattoo” that is impossible to expunge. Nonetheless, Mr. McNealy is not a fan of government regulation. He said that a federal privacy law would be a mistake because it would hinder innovation, and cautioned that the costs of compliance would hurt small companies.He also said that there are still enough alternatives to allow consumers to escape being hostages of Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that if people are concerned about those companies’ data collection, they are free to stop using their platforms. “There is nothing to be done about it but consumer choice,” he said.Besides, Mr. McNealy said, much of the data that is being collected is not actually that dangerous. “Amazon knows that I buy toilet paper, but who cares if it is data that does not matter?” he asked.But at some point, I argued, it does matter. What happens if these companies go too far, and who is to decide how that data is meshed and mixed with other data? Mr. McNealy insisted that current laws, bolstered by antitrust action, should remedy any abuses.“There are plenty of laws to deal with it if, say, Google is reading my email” without permission, he said. “And if these companies do abuse their power by advantaging other parts of their businesses, then regulators ought to have long, hard conversation with them.” Until then, according to the Cassandra of privacy? “I can live without Google, so it does not bother me,” he said.In other words, get over it? I don’t intend to, and I don’t think anyone else should, either. While we may have zero privacy, it doesn’t mean that we have given up our right to control our digital selves. In fact, as tech marches on, that might be the one right that needs to be protected most of all.Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.glossary replacer

5c6b527f3a125f5075c0a52a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/nyregion/nypd-brian-simonsen-christopher-ransom.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]One was an exemplary police officer, a veteran detective with an easy smile, a gift for talking to people and a deep knowledge of the characters in his precinct, on both sides of the law. He had made hundreds of arrests.The other longed to be a police officer when he was young, but evolved instead into the sort of neighborhood nuisance the police often have to deal with. At best quirky, and at worst emotionally disturbed, he amassed a long record of petty crimes, including impersonating a police officer. But recently, the police said, he had started robbing cellphone stores.The paths of the two men crossed at a T-Mobile shop in Queens last week. The veteran detective, Brian Simonsen, was among eight officers who responded when someone spotted a man forcing two employees into the store’s back office with a pistol.Moments later, Christopher Ransom, 27, emerged and pointed what turned out to be a fake gun at officers, jerking it as if he were firing, the police said.For 11 chaotic seconds, the police opened fire. Mr. Ransom and Detective Simonsen were both hit in the police fusillade. Only one would survive the night.“Make no mistake about it — friendly fire aside — it is because of the actions of the suspect that Detective Simonsen is dead,” the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said later that night at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The detective was 42 years old.Sgt. Matthew Gorman was also wounded in the crossfire. Mr. Ransom’s accomplice and lookout man, Jagger Freeman, sprinted away, only to be arrested several days later, the police said.Had they met under different circumstances, friends of the detective said, Detective Simonsen’s skill at calming down troubled people, coupled with Mr. Ransom’s desire to connect with the police, might have led to a less tragic outcome.Instead the Police Department will lay to rest on Wednesday one of its most well-regarded veterans, killed by friendly fire, as Mr. Ransom faces life in prison, charged with causing his death.ImageDetective Simonsen, 42, was mortally wounded by a police bullet.CreditNew York City Police Department‘A cop’s cop’Detective Simonsen, who had spent almost 19 years on the force, did not always want to be a police officer, his friends said. He felt a calling to help people through traumatic times, driven in part by the untimely deaths of his father and sister during his high school years.He grew up in Riverhead on Long Island and studied social work at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, where he also played catcher for the school’s baseball team. He worked in the social services field briefly before deciding to enter the New York Police Academy.Law enforcement proved an excellent fit for an athletic and affable man interested in psychology. Detective Simonsen began his career patrolling the 102nd Precinct in October 2000.He was among the first to respond to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with Officer Terrence LeGrady. It was an ordeal that made the patrol partners inseparable. Years later, Detective Simonsen would buy the house next to Officer LeGrady’s in eastern Long Island.In 2006, Detective Simonsen joined the precinct squad, where he became an expert on robbery cases.He and his partner at the time, Kevin O’Hea, were a fixture in the second-floor detective offices at the precinct, known for trading friendly banter with other officers and planning outings to Mets games.He spent his entire career in the 102nd Precinct, where he made 569 arrests and brought more than 130 felony indictments to the Queens district attorney’s office.His colleagues said he had a knack for convincing suspects to confess and for bonding with victims.“He had a very good way of putting people at ease,” Tim Shortt, an assistant district attorney in the Queens office, said of Detective Simonsen.In one case, Mr. Shortt recalled, Detective Simonsen was assigned to investigate a robbery that left a victim with a broken jaw. Detective Simonsen succeeded in getting one of the suspects to confess and to incriminate his partner. He then coaxed a confession out of the partner and had the man confirm his identity by signing the back of his own wanted flier.“He didn’t need a rubber hose to play a tough guy,” Mr. Shortt said. “He would have suspects laughing in the lineup room. He always acted decently toward them.”Even in cases where he had DNA evidence confirming a theory and a witness identification of a suspect, Detective Simonsen and his partner made a habit of trying to obtain a written confession.“We’d go talk to the guy because we felt like we needed him to tell us he did it,” said Mr. O’Hea, who retired in 2014.Though he loved the job, Detective Simonsen, who was a union delegate, had told friends he planned to retire soon if he did not receive a promotion to detective second-grade, a rank he had been nominated to receive.For younger officers in the precinct, Detective Simonsen was an anchor. One officer described him as “a cop’s cop.”“He knew the neighborhood, all the good guys, all the bad guys,” the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to a reporter. “Whether you’re a rookie or you’re a senior guy, he treated you the same. You always wanted to talk to Brian.”ImageDetective Simonsen and his wife, Leanne, visiting the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center in 2013.Creditvia Terrence LeGradyA police family on Long IslandThat reputation as a community pillar extended to Calverton, Long Island, where Detective Simonsen had settled with his wife Leanne, after meeting her on a trip to Las Vegas with mutual friends.Their neighborhood parties were legendary, including a particularly large bash Detective Simonsen threw last year for his grandfather’s 100th birthday.Detective Simonsen opted to make the 70-mile commute into the city rather than leave Long Island, where he played softball in the Riverhead police league.Though Detective Simonsen and his wife never had children, they kept the fridge stocked with snacks for the neighborhood kids. He had recently given his childhood baseball mitt to Officer LeGrady’s son, who also loved the game. His friends’ children called him Uncle Brian.His sister-in-law, Michelle Quinn, said Detective Simonsen had a deep love not just for his wife, but for her entire family in Chicago, which includes several police officers. “It was so easy to see the love between him and my sister,” she said.Ms. Quinn recalled how she had once admired her brother-in-law’s New York Islanders sweatshirt during one of his trips to Chicago. After he returned to New York, she found it in her house.“He left it for me, with a note,” she said. “Truly gives you the shirt off his back.”“The guy robbing the store,” Ms. Quinn added, her voice breaking. “Brian would have bought him a cellphone. He would have put him on his plan.”ImageA picture Christopher Ransom, 27, posted on his Facebook page a few hours before the Feb. 12 robbery that led to Detective Simonsen’s death. Mr. Ransom, who was shot eight times during the police response, is charged with murder.‘He would go a little cuckoo’In the days since the shooting, police officials have described Mr. Ransom as a career criminal. For those who knew him, that description is not wrong, but does not tell the whole story, either.Mr. Ransom has been in and out of trouble with the law since 2010, with 25 arrests as a juvenile and an adult. Still, his adult criminal record does not include any violent crimes or involve weapons. His most serious convictions were for shoplifting. His other convictions were for actions that were more bizarre than menacing.“That’s what was kind of mind-boggling to me, to even see that he was in that situation,” said Larry Davis Nedd, a deacon at Brooklyn’s New Grace Tabernacle Christian Center, where he knew Mr. Ransom in his young-adult years.Friends, family and longtime neighbors of Mr. Ransom described a man of contrasts, prone both to deep displays of charity and to intense flashes of instability. He had trouble finding work.The one constant in his manic existence was a fascination with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, they said. Since he was a boy, Mr. Ransom had desperately wanted to become a police officer, recalled Frank Rios, a lifelong friend. But Mr. Rios said questions about Mr. Ransom’s mental health kept him from pursuing the job.Mr. Rios was not the only associate of Mr. Ransom’s who recalled emotional and mental health problems. Neighbors of Mr. Ransom’s mother in Ocean Hill, who had adopted him out of foster care, recalled her frustration with his tendency to act out in odd ways. She had taken him to counseling and had gotten him medication, one neighbor, Clemente Williams, said.“He wouldn’t take his meds and his mother would say he would go a little cuckoo,” Ms. Williams said. “He seemed to be an all-right guy but a little off.”Mr. Ransom’s sister, Patricia Rush, 46, also recalled that Mr. Ransom took medication for a mental condition as a child and was supposed to continue taking it into adulthood, though she did not recall what disorder he had. “He is supposed to be on medication right now,” she said.Quirks that appeared innocent in childhood grew darker and more serious as Mr. Ransom matured. After he failed to pursue a career as a police officer, he went to peculiar — and sometimes illegal — lengths to make inroads in the city’s justice system. He was prone to wearing fake policing gear in public. He donned it one morning in 2016 as he tried to nonchalantly enter Brooklyn’s 77th Precinct offices.Wearing a tactical vest and a fake badge that read “Super Police,” Mr. Ransom tried to gain access to restricted areas of the building. He was arrested, convicted of impersonating a law enforcement officer and spent 20 days in jail.Mr. Ransom was also convicted in 2012 of fraudulently claiming to be a college intern in order to gain access to restricted areas of the Kings County courthouse, including judges’ chambers.He was later convicted of criminal trespass and issued a protective order that forbade him from contacting two judges in the building. Court records show he violated that order the following year.In recent years, Mr. Ransom’s behavior spiraled erratically. He left his church, moved out of his old neighborhood and became estranged from friends and family, including his sister. Known as a prankster in childhood, Mr. Ransom began engaging in stunts aimed at gaining notoriety on the internet, his sister said. He posted some of his antics on his YouTube channel, tagged under “Christopher Ransom Productions.”In one 2016 post, Mr. Ransom can be seen wearing nothing but underwear and a cape, walking into a police station and thanking officers for their service.ImageMr. Ransom visiting a police precinct dressed as a superhero.CreditChristopher Ransom TV, via YouTube“I love you guys and I appreciate the N.Y.P.D,” he said, before leaping toward the exit.Whatever aspirations Mr. Ransom had in his youth, there were signs in recent days that he had abandoned hope of a normal life. On Jan. 17, he took to Facebook to voice frustration. “It took me 27 years to realize that I’m not a job type of dude,” he wrote.Two days later, the police said, Mr. Ransom was caught on a security camera as he robbed a cellphone store in Jamaica, Queens, holding a black handgun similar to the fake one he dropped when he was shot on Feb. 12.On Feb. 8, Mr. Ransom teamed up with Mr. Freeman, 25, to rob a T-Mobile store in the St. Albans neighborhood, brandishing a firearm and making off with about $1,000 and 25 iPhones, according to a criminal complaint.ImagePolice officers leaving Jamaica Hospital Medical Center on Feb. 12 after Detective Simonsen’s body was transported to the medical examiner’s office.CreditStephen Speranza for The New York TimesA tragic shootingMr. Ransom’s last social media update, posted the afternoon of Feb. 12, is a photo of himself in a trench coat, leaning against a bar with a bottle of Hennessy cognac. There is no description or caption.Five hours later, as rain and sleet coated the streets of Richmond Hill, Queens, Mr. Ransom and Mr. Freeman arrived in a car at the T-Mobile store on Atlantic Avenue at 120th Street, the police said. Mr. Ransom went in while Mr. Freeman stood watch outside, according to a criminal complaint.Just a few blocks away was Detective Simonsen, who had decided that night to go out on a shift, even though he had attended a union meeting earlier and was not required to work. He was eager to continue investigating a pattern of robberies with his supervisor, Sergeant Gorman, the police said.It was supposed to be a quiet night, polishing up reports and preparing for an upcoming review from headquarters. Neither the detective nor the sergeant were wearing bulletproof vests, the police said.Still, when the report came over the radio at 6:09 p.m. of a robbery at the T-Mobile store, the pair responded. They arrived at the same time as a patrol car.Sergeant Gorman, as the highest-ranking officer at the scene, entered the shop with two patrol officers to confront Mr. Ransom, who had already stuffed a duffel bag with cash. He had taken two employees into the back room of the store and demanded that they open a safe containing iPhones, when officers entered, according to police officials and two criminal complaints.Mr. Ransom came out of the back room holding up an authentic-looking imitation of a Colt pistol, court papers said. He advanced toward the door as officers backed out of the shop. As he approached the door, he raised a gun and made a motion to shoot.Police would later determine that the ensuing eruption of gunfire was from seven officers firing 42 bullets. Eight of them hit Mr. Ransom, who fell inside the store, his fake gun nearby. One wounded Sergeant Gorman in the thigh. Another mortally wounded Detective Simonsen, striking his vest-less chest.Twenty-four hours later, Mr. Ransom, who once dreamed of becoming a police officer, would be accused of causing the death of one. Mr. Ransom and Mr. Freeman have both been charged with murder.And from Chicago to the eastern reaches of Long Island, the beloved officer’s friends and family members would be struggling to grasp how a quiet night went so horribly wrong.“Brian was such a fun jokester, I’m hoping somehow it’s a big joke,” Ms. Quinn, his sister-in-law, said.“Just know he was the best.”"
5c3717b73a125f5075c03b20,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/earnings-season-stock-market-outlook.html,"It’s time to see the numbers. Investors are about to get a read on the health of corporate America, as businesses begin releasing quarterly profit reports and laying out expectations for the coming year.The results may resolve a roaring debate on Wall Street that has pitted economists, who have argued that the economy remains healthy, against investors, who pushed stocks to the brink of a bear market over concerns that growth is waning. “As we hear from more companies about how the year ended, we’ll get more color on which side has a better feel, the economics community or the equity community,” said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. On the whole, the numbers are expected to be solid. Analysts estimate that, when all the results are in for S&P 500 companies, fourth-quarter profits will have risen 15 percent over a year earlier. That would be the fifth-straight period of double-digit profit growth, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. It doesn’t guarantee investors will be happy. The last round of results, which began to arrive in October, showed even faster growth but did little to stem the stock market’s rapid sell-off at the end of the year.That’s in part because Wall Street is looking ahead: how factors like a global slowdown and rising interest rates will affect future profits. Next week will bring results from banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as companies like Delta and Netflix. On Thursday, cautionary statements from Macy’s and American Airlines weighed on their shares and those of other department stores and airlines.Here are some of the questions investors will be seeking answers to as they weigh whether they went too far with the sell-off. Will China’s slump hurt America’s businesses?For much of 2018, investors were surprisingly willing to shrug off risks posed by the trade war that erupted between China and the United States, the world’s two largest economies.But as the dispute has dragged on, and stretched from its original focus on America’s yawning trade deficit with China to seemingly intractable questions over technological and geopolitical dominance, it’s starting to take a toll.China’s economy is showing signs of weakness, and that’s bad news for companies that count the country as a major market. How Companies Like Apple Sprinkle Secrets in Earnings ReportsJan. 10, 2019Apple recently slashed its sales forecast for the first time in 16 years, citing weak sales of iPhones in China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a decade. The South Korean giant Samsung — a huge producer of both smartphones and semiconductors — similarly cut its profit outlook, citing weak global growth. And the impact isn’t limited to tech. Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany have all noted weakness in China as a risk in recent months.Furthermore, it isn’t just China. The slowdown is rippling through other economies. Germany’s industrial engine, which exports high-end autos and industrial equipment to China, is sputtering and dragging on European growth, and Japan’s economy — the world’s third largest — contracted in the third quarter. What’s the mood of American consumers?For companies that aren’t heavily exposed to foreign markets, the outlook for domestic consumption, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of America’s economic activity, is what matters. On that front, the news is still mostly good.Last year consumer sentiment measures showed Americans to be largely inured to a noisy political and economic climate. There are good reasons this resilience could continue. Wages are rising, gas prices have fallen, and Americans who stand to benefit from the Trump administration’s tax overhaul could start to see higher tax refunds roll in over the coming months. “It’s tough to again have a recession when consumers are getting more money from tax refunds and oil prices are lower,” said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Companies have confirmed that view. In its earnings report last month, Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, noted that consumers were splurging, adding to their entrees and “buying up.” “Right now, we think the consumer is in a really good place,” Eugene Lee, Darden’s chief executive, said on a conference call after the company’s earnings release. Still, stock market moves typically lead consumer sentiment, meaning December’s sharp sell-off could take some of the fizz out of the mood of American shoppers. Even after a recovery in the early days of 2019, the S&P 500 remains more than 10 percent below its September peak. The federal shutdown could also dampen spirits. Previous episodes of government dysfunction, such as the 2011 fight over raising the debt ceiling and the 2013 government shutdown, were associated with sharp drops in consumer confidence. What’s the impact of rising wages and other costs?For large employers, rising wages will cut into profits unless they find a way to get customers to pay higher prices. A plan by Amazon to pay a $15 hourly wage to its 250,000 employees in the United States — as well as roughly 100,000 seasonal workers — is expected to take a significant chunk out of its profits. In November, TJX Companies, the parent of retailers like Marshalls, T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods,  all of which appeal to consumers because they keep prices low, also offered cautious guidance for the fourth quarter in the face of rising labor and shipping costs.Wages aren’t the only things rising. Increasing commodity prices, transportation costs and interest rates are typical conundrums for corporations in latter stages of an economic expansion. The emergence of those pressures on corporate profits is one reason investors have grown increasingly worried about stocks.Will executives sit on their hands? Executives don’t mind paying more for wages, raw materials and shipping if sales keep rising as the economy continues to grow. But if the outlook darkens, executives will be quick to snap their wallets shut. The American economy still looks strong. More than 300,000 jobs were created in December. Unemployment remains below 4 percent. Through the third quarter, the economy was on track for its best annual performance since 2005. Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the EconomyNov. 20, 2018Still, uncertainty about what’s to come could dissuade some decision-makers from pulling the trigger on new investments in real estate, plants and equipment. Such capital spending is crucial to keeping the economic expansion on track, making any broad pause in spending a potential pitfall for growth. There are signs that the outlook is becoming increasingly murky. While reporting earnings on Wednesday, the homebuilder Lennar said it couldn’t offer investors a forecast for 2019 because of “continued softness and uncertainty” in the housing market, which has been squeezed by rising mortgage rates. Such comments, as well as any mentions of plans to delay production or expansion plans, will be of intense interest to investors this earnings season both for the individual companies involved and for the possible impact of those decisions on the American economy. “That could itself lead to a future slowdown,” said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays."

It was his first for the fashion house.CreditPierre Guillaud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhen most people think of the word “designer,” they think of Karl Lagerfeld. They think of his dark glasses and his weird little white powdered ponytail and his stiff white shirts and his black jeans. They think, maybe, of his black fingerless gloves and his silver Chrome Hearts jewelry. They think of his outrageous or amusing pronouncements, his grand gestures and his obsession with his cat, Choupette, who is one of his heirs. They think of Mr. Lagerfeld’s silhouette, which appeared on everything from dolls to Coke cans. When it came to ubiquity, it wasn’t quite George Washington on the 25-cent coin, but it was close.They probably think of all this even if they don’t know the Chanel or Fendi labels where Mr. Lagerfeld worked, or remember seeing Nicole Kidman and Pharrell Williams in his clothes, or realize that Anna Wintour wore custom-made Chanel each year when she hosted the Met Gala, in pictures that went around the world.[See Karl Lagerfeld’s final collection for Fendi here.]Six Decades of Karl Lagerfeld24 PhotosView Slide Show ›ImageJean-Luce HuréIf they are fashion people, of course, they may think of more. They may think, perhaps, of the outrageous flower arrangements he used to send, bigger than anyone else’s (he did everything bigger than anyone else), and the scores of handwritten notes. They may think of his work, which ranged from the awkward (Chanel snowboards and boxing gloves) to the sublime (an “eco-couture” show that was an ode to the natural world, wherein he somehow managed to use wood as a fabric).They may think, of course, of the show sets: the iceberg, trucked in from Sweden and then trucked back again; the supermarket; the rocket ship. If they have long enough memories, they may think of the fan that was once his signature accessory.But whoever they are, there is little doubt that over five decades, through presence and attrition and volume and a willingness to put himself out there — through sheer force of mind, maybe — Mr. Lagerfeld became the emoji in everyone’s mind that stood in for the job. He died on Tuesday in Paris, Chanel announced.As much as all the work, and the model for how to revive a heritage house the way he did with Chanel, that is what he gave us: an image of what “designer” means. Now, of course, the job has changed. Designers have become creative directors or chief creative officers, and they are fluent in ROI and SKU. But that wasn’t Mr. Lagerfeld. ImageKarl Lagerfeld, center, flanked by Virginie Viard and his godson, Hudson Kroenig, in December at the Chanel Métiers d’Art show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.CreditEvan Agostini/Invision, via Evan Agostini/Invision/APRather, he was the man with the sketch pad, erupting with ideas in the ivory tower of material artistry, and we forgave him his trespasses in the name of the muse. Or muses.Because, let’s be honest, he trespassed a lot.He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown. He said mean things about Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whom he drew hanging out with Hitler; the actress Meryl Streep, whom he falsely accused of asking for money to wear a Chanel dress to the Oscars; and the singer Adele, whose weight he criticized. Three years ago, when I ran into him not long after a Gucci show in which Alessandro Michele, deep into his much-heralded reinvention of the brand, had referenced the somewhat obscure French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, Mr. Lagerfeld rolled his eyes and snorted and said, “Do you think he knows Gilles Deleuze?” The implication being that he, Mr. Lagerfeld, did not think so — because “I know Gilles Deleuze.” Of course he did.Karl Lagerfeld, Designer Who Defined Luxury Fashion, Is DeadFeb. 19, 2019Karl Lagerfeld Is Remembered by Designers, Celebrities and Business TitansFeb. 19, 2019Karl Lagerfeld, Remembered by His Friends and CollaboratorsFeb. 19, 2019He spent what seemed like let-them-eat-cake amounts of Chanel’s money on his sets during the global recession (though he also helped preserve and show off the work of the specialty ateliers — like the feather and embroidery houses — which easily could have been lost to history and industrialization). He judged and knew he would be judged himself, but he didn’t care. Rather, he embraced it.This was a man, after all, who invented the haute fourrure show for Fendi — one full of clothes that were mind-blowing in their intricacy and invention — when fur itself was going determinedly out of fashion. Let the animal rights campaigners drive blood-spattered vehicles outside the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées while, inside, he took three standing ovations. He had no interest in being politically correct. At least when he was upsetting people, they weren’t bored.It’s a strange thing to say, in the context of the multiple collections, the insane productivity, the omnivorous curiosity, the endlessly erudite references, the acres of satin and chiffon made glorious over the years, but one of the most extraordinary things about Mr. Lagerfeld may have been that he never apologized.In all the hagiography that happens after a death, it should not be glossed over. Not just because it was part of who Mr. Lagerfeld was, in fully resplendent and sometimes ugly humanity, but because it is part of what marked him out as belonging to a different time.Karl’s World23 PhotosView Slide Show ›ImageValerio Mezzanotti for The New York TimesIt was a time in which proclamations were issued and edicts handed down from on high. It was before “dialogue” or “co-design” or any of the things we now consider the wave of the future, and before the constant stream of mea culpas issued on social media, where brands and individuals seem to be endlessly wrong-footing themselves. Mr. Lagerfeld didn’t want to go to business meetings or be bothered with quarterly reports or budgets. Often, it didn’t even seem like he had a budget. Or if he did, he ignored it (which is partly why he was the envy of so many other designers).He prized the “freedom” — his word — of being left in his own world, with his atelier and his muses and his books and his Birman and his imagination and his ideas. He may have been heralded as a paragon of fashion modernity with his iPhone and his 300 iPods (this is, after all, an industry in which some chief executives still don’t use email), but in this, at least, he was resolutely old-fashioned.It may be what we really mean when we say that his death signals “the end of an era.” It is the end not just of his reign, or that of his professional generation (Yves, Valentino and Co.), but of a certain idea that has lived in the public mind, far beyond the fashion sphere, of what it means to be a designer.He outlasted almost all of his peers, who were lost along the way to the pressures of the changing industry, or disinterest in the spotlight, or the current conventional wisdom that 10 years is the longest any person should be in charge of a brand not his own. But even though Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, called him “immortal,” soon we may all find that in fact, Mr. Lagerfeld really was the last of his kind."
5c85445d49f0eacbf105c4fe,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/business/electric-cars-geneva-auto-show.html,"Geneva — After years of promising electric cars, established carmakers are actually starting to build them.But manufacturers are realizing that a shift to battery power also requires them to retool their sales machinery. The old come-ons are obsolete. Range is the new horsepower. Connectivity replaces cylinder count. And sustainability is the new status symbol. Volvo’s Polestar 2 electric car, unveiled last week, even comes with a leather-free “vegan” interior.The need for carmakers to win over a public still hesitant about buying a car that needs half an hour or more to recharge is becoming more urgent as electric vehicles move closer to mass production.Battery-powered rides like the BMW i3, Nissan Leaf and Tesla’s lineup have been available for years. But this once-niche category is now expanding at a breakneck pace.ImagePolestar, which is positioning itself as a separate brand from Volvo, staged the unveiling of the Polestar 2 as if it were a new version of the iPhone.CreditSamuel Zeller for The New York TimesThere are dozens of new electric cars on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, which opened to the public on Thursday and continues through March 17. These are not concept cars that may never be for sale, as tended to be the case at previous shows. They are vehicles with familiar brand names that you will be able to buy this year or next.An electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year. Volkswagen is refitting a German factory to build a battery-powered car that, beginning in 2020, will sell for about the same price as a Golf.Audi, a unit of Volkswagen, showed nothing but battery-powered vehicles and hybrids at the Geneva show. Renault, one of the first companies to offer electric cars, is renewing its lineup. Volvo skipped the show in order to leave the stage to its all-electric Polestar.“2019 will be a decisive year for electromobility,” Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief executive, said at a company event in Geneva.It’s also a moment of truth for the traditional automakers, which have long argued that their decades of experience in manufacturing will allow them to avoid the start-up problems suffered by Tesla and to dominate the next wave of automotive technology.ImageVolvo’s Polestar 2 electric car, displayed at the Geneva auto show, comes with a leather-free “vegan” interior.CreditSamuel Zeller for The New York TimesTesla’s financial woes, which have prompted it to shutter retail stores and lay off 7 percent of its work force, may prove them right. But it remains to be seen whether the entrenched carmakers can generate the same energized fan base.The key to selling any product is differentiation, making your car seem cooler and more capable than all the others. Long ago, it was V-8 engines, six-speed automatic transmissions, and the actor Ricardo Montalbán caressing the “soft Corinthian leather” seats of a Chrysler Cordoba.But a lot of the features that set conventional cars apart, like fast acceleration, quiet interiors and smooth handling, are pretty much standard with electric cars.While gasoline engines need at least a few seconds to gather momentum, batteries deliver instant pep. Electric motors make very little noise. And battery packs, heavy and usually spread out beneath the passenger compartment, provide a low center of gravity and help glue an electric car to the road.Automakers also need to prevent their models from becoming commodities as the whole idea of car ownership is under attack by Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies.ImageCharging the Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid. An electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year.CreditSamuel Zeller for The New York TimesOne way Volvo and others are trying to answer the upstarts is by importing a bit of Silicon Valley vibe, even if their engineers are in Sweden or Stuttgart. Polestar, which is positioning itself as a brand separate from Volvo, staged the recent unveiling of the Polestar 2 as if it were a new iteration of the iPhone.Thomas Ingenlath, the chief executive of Polestar, bounded onto a stage in Gothenburg, Sweden, wearing a mustard-colored zip-up jacket over black slacks and a T-shirt and white sneakers.Polestar is “redefining premium for the electric age,” Mr. Ingenlath said, standing in front of a giant video screen. His presentation, broadcast online, was heavy on the car’s digital features, including an 11-inch touch screen and Google voice recognition software that allows drivers to summon driving directions or call up a tune from Spotify.A United States version of the Polestar 2 will go on sale early next year, initially in California and Washington State, for about $63,000. (The Polestar 1, a performance hybrid, has just begun rolling off a Chinese production line.) Dealerships will be small retail spaces in city downtowns, and some may be pop-up stores.When Mr. Ingenlath got to the part about the Polestar 2’s vegan interior, he showed an image of cows looking content, presumably because they were not fated to become car seats. “I will spare you now the video of mass production of leather,” Mr. Ingenlath said, somewhat darkly.Ricardo Montalbán, who died in 2009, may not have been a fan, but the pitch underlined the carmakers’ assumption that electric car buyers will skew green.The primary motivation of a customer who wants an electric vehicle “is being friendly to the planet,” Olivier Murguet, executive vice president for sales at French carmaker Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.But, he added, electric vehicle customers pay close attention to the same things as other car buyers, like the purchase price.Electric cars continue to cost thousands of dollars more than conventional vehicles. High price remains an obstacle, mostly because of the cost of the batteries. That may be less of a problem than it seems. Electric vehicles already on the road are holding on to their value well, Mr. Murguet said. That allows carmakers to offer attractive leasing terms because they know the cars will command a good resale price when the lease expires.European customers can lease a Renault Zoe, a two-door battery-powered subcompact, for 150 euros a month, or $170. “Even if the price of the cars is higher, the amount to finance from a customer’s perspective is not that much more,” Gilles Normand, senior vice president for electric vehicles at Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.ImageEuropean customers can lease a Renault ZOE, a two-door battery-powered subcompact, for 150 euros a month, or $170.CreditSamuel Zeller for The New York TimesAnd many buyers of electric cars won’t be individuals, but car-sharing services that buy them by the dozens and can spread the cost among more users. Those buyers tend to pay attention to the cost of a car over its life span rather than just the initial purchase price. Electric cars look better from that angle because they don’t require oil changes and electricity is cheaper per mile than gasoline.“The whole business case is changing for all of us,” Chris Delaney, president of Europe for tire maker Goodyear, said as he sat in a self-driving electric shuttle van on display in Geneva. (Goodyear is supplying specialized tires for the vehicle.)While electric vehicles account for only about 5 percent of Goodyear’s current sales, Mr. Delaney said, they account for 40 percent of new business from manufacturers — an indication of how fast demand is rising. Electric cars pose a design challenge for tiremakers as well. The cars’ high weight and fast acceleration require a more robust tire.The open question is whether any of the established carmakers, who still make most of their money from conventional vehicles, can generate buzz as effectively as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. Despite all of Tesla’s problems, Mr. Musk commands widespread respect in the industry for transforming the image of electric cars from nerdy science projects to desirable performance vehicles.So far, no other car manager has demonstrated Mr. Musk’s ability to make Tesla the center of the conversation, though not always in a good way.“Tesla did a lot to build up the market for electric cars,” Detlev von Platen, head of sales and marketing at Porsche, said. “We have a lot of respect for what they accomplished. They’re a reference for us.”"

Melissa Eddy, a Berlin correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech she’s using.What are the most important tech tools for doing your job, and how do you use them?My iPhone X has become my multipurpose portable notebook, camera, recorder and connection device. I have typed breaking stories into the Notes app and sent them to editors, or jotted down key points from an event, when I found myself without pen and paper.I’ve used the camera to record Facebook Live video, but also to take still photos of anything that catches my imagination when I am out reporting, or signs that I don’t have time to stop and translate. When I sit down to write, I go back through my photos to jog my memory, although I sometimes worry that it would be better to pause and capture the thought in the moment.I use the VoiceMemos app to record news conferences and in-person interviews. For phone interviews, I rely on TapeACall Pro, which is easy to use and has been a great addition.Because many Germans use Android phones, I installed WhatsApp initially to keep in touch with my friends and kids. But increasingly, it is a popular way to communicate with sources. When we were reporting on the more than one million migrants who made their way to Germany in 2015 and 2016, most of them still had cellphones from their home countries, and the only way to reach them was via WhatsApp messages, or “Whatsies.”ImageGermans tend to be very conscious of online privacy, and Ms. Eddy said she had turned off Apple’s FaceTime after its privacy scandal.CreditMustafah Abdulaziz for The New York TimesGoogle Maps, a German railway app and a local car-sharing app make up my essential travel tech trio. As a nation obsessed with keeping a paper trail, Germans were very cautious about using apps to make everyday transactions easier — Apple Pay arrived only at the end of last year — but the apps are catching on. It has been several years since I used a paper ticket on the train, and where car-sharing services like DriveNow initially required an extra card to unlock the car, now all I need is my phone.Is there any tech that you’ve stopped using lately or use less, and why?I have turned off Apple’s FaceTime after the latest scandal over privacy, but I only ever used that to reach my 80-year-old father, who isn’t on WhatsApp.For years, I have been a lurker on Facebook and would like to quit it altogether, but I find it too useful for reporting. About 32 million of Germany’s 82 million people are active on the platform. Some members of Germany’s far-right and nationalist circles, including some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, use Facebook almost exclusively to communicate with their base, so it has become increasingly useful for tracking their activities.Germany has a reputation for being very privacy-conscious online. How have you seen that manifest itself?Many public records are protected in Germany by strict privacy laws, which means that access in general is difficult and that records are not at all available online. The country still demands that applications for most official documents take place via paper or fax. Digital databases of information on individuals do not exist.Searching for places in Germany on Google Street View returns a patchwork of images and blurred blotches. That’s because in 2010, data privacy activists succeeded in forcing Google to allow them to render their residences unrecognizable. The irony is that Germans, who like to head into vacations hyper-prepared, love to look up their hotels or the cities they will visit on Google Street View.Nothing in the Berlin public school system is digitized, and parents have to sign special waivers for their kids to have access to Wi-Fi in the schools that offer it. At the start of every school year, parents have to give permission for their email addresses to be shared on a class list, and those who don’t will be left out.ImageBerlin's Mitte neighborhood. Using Google Street View to find places in Germany can be tricky because data privacy activists forced Google to allow them to blur their residences.CreditMustafah Abdulaziz for The New York TimesThat being said, Germans in their 20s and younger are as active on Instagram or Facebook as their counterparts in the United States. Yet despite being raised in a privacy-obsessed country, they seem to struggle with the idea that whatever they publish on Facebook can be seen publicly, unless they take special action to keep their entries private.After the 2017 terror attack on a disco in Istanbul, I reached out to a group of friends of one of the victims from southern Germany. They had posted homages to him, and I wanted to use them and perhaps talk to them about their friend. But my attempts to reach out were met with hostility that I would be invading their privacy and “preying” on their mourning — which they had made publicly available on Facebook.What apps and gadgets do Germans love to use? Germany’s highly mechanized society seems to extend even to the act of cleaning teeth: Germans love electric toothbrushes. Young kids are started on smaller, battery-powered brushes, which become larger and more sophisticated as they grow.

To be on the safe side, the taxi companies quickly realized they needed to create an app or eventually be left behind, so MyTaxi was born. It works the way Uber does elsewhere, but by connecting riders with taxis wherever they are in Germany — even in tiny towns where the local taxi driver has to be pulled off his sofa in front of the TV to come pick you up at the station at some odd hour.

5c633bfb3a125f5075c09583,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/movies/high-flying-bird-nba-history-netflix.html,"Steven Soderbergh’s electrifying new film “High Flying Bird,” which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players’ personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.)The film’s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), is also replete with references to the game’s history — not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There’s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide.What were the all-black leagues?As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment.The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called “Black Fives” by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance — or, as they were better known, the Rens — were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead.[Read the Times review of “High Flying Bird” by A.O. Scott.]ImageAbove, from left: Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton of the Harlem Globetrotters, George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers, Babe Pressley and Slater Martin in a 1950 game.CreditCharles Knoblock/Associated PressHow did the Harlem Globetrotters help spur integration?Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game.As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in “High Flying Bird”: “There’s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.”ImageClifton in 1951, after he joined the New York Knicks.CreditRobert Kradin/Associated PressHow did the N.B.A. integrate?Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball’s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.)Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was “no comparison,” he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball.ImageFrom left, Maurice Evans; Derek Fisher; the head of the players’ association, Billy Hunter; the N.B.A. Commissioner, David Stern; the deputy commissioner, Adam Silver; and the San Antonio Spurs owner, Peter Holt, announcing an agreement to end the 2011 lockout.CreditPatrick Mcdermott/Getty ImagesWasn’t there an actual N.B.A. lockout?Yes — in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of “High Flying Bird,” the sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland) tells a client, “Last time this happened, folks was broke left and right!” That “last time” was the 2011 lockout, which lasted  five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players.A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day.What about those exhibition games?Much screen time in “High Flying Bird” is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film’s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a “lockout street ball event in Las Vegas,” presumably inspired by the “lockout league” in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun.

The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already “forcefully questioned the league’s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.”Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. “My past,” she told players while making her case for the job, “is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.”ImageTommie Smith, center, and John Carlos, right, at the 1968 Olympics.

Edwards first came to national prominence for organizing the Olympic Project for Human Rights, whose members Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines for raising their gloved fists while receiving medals at the 1968 Olympics.Edwards has spent the ensuing years teaching, writing, consulting and leading protests. “Revolt,” published in 1969, argued that racism is as prevalent in sports as in any other section of society. “The sports world is not a rose flourishing in the middle of a wasteland,” he writes. “It is part and parcel of that wasteland, reeking of the same racism that corrupts other areas of our society.”ImageThe folk singer Richie Havens in 2009.CreditEvan Agostini/Associated PressWhat’s the story behind the music?“High Flying Bird” is bookended by recordings of two folk-rock classics, both performed by Richie Havens as part of his opening set at Woodstock. The title track, Havens’s recording of a folk song written by Billy Edd Wheeler, was praised by the musicologist Richie Unterberger for its “arresting minor-keyed melody and brooding lyrics, contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer’s earthbound misery.” It isn’t hard to connect those lyrics to Ray’s notion that his clients should free themselves from the earthbound constraints of the sports industry and bring the game back to its roots.“Handsome Johnny,” which Havens wrote with the Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., closes the film, telling the story of a young man who marches off to a series of wars. Given the movie’s themes, the song’s refrain is appropriate: “It’s a long hard road, hey, before we’ll be free.”"
5c84149749f0eacbf105c3b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/opinion/sunday/immigrants-refugees-names-nguyen.html,"LOS ANGELES — What’s your name? Mine is Viet Thanh Nguyen, although I was born in Vietnam as Nguyen Thanh Viet. Whichever way you arrange my name, it is not a typical American name. Growing up in the United States, I was encouraged by generations of American tradition to believe that it was normal, desirable and practical to adopt an American first name, and even to change one’s surname to an American one.Of course, that raises the question — what exactly is an American name?When my Vietnamese parents became American citizens, they took the pragmatic route and changed their names to Joseph and Linda. My adolescent self was shocked. Were these the same people who had told me, repeatedly, that I was “100 percent Vietnamese?”They asked me if I wanted to change my name. There was good reason for me to change my name, for throughout my childhood my classmates had teased me by asking if my last name was Nam. As in “Viet Nam.” Get it? The autocorrect function on the iPhone certainly thinks so, as I still sometimes get messages — from friends — addressed to Viet Nam.I tried on various names. I did not want anything too typical, like my Catholic baptismal name, Joseph. Or Joe. Or Joey. I wanted something just a little bit different, like me. How about — Troy?It didn’t work. That name, or any of the other contenders, seemed alien to me. My parents’ constant reminder that I was 100 percent Vietnamese had worked its magic. I felt some kind of psychic connection to Vietnam, the country where I was born but that I remembered not at all, having left at age 4. This psychic tie was ironic, because my fellow Vietnamese refugees in San Jose, Calif., of the 1980s — who never called themselves Americans — would describe me as completely Americanized. A whitewash. A banana, yellow on the outside, white on the inside.If I were indeed a banana, many other Americans probably just saw the yellow part and not the soft whiteness inside. The dilemma of being caught in between opposing cultures was hardly new and has not gone away, but it was still difficult for me and everyone else who has had to experience it.I was hardly reassured when I went on a field trip to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey and a pleasant young white American soldier, dressed in Vietnamese garb and fluent in Vietnamese, translated my Vietnamese name into a kind of American equivalent: Bruce Smith.The Smith part was a good translation, as Nguyen is the most common Vietnamese surname, inherited from a royal dynasty. In Australia, where many of the refugees went, Nguyen is among the most common surnames. I wonder if the Australians have figured out how to pronounce my name in all of its tonal beauty. In the United States, most Vietnamese-Americans, tired of explaining, simply tell other Americans to say the name as “Win,” leading to many puns about win-win situations.As for Bruce, I think George might have been more accurate. Viet is the name of the people, and George is the father of the country. Or maybe America itself should be my first name, after Amerigo Vespucci, the cartographer whose first name — Americus in Latin — has become a part of all our American identities.Or maybe, instead of contorting myself through translation — which comes from the Latin word meaning to “carry across,” as my parents carried me across the Pacific — I should simply be Viet.That, in the end, was the choice I made. Not to change. Not to translate. Not, in this one instance, to adapt to America. It was true that I was born in Vietnam but made in America. Or remade. But even if I had already become an American by the time I took my oath of citizenship, I refused to take this step of changing my name.Instead, I knew intuitively what I would one day know explicitly: that I would make Americans say my name. I felt, intuitively, that changing my name was a betrayal, as the act of translation itself carries within it the potential for betrayal, of getting things wrong, deliberately or otherwise. A betrayal of my parents, even if they had left it open to me to change my name; a betrayal of being Vietnamese, even if many Vietnamese people were ambivalent about me. A betrayal, ultimately, of me.I render no judgment on people who change their names. We all make and remake our own selves. But neither should there be judgment on people who do not change their names, who insist on being themselves, even if their names induce dyslexia on the part of some Americans. My surname is consistently misspelled as Ngyuen or Nyugen — even in publications that publish me. In Starbucks and other coffee shops, my first name is often misspelled by the barista as Biet or Diet. I have been tempted to adopt a Starbucks name, as my friend Thuy Vo Dang puts it, to make my life easier. Hers was Tina. Mine was Joe. I said it once to a barista and was instantly ashamed of myself.Never did I do that again. I wanted everyone to hear the barista say my name. Publicly claiming a name is one small way to take what is private, what might be shameful or embarrassing, and change its meaning. We begin at some place like Starbucks, which is itself an unusual name, derived from a character in “Moby Dick,” itself an unusual name. Starbucks and Moby Dick are a part of the American lexicon and mythology. So can all of our names, no matter their origins, be a part of this country. All we have to do is proudly and publicly assert them.Recently I visited Phillips Exeter Academy, a once all-white institution founded in 1781 whose population is now about 20 percent Asian. In front of the entire student body, a student described how he dreaded introducing himself when he was growing up and made up nicknames for himself so that he would not have to explain his name’s pronunciation. He asked me what I would say to people struggling to hold on to their names.“What’s your name?” I asked.“Yaseen,” he said.I told him that his name was beautiful, that his parents gave it to him out of love. I told him about the name I gave my son, Ellison, whom I named after the novelist Ralph Waldo Ellison, who was named after Ralph Waldo Emerson. I claimed for my son an American genealogy that was also an African-American genealogy that, through me and my son, would also be a Vietnamese-American genealogy. Ellison Nguyen, a name that compressed all of our painful, aspirational history as a country.America, too, is a name. A name that citizens and residents of the United States have taken for themselves, a name that is mythical or maligned around the world, a name that causes endless frustration for all those other Americans, from North to South, from Canada to Chile, who are not a part of the United States. A complicated name, as all names are, if we trace them back far enough.Yaseen. Ellison. Viet. Nguyen. All American names, if we want them to be. All of them a reminder that we change these United States of America one name at a time.Viet Thanh Nguyen, a contributing opinion writer, is the author, most recently, of “The Refugees” and the editor of “The Displaced: Refugee Writers on Refugee Lives.” He teaches English at the University of Southern California.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c7d81c349f0eacbf105b496,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/business/ai-technology-travel-planning.html,"At the Expedia Group product testing lab, facial recognition software gauges travelers’ feelings as they go through the process of booking hotel rooms online. The Swiss cruise company MSC Cruises is starting to use a virtual assistant to answer passengers’ questions. Designers from the boutique design and research firm the Gettys Group can show hotel executives new room layouts using virtual reality goggles, so hotels don’t need to build a full-scale model.Travel companies are adopting artificial intelligence and other new technologies to look more deeply into what customers want and to use that information to find faster, cheaper ways to improve their offerings. And as sophisticated research tools become less expensive and more widely available, even start-ups in the industry are using them.Competition in every aspect of the travel sector is extremely stiff, and travel companies “need these mechanisms to reach their target markets,” said Alex Susskind, associate dean of academic affairs at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration.“They need to know who wants to see pictures before they buy, who decides mainly on price, who likes to speak to someone” and why, he said.Tammy Snow, the director of user experience research at Expedia, said researchers still use product testing, customer surveys and data analysis. “What has shifted significantly,” she said, “is how we are combining technology and methodologies.”In Ms. Snow’s product-testing lab at Expedia headquarters in Bellevue, Wash., travelers test aspects of online travel purchasing, sitting down in front of a computer in a small room and going through the process of booking a flight or planning a vacation. In a room next door, researchers and members of the product creation team watch a large video screen that displays what the test subject is doing and a scrolling readout of the subject’s reactions, generated by software that plots points on that person’s face and then uses a coding system to identify the person’s emotions.Eye-tracking software shows observers where on the screen the subject is looking.If test subjects are showing rising frustration as they scroll through a long list of hotel choices but not seeing any they like, researchers can ask them what they are thinking.The emotion tracker “highlights the severity of an issue in a visceral manner” and lets product design teams see the frustration, Ms. Snow said. Similar research is done with customers in Europe and Asia.Alex Hopwood, a director of product management at Expedia, said it helped to get an outside perspective. “We get so close to a feature that we start making assumptions and think we know what the customer wants,” he said. Seeing how a real traveler uses the website and reacts to it “is almost like a slap in the face — in a good way.”Scott Wainner, chief executive of Fareness, a 15-person start-up that lets travelers compare flight prices from a specified departure point to a set of destinations like European cities or beaches, said feedback tools were now affordable even to small travel companies. Internet-based services like Usability Hub and UserTesting.com allow companies to test different aspects of a product, showing two navigation screens to a sample set of users, for example, to see which they prefer. Testers, who have been chosen based on their demographic profile, answer questions online or record themselves on video doing the task and giving feedback.ImageBradford Summers, a researcher, looks for a cabin online to show how information is captured from test subjects at the Expedia Group lab. He can be heard through an audio system as well as seen on a computer screen and through the mirrored glass.CreditRuth Fremson/The New York TimesThrough user testing, Mr. Wainner said, he found that his customers were most interested in learning about the cheapest flight, the shortest flight and the flight that offered the best combination of saving time and money. Displaying search results based on this information, even though the changes were small, made a big difference in sales, Mr. Wainner said. He noted that the company “didn’t have to set up our own internal testing facility” to get that information.Website analytics software has been improving both in the amount of data it collects and in the ways it makes that data understandable and useful. Fareness.com uses Mixpanel, a tool that helps analyze trends like the number and demographics of Mr. Wainner’s customers who view company ads, explore the site and book airline tickets. Using Mixpanel, he said, he can, for example, test different messages focused on customers using a specific iPhone operating system or living in a certain region of the country, or compare actions of repeat customers in different demographic groups.Some travel companies are creating systems that themselves generate research. MSC Cruises is rolling out a virtual assistant in passenger cabins called Zoe that will answer spoken questions. It can improve its answers with continual research based on the interactions it has.Zoe was programmed to answer the 800 most common questions — queries about excursions or onboard restaurants, for example — and variations of those questions in seven languages. The questions were gleaned from staff members and from data collected from the ships’ guest services desks. To work with an international clientele, the system “listened” to 400 people and improved its ability to understand different accents.If a passenger needs to ask the same question repeatedly in different ways, that indicates the system didn’t understand the passenger’s meaning the first time. Questions that Zoe can’t answer will be sent as a text to researchers who can add appropriate answers to the system’s next iteration.“It’s a never-ending process,” said Luca Pronzati, chief business innovation officer of MSC Cruises. “As more people use the system, the pool of data gets larger and we do better.”Booking.com, an Amsterdam-based online travel agent, is incorporating similar learning into its hybrid chatbot, Booking Assistant. The assistant currently answers about 60 percent of users’ post-booking queries, like hotel checkout times or Wi-Fi availability. It also loops in humans when it can’t find the appropriate answer, the company said.The chatbot improves its repertoire much as the Zoe system does, adding questions that staff have tagged and answered. James Waters, vice president for commercial operations at Booking.com, said that the company was expanding its offerings beyond hotel room reservations to transportation and leisure bookings, so more customers would need answers to more questions.“The system is a blend of technology and human help,” he said.New tools are helping hotels as well. Professor Susskind of Cornell said large hotel companies were always working on improving their room designs, looking at such things as a sliding door for the bathroom to save space or making showers larger and closets smaller based on consumer preferences. Often that can mean building a full-scale model, but new technology can help designers and hotel management look at the options in a less expensive way.Meg Prendergast, a design principal for the Chicago-based Gettys Group, said, “More than ever, clients are open to have our team design their spaces using virtual and augmented reality systems that allow them to experience designed space before it is actually built.” They can also see how different materials, like wood or stone floors, would look. Using virtual reality research, design adjustments can be easier to make and cost efficient, she said.Professor Susskind said that traditional marketing in the travel industry had evolved: “You run the risk of not being able to compete effectively in the marketplace without these enhanced approaches.”"
5cafa22c49f0eacbf1f830c6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/technology/uber-ipo-filing.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber, the ride-hailing service that has upended transportation around the world, took a major step toward the largest initial public offering in years when it officially unveiled its finances in a prospectus on Thursday.The offering, which could value Uber at around $100 billion, is expected to reverberate through global financial markets and to solidify the company’s position as one of the most consequential technology firms of the past decade. The share sale would be the biggest since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, and would peg Uber’s value at more than four times that of United Airlines’ parent and double that of FedEx.But the prospectus renewed questions about how sustainable Uber’s business actually is. The company said in the filing that it lost $1.8 billion in 2018, excluding certain transactions, on revenue of $11.3 billion. And the prospectus also showed that its rocket-ship trajectory for revenue growth was beginning to slow.Uber’s archrival in North America, Lyft, went public last month at a valuation of $24 billion. But Lyft, which is also deeply unprofitable, fell below its offering price in its second day of trading as investors questioned whether it could make money. This week, Pinterest, the digital pin board company that also is losing money, set a price range for its public offering that values it below that of its last private market peg.[Comparing Uber and Lyft, in four charts.]One potentially major concern for Uber is that it does not appear set to turn a profit in the near future. In the United States, the company is burning cash as it battles Lyft, cutting prices for passengers and spending to recruit drivers. In other parts of the world, Uber also provides discounts to riders and incentives to drivers as competitors like Ola fight for market share. And the company is investing heavily in businesses like food delivery and scooters.“We will not shy away from making short-term financial sacrifices where we see clear long-term benefits,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, wrote in a letter accompanying the prospectus.To lessen the surprise of its losses when it did finally go public, Uber has disclosed its quarterly results for two years even though, as a privately held company, it was not obligated to do so. Still, the prospectus invites new scrutiny.[Here is a glossary to help make sense of Uber’s jargon.]Uber did not disclose in the filing the valuation it is seeking from public investors; it was last valued at $76 billion in the private market. Its offering is being led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The company’s shares are set to begin trading next month on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UBER.In its filing, Uber said it made a profit of $997 million in 2018, largely from selling parts of its business in places like Southeast Asia and Russia. Excluding those gains, plus other items, Uber lost $1.8 billion for the year. In 2017, its net loss totaled $4 billion.Revenue growth also slowed. In 2018, its revenue rose 42 percent to $11.3 billion from a year earlier. But revenue in 2017 had more than doubled from 2016. Uber revealed in the prospectus that it is heavily dependent on just five cities for nearly a quarter of its total bookings: Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, London and São Paulo, Brazil.Its number of monthly users, who turn to Uber for not only rides but also services like food delivery, was 91 million in 2018, up 34 percent from a year earlier. But user growth, which had risen 51 percent in 2017, also slowed.At the same time, Uber’s spending continues to rise, reaching $14.3 billion last year, up 19 percent from 2017.While revenue growth in its ride-hailing business slowed, its food delivery service, Uber Eats, is soaring. Revenue from Uber Eats nearly tripled to $1.5 billion in 2018 from $587 million a year earlier.Who’ll Get Rich When Uber, Pinterest and Other ‘Unicorns’ Go PublicSome of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.Founded by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick in 2009, Uber began as an on-demand black car service for wealthy clients, riding the wave of mobile-technology innovation that followed Apple’s introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Mr. Camp conceived of the service, initially called UberCab, because of the difficulties he had hailing a taxi in San Francisco.Silicon Valley tech workers were quick to embrace Uber, but it wasn’t until around 2013 that the service took off more broadly. That year, Uber introduced UberX, a low-cost ride-sharing service that allowed anyone with a car and a license to drive for the company on a freelance basis. UberX was a hit, and the company expanded rapidly elsewhere, often by flouting local and state transportation laws.Under the leadership of Mr. Kalanick, who was chief executive, Uber also increased its footprint internationally. It now operates in more than 63 countries and 700 cities around the world. Uber completes more than 15 million trips a day.Amid its explosive growth, the company stumbled in 2017 when a series of legal and ethical scandals resulted in a boardroom coup that led to Mr. Kalanick’s ouster. After trying to regain power for months, Mr. Kalanick has since moved on to a new start-up, City Storage Systems, which is focused largely on real estate.Uber acknowledged the toll of what unfolded in 2017 in its prospectus. The company said it lost hundreds of thousands of users in just a few days during a #DeleteUber social media campaign that year. It said it still suffered from a perception that Uber is a toxic place to work. And the company continues to deal with investigations by the Justice Department and foreign government agencies over its past business practices.Since late 2017, Uber has been led by Mr. Khosrowshahi, a former chief executive of Expedia. The company has expanded beyond its original ride-hailing mission and is experimenting with scooters, bike-sharing and other alternative forms of transportation. It has also invested in Uber Eats and is beefing up Uber Freight, its long-haul-trucking division.“What began as ‘tap a button, get a ride,’ has become something much more profound,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said in his letters.The company has tried stemming some of its losses, including by selling some of its businesses in China, Russia and Southeast Asia. It recently acquired Careem, its primary rival in the Middle East, for $3.1 billion, partly to help ease a fierce price competition in the region. It has also sought new investment from the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank to support its development of autonomous vehicles.Uber has also had to answer persistent questions about the status of its drivers, who as independent contractors are ineligible for employee benefits like health care. That saves Uber money.The company said in its prospectus that the possibility it may someday be forced to recognize its drivers as employees was an existential threat to its business. “Any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model,” Uber said.More than 60,000 drivers have filed or told Uber that they intend to file arbitration cases against the company, claiming that they were misclassified as independent contractors, the company said.The company said in its filing that it intended to award cash bonuses to more than 1.1 million drivers in the United States. The bonuses range from as little as $100 up to $10,000, based on how many trips the driver has completed. Drivers will be able to use the bonuses to purchase Uber stock at its I.P.O. price.The biggest winners from Uber’s public offering will be its founders and early investors, who own large chunks of company stock. According to the prospectus, the biggest shareholders are SoftBank, which owns 16 percent of Uber; the venture capital firm Benchmark, which owns 11 percent; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which owns 5 percent; Alphabet, which owns 5 percent; and Mr. Kalanick, who owns 9 percent.Eric Paley, a managing partner at Founder Collective, a venture firm that invested in Uber in 2010, said the company would inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs to change any industry.“Uber was started in the depths of the financial crisis, catered to a then-non-existent market, and still, in the space of a decade, has changed the way cities work across the globe,” he said."
5cb20da749f0eacbf1f83c49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/us/mohamed-noor-trial-minneapolis.html,"MINNEAPOLIS — Their lives intersected only briefly at the end of a dark alley: a meditation coach clutching a glittery iPhone and a Minneapolis police officer sitting in the passenger seat of a black-and-white Ford Explorer.The meditation coach, Justine Ruszczyk, who had spent most of her life in Australia, was unarmed and barefoot, wearing pajama pants and a pink T-shirt with the image of a koala. She had heard someone screaming and was nervous enough to have called 911 twice.The policeman, Mohamed Noor, whose arrival as his precinct’s first Somali-American officer had been celebrated months earlier by the mayor, answered the call. He didn’t find anyone yelling, and told dispatchers that everything was fine.But a few seconds later, just before midnight, Ms. Ruszczyk was dying on the ground, a single bullet from the officer’s service weapon lodged by her spine, her body sprawled beside the police car.The death of Ms. Ruszczyk on a July night in 2017 shook Minneapolis — protesters marched, the police chief was fired, the mayor was soon voted out — and renewed debates about body cameras and when police officers use force. It also led to a persistent question that still haunts Ms. Ruszczyk’s family and the city: What happened?After nearly two years, many details of the shooting remain a mystery. There is no audio recording. No video. And Officer Noor, who is standing trial this month on murder and manslaughter charges, has never given a public account of his actions. Amid the uncertainty, dueling narratives have emerged, along with questions of equity and fears that the truth might never be known.ImagePosters of Ms. Ruszczyk were displayed at a news conference by lawyers for her family in 2018.CreditAmy Forliti/Associated PressA voice in the alleyMs. Ruszczyk was home by herself on a Saturday night when she heard a noise coming from behind her house. It sounded like a woman in distress. “I’m not sure if she’s having sex or being raped,” Ms. Ruszczyk told a police dispatcher, adding that she thought she had just heard the woman yell out: “Help!”The noise was out of place in the Fulton neighborhood, an affluent, low-crime area near the southwestern edge of Minneapolis. Ms. Ruszczyk, 40, had moved there from Australia a couple of years earlier to live with her fiancé, Don Damond, who was away that night on a business trip.Ms. Ruszczyk, who was a dual citizen of Australia and the United States, had thrived in Minnesota, where she sometimes went by the name Justine Damond. She helped find homes for unwanted pets. Her life-coaching and meditation instruction business had grown. And her wedding in Hawaii was just weeks away, close enough that her dress was purchased and her hotel was booked.All through that day, July 15, she and Mr. Damond exchanged texts and calls while he was in Las Vegas for work, swapping emojis and complaining about the summer heat. “Night XO!” Mr. Damond texted her just after 10 p.m. “I love you,” she replied.More than an hour later, past the time she was usually asleep, Ms. Ruszczyk called her fiancé back. When he did not answer, she called back twice more. She told him about the strange noises in the alley. They agreed that she should dial 911.“We just didn’t know what was happening,” Mr. Damond recalled later. “But I also had a sense that we had called the right people — we had called the police.”‘Unknown trouble’It was a quiet night in the Fifth Precinct, and Officer Noor and his partner, Officer Matthew Harrity, were about two-thirds of the way through their shift.ImageThe Fulton neighborhood is an affluent, low-crime area near the southwestern edge of Minneapolis.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesAfter a series of unremarkable assignments and a quick dinner break, dispatchers sent them to the alley behind Washburn Avenue South for what was deemed a relatively low-priority call: “unknown trouble: female screaming.”For Officer Noor, who is married and has a child, policing was a third career. After graduating from college and working as a hotel manager, then a health benefits analyst, he entered the Minneapolis police academy. He was sworn in as an officer in 2015, on his 30th birthday.Officer Noor, whose family fled Somalia’s civil war when he was just a few years old, had been celebrated as a potential bridge between the Police Department and the large East African population in Minneapolis. He was part of both groups — a refugee who moved to Minneapolis, became a United States citizen and chose public service. Betsy Hodges, the mayor at the time, called his hiring “a wonderful sign.”At the entrance to the alley, Officers Noor and Harrity flipped off the headlights on their cruiser and rolled down their windows. Neither officer turned on his body camera. They crept forward, scanning the alley with a spotlight, hearing little more than the whining of a dog.Officer Noor entered “Code Four” into the cruiser’s computer, meaning the scene was safe. They were about to leave.One shotBack inside the house, Ms. Ruszczyk spoke on the phone with Mr. Damond as she waited for officers to arrive. Their conversation ended abruptly: “She said, ‘O.K., the police are here,’” Mr. Damond recalled.What happened next remains a murky combination of settled fact, competing claims and unexplained mystery. Had Ms. Ruszczyk run outside to flag the officers down and startled them? Had she knocked on the back of the car to stop them from driving off? Had the officers mistaken the cellphone she was holding for a weapon?ImageMohamed Noor, center, is standing trial on murder and manslaughter charges.CreditAdam Bettcher/ReutersOne thing was certain: Officer Noor then fired a bullet in front of his partner, through the rolled-down driver’s window of the Explorer, and into Ms. Ruszczyk’s chest.Officer Harrity, who did not fire his gun and is not charged with a crime, has said he heard a loud noise and sensed a figure approaching the cruiser on his side of the car. “We both got spooked,” he told a supervisor.Officer Noor, who has since been fired by the Police Department, has never spoken with investigators about what happened or why he pulled the trigger. His silence is a rarity: Police officers involved in shootings, including the relatively few who are ultimately charged with crimes, almost always tell their account of what happened to their police departments.The uncertainty has left people reaching their own conclusions, often disparate ones that have created new rifts on top of old ones. In Australia, where gun violence is comparatively rare, the case stirred outrage. In the tree-lined Fulton neighborhood of Minneapolis, it remains a source of anger.“I can’t imagine what Justine was doing or would have done that would cause Officer Noor to go from zero to shoot in such a short period of time,” said Todd Schuman, who lives about a block from Ms. Ruszczyk’s home, and who is part of an activist group that pushed for charges against the now former officer.But others said they believed the charges in the case of Ms. Ruszczyk, who was white, revealed a double standard when it comes to such prosecutions.“I do not believe that if the victim had been Somali or a person of color, that this officer would have been charged,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer who used to lead the Minneapolis N.A.A.C.P., and who protested the police shootings of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, both of whom were black.ImageSigns and flowers at the end of the alley this month, almost two years after the shooting.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesOmar Jamal, a consultant and activist, said there was a widespread sense among Somali-Americans in Minnesota that Ms. Ruszczyk’s death was a tragedy, but that this officer was being treated differently than a white officer would.“There’s a feeling that they threw the book at him hoping that something would stick,” Mr. Jamal said. “They were surprised that he was even charged with a crime.”Uncertain is whether former Officer Noor, 33, will take the stand and tell his side of the story during his trial, which is expected to go on for days.On Tuesday, a glimpse of his account emerged in the cramped courtroom. In an opening statement, Peter Wold, one of his lawyers, told jurors that Officer Noor heard a bang and saw Officer Harrity grasping for his gun, in terror, just before the shooting.“Noor drew his gun to protect his partner and himself,” Mr. Wold told jurors.Officer Noor quickly fired. Mr. Wold said his client acted reasonably after being startled and seeing his partner panic. Mr. Wold alluded to other instances of police officers being called to secluded areas, finding nothing amiss and being attacked.“It was a perfect storm with tragic consequences” but “not a crime,” said Mr. Wold, who acknowledged that Ms. Ruszczyk had in fact posed no threat.Prosecutors described the shooting as something else: a murder with no reasonable explanation.“He fired that shot,” said Patrick Lofton, a prosecutor, “without saying a word.”"
5c3869263a125f5075c03e2f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/well/family/myself-by-any-other-name.html,"I had a chunk of myself removed last month.“Think of it as a marble in your sheet cake,” the oncologist said.That marble was a tumor in my liver, a serious situation, but at least I was a candidate for surgery. Recovering in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, having just been filleted, solar plexus to navel, I exhaled into the plastic spirometer that measured my airflow. It felt like a miniature version of that strong man carnival game in which you pound a mallet to try to ring a bell. Meanwhile, there was the quotidian task of managing my children’s calendars from my iPhone while texts, emails and Facebook messages flooded in, well-wishers checking up on how I was recovering.When I messaged my ex-husband to ask if he could take our daughter to a birthday party, his reply popped back and there it was: his name, which is my name, too. Just as in elementary school choir: John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. Except our name was Chang.I thought about the liver surgery team fellow who did a double take in the pre-op room. He was looking for Pari Chang. He looked at the sign on the door that said “Chang” and looked at me, the non-Asian patient, and began walking away. “Hold up,” I’d called out. “You have the right room! My ex-husband is Chinese.”“I was wondering,” he confessed, laughing. In a paper gown, with no makeup or jewelry and wearing my glasses (no contact lenses for patients headed to the O.R.), my last name felt like an accessory.Post surgery, exchanging texts with my ex over kid-logistics, I considered the decision I had made 17 years earlier to take his Chinese surname. At the time, this traditional, wifely move felt radical to me because it signaled that I was part of a mixed-race couple. Back then, at 27, I was experiencing some self-consciousness about my own origins. My father was a successful small business owner — a meatpacker — and though my parents were street smart and financially secure, to me, their know-it-all, bookish daughter, they seemed unrefined. I was eager to marry into my husband’s clan, a family of scientists and calligraphers, of professors and gourmet cooks. “Chang,” symbolized the reinvention of myself from Jersey Girl to pan-cultural sophisticate.A line from the Lorrie Moore novel “A Gate at the Stairs” resonated for me: “I’d always been opposed to a woman taking her husband’s name, but when I changed mine, I suddenly knew the relief in such an act.”Through the divorce, I held on to my married name like a tether to the family I’d made. Chang was on my driver’s license, my passport, and my children’s birth certificates. You come to own your name just as you own your own body. It is the skin of you, your packaging, your label and your presentation. I was channeling Erica Jong, another Jewish writer who’d divorced a Chinese man and kept his surname. Plus, it felt right to have the same last name as my kids.“No one believes you’re my mom,” my almond-eyed son said once at camp pickup, wounded confusion in his voice. But the name was the proof.Yet, recovering in the hospital, battling the Big C — and preposterously negotiating the chaperoning of a roller-skating party — I was fiercely determined to survive, which took reconnecting to my essential self. Frankly, the whole fact of this cancer, a malignancy in my colon that later metastasized to my liver, felt inconceivable. I was young and fit, only in my 40s, but apparently part of the medical conundrum du jour, the sharp uptick of colorectal cancer diagnoses in Americans under 50.My Grandma Sooky would have had a psychological explanation for the target organ of my illness. “You’re eating your kishkes out over this divorce,” she’d have said, kishkes being Yiddish for intestines, or guts. Perhaps that old-world thinking contained a kernel of wisdom.Jack, my partner of six and a half years, had long observed that I hadn’t wholly let go of my ex. He was right, evidenced by the fact that I had kept his name. In the midst of my cancer recurrence, Jack and I married. We felt an urgency to make our love official. As a bonus, he had excellent health insurance. On our wedding day we sandwiched our visit to City Hall between a PET scan and a consult with a liver surgeon. I was literally radioactive when we said our “I do’s,” but I would have been glowing anyway.The irony is, I never once considered taking Jack’s last name. I don’t think it crossed his mind, either. The young woman I once was, seeking otherness and urbanity, a striver with class insecurities, had evolved into a stalwart mother in New Jersey, raising her kids in her hometown with their grandma. The mettle it took for my parents to muscle into the middle class turned out to be my lucky inheritance. The woman Jack married is her parents’ daughter, Pari Berk.Home from the hospital, I made the name change Facebook-official and the likes poured in. Yet, when I broke the news to my 9-year-old daughter, she cried, and my 12-year-old son, in typical preteen fashion, sulked and gave me the silent treatment. No doubt news of yet another change was disconcerting to them during a month of uncertainty. I circled back to the kids separately a few hours later, though, and they seemed to soften, both uttering some version of, “It’s up to you, Mom.”Lately, my son has been especially snuggly. My little girl has taken to leaving me inspirational messages on her chalkboard. “You’ll be OK,” my favorite one begins. “You will fight through this with all you can and with hope and determability, you can do … ANYTHING.”Cancer can be a killer, but it can also be a clarifier. Changing my name back to Pari Berk feels like a kind of self-affirmation. It roots me. I lost a chunk of myself in December, but I reclaimed a piece, too.Pari Berk is a lawyer and writer who is completing a memoir."

Each week in our newsletter, you’ll hear from college students and recent graduates about issues going on in their lives. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Before I arrived to Stanford my freshman year, I had imagined the type of life I would have on campus. Movies about college made me think that hookups and one-night stands would be the norm.I wasn’t totally wrong. Freshman orientation featured students telling us about their sexual experiences on campus, and throughout the year, resident assistants lined the hallways of our dorms with bowls of free hard candy and condoms. It all seemed to be part of a mission to help students make educated and safe decisions about sex. It also made me feel a little weird for not partaking.The bowls in the halls, which gradually emptied out, were reminders that I was an odd one out. Whatever the truth was about the sex culture in college, it sure looked like everyone else was having a lot more fun than I was.Of course, I’m not actually the only college student who doesn’t have sex. I spoke with several students who are choosing to be abstinent. They had a range of reasons for not having sex, including busy schedules, past experiences with sexual violence, and, yes, religion.A few years ago, New York Magazine and SurveyMonkey polled more than 700 college students about their sex lives. Almost 40 percent of the survey respondents said they were virgins, and 41 percent of the women and 49 percent of the men considered themselves sexually inactive. It doesn’t always feel that way. It can seem like the expectation is that we’re all doing it, maybe because people talk so openly about sexuality.“It’s not like I feel pressured,” said Avery Jacobson, who attends Humboldt State University in Calif., about choosing whether to have sex. “It’s just kind of everywhere.”For some students, like Catherine Pham, a sophomore at the University of California, Los Angeles, attempts to be open and inclusive about sexuality can miss the mark by failing to reflect the range of choices we can make with our bodies.“Sex positivity is a scam,” Ms. Pham said. She said the movement tends to embrace people who are having sex, “whereas not being sexually active is considered not liberating.”As for me, I’m now in my sophomore year and I’m still not having sex, the way I define it. At this point in my life, the act of exposing my body in any way makes me feel vulnerable. My anxiety often stops me from continuing intimate conversations that might lead to sex, and like many students, my schedule makes me feel like I don’t have the time to work through these issues, either.I’m comfortable with my choice, but it’s still tough to see sex come so naturally to other people. I always want to ask how they do it. Obviously not how, but I want to know if they had to overcome the kind of barriers that are stopping me.Maybe I’ll understand it one day, maybe I won’t. For now, I’m cool with spending my nights alone.What We’re ReadingHow to Actually, Truly Focus on What You’re Doing Tired: Shallow work. Wired: Deep work.Why It Could Be Hard to Mute R.

I recognize that when we are pursuing goals or dreams there are inevitable setbacks, obstacles, struggles. How do you differentiate between when the struggle is something to overcome or push through versus when it is a signal to stop or alter the path you are currently on?We invited Nicole Phillip, live interactive news editor at The Times, to weigh in. Here’s what she said:Even after spending most of my life in Orlando, when it came time for college I wasn’t ready to leave. I decided to go to college around the corner from my childhood home after getting accepted to schools around the country. After my freshman year, I transferred to New York University to see where my ambitions could take me.Like you, I’m now miles away from everything I grew up with and unable to find the same community I once had. But humans are made to adapt and we are stronger than we often think.For me, I learned to be alone and not lonely. I allowed myself to enjoy my own company when I didn’t always click with the people around me — going on solo movie dates, table-for-one dinners and even international trips.I also know what it’s like to not be doing what you thought you’d be doing after graduating. After all, you’re supposed to go to school, get a degree, and find a job doing exactly what you wanted, right? That’s not how it always works.When I graduated, I had temporary positions outside of what I thought I should be doing for about two years. I pushed through and kept making connections with people in my field until I finally landed my first fully production role that carried me through to where I am now.It might help if you continue to remind yourself what you went there to do — why you left the comfort of your own backyard — and let that reminder bring you through this struggle.It’s also worth acknowledging that no matter how hard we try, things may never take that positive turn we hoped for, and that’s just life. As long as Future You will be able to look back and know you were doing the best you could and trying to make smart decisions, I don’t think you’ll live in regret.Navigating college and the years afterward can be tough, but we’re here to help!

5ca7747649f0eacbf1f812f3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/opinion/mass-incarceration-sentencing-reform.html,"The United States spends far too much money locking up far too many people for far too long.A few years ago, a politician had to be brave to say anything like that out loud. Now it’s a mainstream and bipartisan view. In a 2018 survey conducted for the American Civil Liberties Union, 59 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to support than oppose a candidate who supports reducing the prison population. Achieving that goal is now an accomplishment that politicians showcase. In December, Congress by wide margins passed the First Step Act to reduce some drug sentences and improve conditions in federal prisons. President Trump, despite painting a frightening picture of crime-ridden “American carnage” at his inauguration, invited the first drug offender released as a result to the State of the Union address.It’s all pretty head-spinning after decades of elected officials competing to lock more people up and spotlight the scariest crimes. Now, with public opinion shifting far and fast and politicians hurrying to catch up, you could even argue that criminal justice reform has become the new marriage equality in terms of the turnaround in public attitudes.That presents a major opportunity for Democratic presidential candidates. But for all the energy behind reform, no presidential candidate has articulated a big, comprehensive vision for transformational change. There’s a consensus that the system is broken, but no agreement on how to fix it.The presidential candidate seeking to distinguish herself might start by looking at a new wave of reform-minded district attorneys who are challenging conventional law-and-order approaches in red states and blue ones.For the candidates, thematically, a starting point should be that wealth should not determine a person’s fate in court, and profit should not drive the system. Bail bonds, privatized probation and corporate-run prisons are parasitic features of the justice system. Ending cash bail should be at the top of every candidate’s criminal justice agenda. So should getting rid of fines and fees that help fund local governments but trap people in cycles of debt.Ferguson, Mo., became a symbol of the criminalization of poverty for routinely sending black defendants to jail for failing to pay minor traffic fines. But last November, a new district attorney, Wesley Bell, was elected. On his first day in office, he announced one of the most progressive bail policies in the country — pretrial release, without bail, for misdemeanors and some felonies, unless the prosecutor thinks there is a direct threat to public safety. Mr. Bell also said his office would no longer seek to revoke probation for unpaid fines and fees. “As an overriding principle, I do not believe in prosecuting poverty,” he told a weekly newspaper, The St. Louis American.The old Ferguson lives on elsewhere. In Texas, 524,000 people were jailed in 2018 for unpaid traffic tickets. Even short stays for nonviolent offenses can wreak havoc with people’s jobs and child care. Sparing them needless punishment matters for their lives. To end mass incarceration, however, exempting nonviolent offenses from jail time isn’t enough. People convicted of violent crimes make up more than half of the country’s state prison population. But the image of prisons overflowing with murderers and rapists is wrong. In many states, “violent felonies” include offenses like breaking into an empty house or snatching a purse or iPhone on the street. Reducing sentences for these offenses — and changing what counts as a violent felony to begin with — can lower this share of the prison population.And that fits in with a second theme for candidates: People deserve a second chance, because many grow and change. They robbed to feed an addiction and then got sober. They assaulted someone because they were mentally ill and then got treatment and stabilized. They mature as they age beyond their teens and early 20s. That’s why it makes sense to reconsider how long a person should stay in prison after doing some time.At last, a few prosecutors are doing this and are moving to correct the heavy sentences handed down in the past. The elected prosecutor in Seattle, Dan Satterberg, has won 21 commutations or resentencings for people serving life or decades. Three of the people released — brothers — are back in prison for new crimes, including one for a killing, but the other 18 are “taking full advantage of their freedom,” Mr. Satterberg put it. “Our obligation to do justice continues to go backward as well as forward,” he said. “Yes, we'll have failures, but one way to manage that is more re-entry support for people.” Parole offers another opening for second chances. In Texas, says Scott Henson, an activist who blogs at the site Grits for Breakfast, “our parole rates have gone from 15 percent to the high 30s in the last decade,” He said the increase is “having more impact than any bill we’ve passed even through the legislature.” He thinks the reason for the rise is a humdrum logistical one: The state unofficially uses parole as a way to reduce prison overcrowding. We should also focus on redefining the terms of the public safety debate. Ending mass incarceration, and ensuring fairness throughout the criminal justice system, aren’t in tension with public safety. It is integral to it. People tend to uphold the law when they believe it’s reasonable and applied evenly. When people have that faith, they are more likely to help the police solve crimes. With  only about 60 percent of murder cases resulting in arrest or other resolutions — that percentage is even lower for other crimes — disillusionment may be our biggest safety threat. After Baltimore’s district attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced in January that her office would stop prosecuting marijuana possession, a group of mothers whose children were killed in the city mounted a mobile billboard. “Stop Pot Arrests,” it read. “Solve Murders Instead.”In a comprehensive new blueprint for reform, the Justice Collaborative, a nonprofit group, makes an underappreciated and crucial point: “Law enforcement is not the only, or even the most important, answer to addressing cycles of violence.”Adam Foss, president of Prosecutor Impact, which conducts training for prosecutors, said politicians can be explicit about this approach: “If you’re serious about tackling violence, you talk about how to prevent it. You talk about how trauma drives violence among groups the public can get behind, like young people, women and veterans. You adopt language used by the doctors and surgeons working on the front lines of this scourge of violence who have been saying for years that it is a public health issue. “You talk about stable housing and equal access to education and health care,” he continued. “You center it around the survivor community begging for alternative solutions. And you tie it back to public safety so you’re changing the terms of the debate.”Finally, incarceration should be the last resort, not the default. In Brooklyn, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez has said this idea is central to his tenure. His counterpart in Boston, Rachael Rollins, last month instructed prosecutors to ask for jail only “when any other recommendation would compromise” safety. When no option other than jail or prison will do, it’s important to remember that the vast majority of people who go in also get out. Making sure they have the tools to lead productive lives when they emerge — like job training and access to decent housing — is a public good.Presidents don’t actually control the key levers of the American punishment machine. About 80 percent of the people who are locked up today are in state and local jails and prisons. But presidents, and presidential campaigns, can raise the profile of an issue and set a tone. The way they talk about repairing our broken criminal justice system speaks loudly to broader issues about racial and wealth inequality. Presidents can also shape the behavior of states and cities with funding and other incentives, like redirecting money for treatment and prevention programs.Though some prosecutors and state legislatures are now embarking on serious reforms, there’s still so much further to go. Bipartisan support is increasing but still has to build. The candidate for president who makes that happen can reap political benefits — and more important, make America so much better.Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of the forthcoming “Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5ca76cdc49f0eacbf1f812c9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/books/instagram-seven-day-book-challenge.html,"Mindless and irresistible as chain letters or online surveys, most internet challenges are like Michael Corleone’s mob in “The Godfather: Part III.” You imagine you’ve given them the slip and they suck you back in. As a rule, I avoid these seductive time traps. Yet there I was recently, scrolling through Instagram for the 10th time that day, when I stumbled on the Seven Day Book Cover Challenge and was instantly hooked.Actually, that’s a misstatement. This innocuous game, which asks users to post a photo of a book cover on a social media platform every day for a week, requires an invitation; it is a challenge, after all. Since no one had actually tagged me, I figured I’d ask.The person I approached was the fashion illustrator and stylist Bill Mullen, whose droll feed — equal parts memoir, style commentary and grim account of a renovation from hell conducted by an upstairs neighbor he refers to as Minnie Castavet — has become digital catnip for those of us hooked on a growing trend for using Instagram to write long. Some Literary Show-and-TellMullen himself had been challenged by @thebookmarc, the bookselling branch of the designer Marc Jacobs’s empire, and his daily book posts skewed irresistibly toward oddball obscurities. Day 1 found him posting a crumbling, yellowed paperback copy of “The Velvet Underground,” a 1963 investigation into “aberrant behavior” among consenting adults, an image he accessorized with an assortment of sex toys that looked like they would hurt. Day 2 featured an unknown (to me) fan-bio-cum-takedown of Blondie by the great and lamented rock critic Lester Bangs, with a cover featuring a youthful Debbie Harry. There followed on Day 3 a vintage Charles Addams book of cartoons and, next, a copy of the 1965 “Hollywood Babylon,” Kenneth Anger’s lascivious (and factually dubious) account of the inhabitants of Tinseltown and their sordid antics.ImageCreditBill MullenImageCreditBill MullenAnd so it went, through titles devoted to the occult (a core interest of Mullen’s; he frequently cites Laurie Cabot, Official Witch of Salem, Mass., when recommending a color of the day) and, separately, Robert Mapplethorpe. It ended — with neither comment nor review, as the challenge mandates — on Day 7 with an original slipcased copy of Jacqueline Susann’s deathless 1966 “Valley of the Dolls.”As with so much else on Instagram, Mullen’s choices were offbeat and campy and also autobiographical, as literary show-and-tell tends to be. His apparent fascination with stuff once culturally marginal and now squarely in the mainstream seemed deliciously synchronous with my own. Because the terms of the challenge (which has been around for some time in various iterations, alternately devoted to books as sources of knowledge or else as pretty objects) stipulated that each post stand alone, there was minimal pressure to flaunt one’s erudition.It Made Sense at the TimeThis, too, had its appeal. Once, in a long ago interview, the filmmaker Joel Schumacher remarked that — while he would not want them all simultaneously to walk into one room — he did not regret anyone he’s ever slept with. This, essentially, is how I feel about my books. Each, in its own way, made sense at the time. Most are still around, though I don’t think about them all that much. The titles I chose were not so much intended to frame my intellectual landscape as to provide a frisson or engender a laugh. I posted what I liked and what came readily to hand. With each volume laid out on a rug in my apartment I did my best with an iPhone to prevent my shadow from falling across, say, a rare copy of “My Face for the World to See,” the autobiography of the Warhol superstar Candy Darling and a book whose cover — the pink vinyl of a schoolgirl’s diary, replete with gilded lock — obviates any need to bother with the text. Next I posted “Ceylon,” a 1950 book of gauzy homoerotic black-and-white photographs by Lionel Wendt, a pianist and polymath Pablo Neruda deemed the pivotal figure in the evolution of national identity in postcolonial Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. I was delighted to discover that book, having forgotten I owned it, and bemused afterward to learn that it now sells online for $1,800. After that came Dennis Cooper’s too little appreciated 1984 novella “Safe,” a book whose black-and-white cover photograph of an orgasmic man seemed prophetic in its resemblance to that on Hanya Yanagihara’s 2015 best-selling novel, “A Little Life.” ImageCreditGuy TrebayImageCreditBookmarcThese were followed by a Pocket Series chapbook of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1986 “Roman Poems,” and an austere catalog from a 2001 exhibition mounted by the Institute for Contemporary Arts at the University of Pennsylvania and devoted to the visionary fashion designer (and gay liberation hero) Rudi Gernreich — he of the topless monokini and the thong.‘A Very Welcome Rabbit Hole’“I never even knew that book existed,” Jennifer Baker, executive vice president of Bookmarc, said of the Gernreich volume, with its dark title, “Fashion Will Go Out of Fashion.”In a sense it was Baker’s “fall down a very welcome rabbit hole” that set in motion my involvement in the challenge, since it was she who challenged Bill Mullen after having been challenged by the hairstylist Jimmy Paul, who had in turn been challenged by the makeup artist Dick Page.“I got out all the books I had in closets,” Baker said by telephone from her Los Angeles office. “I got the boxes out and found myself surrounded by books and thinking about all the feelings I have around books, that visceral connection to them, and not listening to Rachel Maddow for a change.”Like her, I took a deep and almost physical pleasure in the discoveries the book-a-day challenge produced. I knew in advance from his recondite Instagram account that a friend I challenged, the filmmaker Amos Poe, would produce surprises. He did not disappoint. Starting the week somberly with the Polish writer Tadeusz Borowski’s “This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,” a volume that, as it happened, had provided inspiration for the 1984 Style Council song “Ghosts of Dachau,” Poe then leavened his offerings on Day 2 with a pulp fiction comic of the 1940s.ImageCreditAmos PoeImageCreditAmos PoeLillian Ross’s breezy “Portrait of Hemingway” and a paperback Signet copy of Thomas Wolfe’s “Only the Dead Know Brooklyn” came next. Unlike myself, Poe was lavish in sharing the challenge, and although his invitation to play was taken up with relish by the historian and critic Luc Sante and the biographer Robert Becker, some he tapped demurred. Apparently not everyone thrills to the harmless voyeurism of peering into other people’s back pages, as Baker of Bookmarc pointed out. “The hardest part, quite frankly, was challenging seven different people and finding that only a few lived up to it,” she said. “Fashion people followed the rules more than the book people,” she added, which makes sense given that fashion is a largely conformist undertaking while literature depends for its existence on unruly types. The Thrill of PossessionStill, the book cover challenge was both “lighthearted and inspiring,” Baker said, in part because it evoked the thrill of possession she experienced upon unwrapping a special-ordered copy of Jean Stein’s 1982 “Edie: An American Girl” one long-ago Nantucket summer and also because — as with so much else on social media — the stakes of playing along were negligible.“We’re all adults here,” said Baker, who made wonderful, quirky choices in her postings of Joseph Szabo’s 2003 photo essay “Teenage” (published by the magical and now dormant Greybull Press); David Bailey’s 1964 “Rock and Roll Heroes”; Nan Goldin’s 1993 “The Other Side”; and also a first-edition copy of Joan Didion’s “Play It as It Lays,” with its cover illustration of a tequila sunrise Los Angeles skyline and a rattler coiled in silhouette.“I didn’t originally read that particular cover. The cover I read was a stinky, smelly, yellowing 1970s paperback with a tacky illustration of Maria smoking a cigarette,” Baker said, referring to the novel’s protagonist, Maria Wyeth, that emblem of mid-20th-century acedia. “I discovered the original edition way later, and just giving it a revisit for the challenge completely brought back that excitement that wells up in your chest when you hold a favorite book.” Follow Guy Trebay on Instagram: @guytrebay.

5c373d8d3a125f5075c03b82,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/secrets-corporate-reports-apple.html,"Don’t blame Wall Street analysts, rank-and-file investors and journalists for failing to read corporate earnings reports from beginning to end.For one thing, the quarterly and annual reports churned out by publicly traded companies are forbiddingly long. Microsoft’s most recent annual report, known as a 10-K, was 130 pages; Apple’s was 96 pages; Amazon’s was 89 pages.For another, their prose is often dreary and repetitious. Filled with legal language aimed at satisfying securities regulators without alarming investors and driving down share prices, many earnings reports seem designed to be mind-numbingly boring.It’s the financial figures within these pages that are critically important. Is a company generating profits and cash, is it growing, is it borrowing too much or investing too little? Answers to these questions are often revealed in the numbers, but I’ve always thought it best to avoid spending much time on the words.There is evidence that most other people have made the same judgment, yet it turns out that we’ve been making a mistake. The turgid language in these dull corporate reports is actually sprinkled with important clues about major problems — and there is a way to get an inkling about them without actually having to read every word.Those are the main insights of “Lazy Prices,” a fascinating research paper featured in the November issue of The NBER Digest, a publication of the National Bureau of Economic Research. It found that corporate reports are, indeed, repetitious, but when the language in the current text varies a great deal from previous versions, it frequently signals trouble that will become evident several months later.Three economists — Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy of the Harvard Business School, and Quoc Nguyen of DePaul University — downloaded every quarterly and annual corporate report of every publicly traded American company from 1995 to 2014.They then sifted through thousands of reports, using a text analysis program. “We filtered out the reports that made a lot of wording changes over the previous year’s version,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview. “It turned out that when there are a lot of changes, there’s a good chance that something important is going on, and most of the time, it’s negative.”Among the reports that included many such changes, the researchers found a high probability that the companies’ share prices would decline several months after the reports appeared.Textual changes in the “risk factors” section were most likely to predict subsequent moves in share prices. (Corporate earnings reports are rigidly formatted to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements and are divided into predictable sections.) When the researchers refined the analysis further, differentiating between textual changes that were positive and negative, the results were even more striking.The overwhelming majority — 86 percent — of reports with substantial wording changes were primarily negative in tone. But the minority that contained primarily positive language generally correlated with increases in share prices later.That brings up another important point: The stock market rarely responded to the subtle hints in the reports immediately. In fact, it typically took several months for whatever good or bad news was embedded in the reports to be widely understood — and to move the stock market.This delay means that there is a profit opportunity for those able to exploit it, the researchers said.When they constructed a hypothetical portfolio that shorted — or bet against — the companies with primarily negative word changes in the reports, while buying shares of the companies with positive changes, the portfolio outperformed the stock market by 22 percentage points per year.What is perhaps most remarkable is that they selected these investments without actually reading any of the reports or analyzing the stocks or the companies.“Changes to the 10-Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm-level bankruptcies,” the researchers said. That was the case even when the corporate reports contained no outright announcements about such matters.As a result, they said: “We find no announcement effect associated with these changes — with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news, events, or earnings — suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.”Investors are apparently still being inattentive. An excellent “Heard on The Street” column in The Wall Street Journal in June 2017 by Justin Lahart reported on an earlier version of the “Lazy Prices” findings. In that column, Mr. Lahart said explicitly that investors might profit by following the researchers’ methods. And in August, the open-source Quantopian investing site created an algorithm replicating the researchers’ methods, and found that the results remained robust: A new model portfolio outperformed the market.In other words, word changes in corporate reports still appear to be signaling subsequent changes in stock prices and few, if any people, have noticed. That suggests that scarcely anyone has been reading corporate reports thoroughly — and that scarcely anyone has read the “Lazy Prices” paper, either.To be fair, the clues unearthed by the researchers’ approach are fuzzy and imprecise at best.In November, for example, I asked Professor Cohen how I might make practical use of his insights.He suggested two things: “First, always download the previous version of a corporate report as well as the current version, so you can compare the language. Focus on the differences from year to year. Second, focus on one section, the ‘risk factors section.’”I did just that, looking mainly at the latest Apple corporate report, posted on its website on Nov. 5. There was plenty of new language describing the risks that Apple faced — risks that Apple executives discussed in November and disclosed more directly in a letter to shareholders on Jan. 2.These risks included the possibility of an economic slowdown in a place like China, the possibility of slowing iPhone sales, the threat of a trade war and the potential impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. All of these risks have actually materialized and Apple shares have sunk, pulling down the overall stock market.But based on the language changes in the corporate report alone, was there a specific reason for investors to bid down Apple stock, or for a journalist to conclude that Apple was in serious trouble?I didn’t think so at the time, and I still don’t. The linguistic clues were another piece of evidence that needed to be evaluated and, perhaps, bolstered, by other research.Clues like that have real value, though. The “Lazy Prices” research will, at the very least, lead me to read these reports a little differently, in the hope of using them to unearth deeper truths. What’s more, until the “Lazy Prices” research is widely understood, it may be possible for some investors to profit from it."

In an exclusive wide-ranging interview, President Trump said he will proceed on a border wall without lawmakers and dismissed any suggestions of wrongdoing in investigations that have consumed his presidency.Mr. Trump called the current negotiations over the wall “a waste of time” and indicated he will likely take action on his own when they end in two weeks: “I’ve set the table. I’ve set the stage for doing what I’m going to do.”On the topic of China, he expressed optimism at reaching a trade deal. And he denied being at odds with his intelligence chiefs, just a day after calling them “naive” on Twitter.The interview was arranged after Mr. Trump reached out to the publisher of The Times, and invited him for an off-the-record dinner. The publisher declined, saying he would prefer an on-the-record interview that included two of his reporters. Mr. Trump agreed._____ImageCreditKiichiro Sato/Associated Press2. The polar vortex continued to cripple much of the country as temperatures remained near record lows across the Midwest for a second day. Parts of the Northeast also endured subzero wind chills. Above, Chicago at sunrise.At least 21 deaths have been connected with the record-breaking cold, including a University of Iowa freshman who was found unconscious near his dorm, and who died at the hospital.The sustained cold taxed energy systems and forced the cancellation of thousands of flights and closings of schools and universities. In Milwaukee, wind chill fell to minus 50. Here’s what photographers across the frigid regions are seeing.But the cold is expected to begin to lift on Friday. By the end of the weekend, temperatures in some areas could swing up to the 40s or 50s, bringing rain instead of snow._____ImageCreditErin Schaff for The New York Times3. The Senate, in a stinging bipartisan rebuke to President Trump, advanced a measure opposing his moves to withdraw troops in Syria and Afghanistan.The measure, written by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned that “the precipitous withdrawal of United States forces from either country could put at risk hard-won gains and United States national security.”The measure was backed by virtually every Senate Republican and will be added to a broader bipartisan Middle East policy bill expected to pass the Senate next week.But the bipartisan spirit had its limits. Mr. McConnell (above, on Capitol Hill today) called a proposal to make Election Day a holiday a “power grab” by Democrats._____ImageCreditSuzie Howell for The New York Times4. Companies across Britain, faced with increasing uncertainty around the country’s departure from the E.U., have been stockpiling products, making backup plans and exploring new shipping routes. International banks are shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to the Continent.“It’s meant extra resources, extra overtime, to get it done,” said one executive of an auto parts factory in the Midlands of England, pictured above. “It’s incredibly annoying. It’s frustrating.”The economy is 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain in the E.U. in 2016, according to one research institution.

Her latest album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” released last month, shows a slew of new eclectic influences from the previously folk-pop-oriented singer.There are more synths and drum machines on this set than on most of its dreamy predecessors. But the overall feeling is still raw and vulnerable, retaining the traits that make her music so irresistible. Arrangements from the producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Blondie) bolster the singer’s always deft songwriting while insuring that it retains its experimental edge.Van Etten will stop at Beacon Theater in Manhattan in the midst of an 18-date national tour to promote the new release; Fred Armisen (in musical, not comedy, capacities) and Nilüfer Yanya will open. NATALIE WEINERFilm: Hoop Dreams in ‘High Flying Bird’Feb. 7; filmlinc.org. Feb. 8; netflix.com.On the heels of its success with Alfonso Cuarón’s  Oscar-nominated “Roma,” Netflix is throwing its weight this year behind more big-name directors like Martin Scorsese, David Michôd and J.C. Chandor. First up is Steven Soderbergh, whose latest, “High Flying Bird,” stars André Holland as Ray Burke, an agent in the midst of an N.B.A. lockout who proposes a bold business move to his rookie client and in the process tries to disrupt the infrastructure — namely, the rich white dudes — behind the sexiest sport.Zazie Beetz, Melvin Gregg, Zachary Quinto, Kyle MacLachlan and Bill Duke co-star in this wily, slick drama, shot by Soderbergh on an iPhone 7 Plus from a script by Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight,” which starred Holland; and Broadway’s “Choir Boy”). Netflix is releasing the movie online as well as in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 8. The Film Society of Lincoln Center in Manhattan will screen it the evening before, with Soderbergh, McCraney and Holland, among others, on hand.

But its latest project, which arrives at Carnegie’s Zankel Hall on Friday, responds cogently to an era of increasingly policed and politicized borders. “Music for Change: The Banned Countries” is a rejoinder to President Trump’s first travel ban, featuring music from the predominantly Muslim nations the executive order targeted, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The sprawling program features arrangements of traditional music, Kronos staples like Franghiz Ali-Zadeh’s visceral “Mugam Sayagi,” a set with the Iranian vocalist Mahsa Vahdat, a new work by the Egyptian underground keyboardist Islam Chipsy, and the premiere of a Carnegie commission by Fatimah Al-Zaelaeyah. WILLIAM ROBINDance: Hip-Hop in Shining Armor at the MetFeb. 8; metmuseum.org.Raiding the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Arms and Armor Department would be a dream for some artists. For members of It’s Showtime NYC! — a program that provides street dancers with legal alternatives to performing on the subway — it recently became a reality. While generally displayed as static objects, medieval suits of armor are actually meant to be moved in. And who better to put these uniforms in motion than a group of super-swift and hyper-flexible dancers?Combining the idea of a dance battle with the trappings of ancient combat, MetLiveArts presents “Battle! Hip Hop in Armor,” a Friday-night event that kicked off last fall and continues on Feb. 8. The battlefield is Gallery 371, where dancers from It’s Showtime gather to face off in chain mail, breastplates and other knightly attire.

But they date back to the late 19th and early 20th century, when ikats were made with a technique called “cloud binding,” in which bundles of tied-up threads are resist-dyed multiple times to create complex patterns.

All Arts, a free streaming platform and television channel, wants to break down those barriers.A creation of the New York-based WNET, the flagship station of PBS, All Arts will present programs in dance, film, literature, music, theater, visual art and design — some new, others culled from the WNET archives.This week’s lineup includes the Theater of War’s production of “Antigone in Ferguson,” an adaptation of Sophocles’ tragedy conceived in the wake of Michael Brown’s 2014 death in Ferguson, Mo., starring Samira Wiley and Chris Noth (Feb. 3). Next is a 1964 conversation with Chinua Achebe, the Nigerian author of “Things Fall Apart” (Feb. 5). Then comes on Feb. 6 a performance by the jazz pianist Vijay Iyer; and a behind-the-scenes peek at the Broadway productions of “Once on This Island” and “Aladdin.”All Arts can be streamed on platforms like Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV; it is also broadcast in New York on Optimum, Verizon Fios, Comcast, Spectrum and Digital Antenna (check local listings).

Unlike his forward-thinking contemporary Henrik Ibsen, the thrice-married Strindberg took an exceedingly dim view of the opposite sex — and you can see it in his work. With feminism resurgent, this would not appear to be his moment.But the pair of Strindberg plays currently in previews at Classic Stage Company, in the East Village, don’t come directly from his pen. “Mies Julie” is Yael Farber’s muscular and moving 2012 adaptation of his drama “Miss Julie,” set in post-apartheid South Africa as a white landowner’s daughter and a black servant navigate their mutual attraction. “The Dance of Death” is Conor McPherson’s version, also from 2012 — refreshed and invigorated, yet still a portrait of a marriage as a decades-long joust through a hellscape.Performed in repertory, the productions open on Feb. 10, with “Mies Julie” staged by Shariffa Ali and “The Dance of Death” by the Tony Award-winning actress turned director Victoria Clark.

5c3270e53a125f5075c03130,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/technology/market-downturn-venture-capital-investors.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Vini Letteri, a managing director at KKR who invests in tech companies, had a slow 2018.Mr. Letteri, a venture capitalist who manages a $714 million fund, tried to put some of that money into 12 tech start-ups last year — but failed when they demanded too rich a price. In some cases, he said, his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 percent. The only investment he led in 2018 was a $360 million deal in OutSystems, a software company in Atlanta.So here’s what Mr. Letteri is not-so-secretly hoping for in 2019: a downturn in the private start-up market.“When the market turns, we’re prepared to be more aggressive,” he said. He added that he had sketched out a “downturn list” of 150 targets — including financial tech, cybersecurity, and consumer internet companies — in case they become cheaper.Mr. Letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene. For the past few years, Silicon Valley tech start-ups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later.Now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline. Stocks tumbled late last year, led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple, amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China. And so far this year, the stock market has swung wildly, whipsawed by confusing signals including Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last month.While it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the start-up market, many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year.“We definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn,” said Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP who projects that start-up valuations will fall by 10 percent to 40 percent this year. He said his Silicon Valley venture firm has set aside “meaningful reserves” to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in, though he declined to specify an amount.Silicon Valley investors have long complained that start-up valuations have gotten too expensive, given that the start-up ecosystem has been on a bull run since at least 2015. That has minted an unprecedented number of “unicorn” start-ups, which are valued at more than $1 billion, including now-giant companies such as Uber and Airbnb.ImageNot all venture capitalists want a downturn, especially if it interferes with plans of companies like Uber to go public.CreditDave Sanders for The New York TimesBut the rising valuations have only continued to climb in the last year. In 2018, the median company valuation for one category of mature start-ups more than doubled to $420 million, up from $183 million in 2017, according to Carta, a provider of valuation software and services. And in a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study of 135 unicorn start-ups, researchers concluded the companies were overvalued by an average of 50 percent.“There’s too much heat around good, not necessarily great, companies” that are older, said Mamoon Hamid, a partner at the venture firm Kleiner Perkins. Even one “good, not great” company he recently met with had 13 investment offers, he said. The upshot: Kleiner did not invest.Greg Sands, a managing partner at Costanoa Ventures, said his venture firm walked away from three investments in 2018 where the price was 30 percent higher than he was willing to pay, an increase from past years. He also screened out numerous companies that were asking for more money than seemed reasonable — yet some of those companies then went on to raise triple that amount from other investors.“What’s happening right now isn’t sustainable and it won’t go on forever. It can’t,” he said. Costanoa raised a $75 million “opportunity fund,”, which Mr. Sands said would give it the ability to do more deals when the market cools down.Many other venture capital firms are also in a position to become more aggressive in case of a market downturn. Venture funds raised $30.2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, on track to surpass 2017’s total of $35.3 billion, according to PitchBook, a data provider.Start-up founders also appear to be preparing for a potential shift in fortunes. In a survey conducted late last year by First Round Capital, a venture capital firm, just under half of 529 entrepreneurs said they expected fund-raising to become more difficult in 2019. A third said they believed the tech bubble was close to popping, a 10-point increase over 2017.Some start-ups are raising more money to weather the uncertainty, according to Kirsten Green, a managing partner at Forerunner Ventures. Others are creating backup plans to cut costs so their survival won’t depend on new funding.Not all venture capitalists want a downturn, especially if it will throw a wrench into the plans of some of the biggest unicorns — such as Uber, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack — to go public. Many investors are eager to cash out of those companies when they stage an initial public offering.“You always want a better market,” said Micah Rosenbloom, a managing partner at Founder Collective, which was an early investor in Uber. “In a crisis, everything gets hard. You’d rather have your companies in good times for everything from hiring to sales.”Still, Mr. Rosenbloom said he also saw opportunity in a downturn. His firm’s two most successful investments — Uber and the Trade Desk, a digital advertising company — were created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.In previous downturns, the less serious entrepreneurs disappeared, leaving the most committed ones, said David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock. “During those periods, some incredible companies were founded by highly determined entrepreneurs,” he said. “The cream rose to the top.”"

5c8566ff49f0eacbf105c537,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/gordiloca-laredo-priscilla-villarreal.html,"LAREDO, Tex. — Priscilla Villarreal roams the streets of Laredo in an old Dodge pickup, scrambling to drug busts and murder scenes to bring her tales from the dark side of the southwest border to her many viewers.Rappers celebrate her scoops, proclaiming that “she gets more love than our own city’s mayor.”“I guess this makes me famous, huh?” said Ms. Villarreal, 34, a 10th-grade dropout with a shaved head, an abundance of tattoos and an impassioned 119,000-strong following on Facebook. She is arguably the most influential journalist in Laredo, a border city of 260,000.Reporting in profanity-laced Spanglish and calling herself La Gordiloca, which roughly translates as the Crazy Fat Lady, Ms. Villarreal’s swift rise to prominence reflects how many people on the border now prefer to get their news — and just maybe, provides a glimpse at the future of journalism.All the notoriety amounts to a big shift for Ms. Villarreal. Just a few years ago she was working part time for a wrecking crew removing scrap from tractor-trailer crash sites. She was struggling with depression and post-traumatic stress after losing a baby born prematurely.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]But Ms. Villarreal embarked on a second career in muckraking in 2015. She has held local officials accountable — emerging victorious from a caustic legal battle with the Laredo Police Department over press freedom — and unearthed stories that were not being told.“News on the Move,” she calls it.Fans stop her on the street now to ask for autographs or selfies; Laredo eateries hire her to advertise their cuisine.“She’s already something of a folk hero down there,” said Daxton Stewart, a journalism professor specializing in media law at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. “What’s fascinating is that she’s doing it the old-fashioned way, but with new technologies, by breaking news the authorities just don’t want out there.”Her recent reports include a horrific case of child abuse (“Teenagers having babies!!” she opined), the arrest of a school superintendent in Waco for possession of marijuana (“Let’s all do a petition for him in Laredo so he won’t lose his job!!”), drug raids and messy tractor-trailer accidents.ImageMs. Villarreal goes live on Facebook from the scene of an overturned tractor-trailer.CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesMs. Villarreal reports entirely on Facebook, often by live-streaming video on her page on her iPhone. Some follow her because of her fire-breathing reporting style, blending facts with chisme (gossip), but many in Laredo welcome her exposés on public corruption in a city whose abundant reports of graft are the target of an F.B.I. investigation.In February, for instance, she scooped the competition with a report about a former Laredo police investigator who was accused of taking gambling proceeds from raids on slot-machine casinos, then was allowed to resign when confronted with the findings.It took days for competitors to finally catch up and get the story about Anthony Carrillo Jr., 47, a 26-year veteran of the police force, when he was charged with tampering with evidence and abuse of his official capacity.Laredo police officers arrested Ms. Villarreal in December 2017 and charged her with two counts of misuse of official information, a third-degree felony. They said the charges were in connection with her reporting on the 2017 suicide of a Customs and Border Protection supervisor, whose name Ms. Villarreal published.For months before her arrest, the police department had also been hunting down the source of other leaks to Ms. Villarreal. They identified a police officer suspected of supplying the information — a woman who had worked on the force for 19 years — after searching the officer’s phone and finding hundreds of calls exchanged with Ms. Villarreal.The department placed the officer on suspension for 20 days and said in a statement that the case against Ms. Villarreal involved an “obligation to the protection of a person’s right to privacy as it relates to sensitive information.”The district judge who examined the case promptly dismissed the charges against Ms. Villarreal, but the legal battle left her with mixed feelings about her work.“The case made me even more well-known in Laredo, and more sources talk to me now,” she said. “But I remain scared, and who I’m most scared of here aren’t the criminals or smugglers. It’s the Laredo Police Department.”Without editors to review her work, Ms. Villarreal reports almost entirely on her own. The only person who occasionally helps her monitor developments in Laredo is her mother, Maricela Rodríguez, 55, a former migrant worker who used to harvest sugar beets in Minnesota to support her family.“I'm still learning how to say things like ‘allegedly’ or ‘it’s being said’ when I’m describing breaking news,” Ms. Villarreal said. “It’s a challenge, because I speak the language of the streets, and that’s why people follow me.”ImageMs. Villarreal, seated, greets her fans Hilda Peña, 72, left, and Maricela Rodriguez, 64, at a restaurant in Laredo.CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesAs newspapers in this part of Texas cut staff and resources for reporting, Ms. Villarreal is pressing ahead. She makes a small amount of money by promoting restaurants she frequents, though it is not enough to replace her 1998 Dodge Ram truck, which she bought used for $700 and affectionately calls her Blue Demon.“For some reason, I find reporting therapeutic,” said Ms. Villarreal, describing her severe depression after losing her baby a decade ago. She said she gained about 100 pounds after the loss, and tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrist.One part of the job that she dislikes, Ms. Villarreal said, is what she calls “my haters.” Some go on her Facebook page and mock her appearance or her demeanor. Others express disgust at all her swearing. Indeed, many of her reports would have trouble finding their way into the pages of a family newspaper.“Every other word out of her mouth is obscene,” said Abundio Rene Cantú, a lawyer for a Laredo day care center that sued Ms. Villarreal for defamation after she reported that children at the site were being mistreated. Ms. Villarreal is appealing an initial ruling against her.“This is a woman who has no respect for the rule of law, or due process,” Mr. Cantú said. “I feel she is a danger to this community because she interferes with law enforcement.”When Ms. Villarreal recently declared opposition to President Trump and his plans for a border wall, some conservatives in Laredo questioned whether she was an undocumented immigrant. (Ms. Villarreal’s grandparents are from Mexico and she was born in the United States.)Most days, she pays her detractors little heed. On a recent day, she prowled the city in the Blue Demon, cranking up the volume as she sang along with Tejano bands like Siggno.Stopping for lunch a short stroll from the border, at the La Posada Hotel, Ms. Villareal was quickly recognized. Some diners stopped to give her a hug and express best wishes about a new revelation: Ms. Villarreal is pregnant. Others lined up to take selfies with her.“I’m one of your top fans,” Hilda Peña, 72, told Ms. Villarreal after wandering over to take a photograph with her. Ms. Peña, a retired financial services administrator, said that Ms. Villarreal won her over last year with her reporting on Juan David Ortiz, the Border Patrol agent accused of killing several women in Laredo. (According to investigators, he has confessed to four killings; he has pleaded not guilty.)“With that serial killer on the loose, I wondered if I should get my gun,” Ms. Peña said. “But La Gordiloca made it clear when the situation was under control.”"

By insisting on full restitution, the idea of ‘long-term loans’ to African countries becomes as absurd as it sounds.”Here’s what else is happeningBrexit: A new poll of Conservative Party members shows that 57 percent prefer leaving the European Union without a deal, despite warnings of price increases and food shortages.France: The French police arrested a prominent leader of the Yellow Vest movement for a second time, a clear signal that the government is following through on a pledge to get tough after violent protests.North Korea: The country’s ambassador to Italy disappeared from its embassy in Rome in November in what appeared to be a defection attempt, according to a South Korean lawmaker.Rome: Pope Francis told U.S. bishops to set aside their differences and confront a “crisis of credibility” stemming from the sexual abuse scandal.Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor formally requested the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of the dissident, but didn’t provide their names, the roles they played in the crime or any other details.ImageThe Queen’s Theater in London will close this summer for a renovation, in part to install 18 more women's toilets.

5ca2833749f0eacbf1f7fea4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/smarter-living/how-to-make-your-phone-limit-your-screen-time-for-you.html,"You probably spend too much time on your phone. Apple and Google seem to agree, which is why both companies have added tools to their phones to help you track and control your phone addiction. Do self-imposed limits really work, though? If you use them right, then they can help break your bad habits.Apple’s feature, called Screen Time, was introduced in iOS 12. Screen Time allows you to monitor how much time you spend using your device and what you’re doing with it. Google has a similar feature for Android devices called Digital Wellbeing that not only charts what you do and for how long, but also packs extra features like turning the screen gray at night to remind you to put your phone down, or it even outright disables apps after a set time.These can be used as part of a parental control system, but they’re also designed to help limit your own screen time. You can find out where you’re sinking your time, decide how much you want to limit your phone usage and enforce rules on yourself. However, since you control those limits, are they really limits, or just mild suggestions from your past self? These tools won’t change your habits for you, but you can use them to help yourself.Examine how you spend your phone time, not just how muchConventional wisdom says that you probably need to put your phone down more than you do. However, one study from researchers at the University of Melbourne suggests that it’s not just how much time you spend on your phone that matters as it is what you’re doing with it. If the time you spend on your phone is meaningful, then it’s not time wasted. In other words, chatting with a loved one or reading a book on your phone would naturally make you happier than arguing on Facebook or reading news that makes you angry.From this perspective, Apple and Google’s tools become a lot more useful. The first component of iOS’s Screen Time is a time tracker. In your device’s settings you can find a chart that shows you when you’re using your device most, how many times you pick up your device and which apps you’re using most. It also shows you how many notifications you get from each app, so you can find out which apps are interrupting you during the day the most.Google’s suite works similarly. Open the Digital Wellbeing section of your phone’s settings — Google’s own Pixel phones have it, but other devices may get it when they receive the Android Pie update — and you’ll be greeted with a circular chart that shows which apps take up the most of your time. You can also explore charts that show what time of day you spend in apps, how many notifications you get and when you’re getting them, and even how much time you spend on each app every day.This glut of information from both platforms has one main purpose: showing you exactly how you spend your time on your phone. Before you start setting up blocks to limit your screen time, take a look at your usage habits and ask yourself what you’re getting out of the apps you spend the most time with. If you’re spending an hour a day on an app that you don’t even enjoy, that realization alone might be enough to break your habit.I Used Apple’s New Controls to Limit a Teenager’s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)July 11, 2018Set limits to nudge — not to control — yourselfOnce you’ve discovered the apps you spend the most time in, you might want to set some limits for yourself. After all, if it were easy to break your Instagram addiction, you would’ve done it by now, right? Apple and Google both give you more tools to do that, however, it’s better to interpret them as helpful nudges, rather than hard blocks.Apple even treats their limits this way. When you set a time limit on an app in Screen Time, your iPhone or iPad will let you use the app uninterrupted until you pass that limit. Afterwards, no matter what you’re doing in the app, you’ll be hit with a full screen warning that you’ve used up your time. However, you can choose to give yourself another fifteen minutes, or even ignore the limit altogether.This approach makes sense. Most of the time you probably want to observe the self-imposed limit, but there may be a time when you just need a few minutes. Hitting the snooze button lets you keep your limit in place while still giving you some flexibility.Google, on the other hand, takes a more hardline approach. When you set an app timer, that’s all the time you get. If you give yourself an hour a day to use Twitter, as soon as you hit your 61st minute, the app will lock down. The icon on your home screen will be grayed out, and if you try to open it, your phone will tell you that you can’t. If you want to use it anyway, you’ll have to disable the timer altogether.In both cases, you can get around an app block if you really want to. However, it can still be helpful to keep those timers on, if only as a reminder of how long you’ve spent in an app. When even the bartender tells you that you’ve had enough, it’s a pretty strong sign that you need to stop. In the same way, if your phone is telling you to put the phone down, you can get around the limits you set for yourself, but at least you no longer have the excuse that you lost track of time.Nightly wind down routines are the secret weaponWhether you spend too much time on your phone during the day may be subjective, but study after study suggests that you should at least put your phone down at night. This is where Apple and Google’s software really shines. Both platforms allow you to set quiet hours. During these hours you can still use your phone, but you might get fewer notifications, or a stronger nudge to put it down.Apple’s Downtime feature allows you to set a few apps that can always be used — like your phone or text messaging app — but block all of the others. This “block” is the same sort of soft-block we’ve mentioned, where you can still get around them. However, blocked apps will be darkened on your home screen. When almost every app is grayed out and nags you to put your phone down when you try to use them, it’s probably time to just get ready for bed.Google’s Wind Down feature is even more clever. For starters, it will put your phone in Do Not Disturb mode, which you can separately configure it to block all but the most important calls and messages. Unfortunately, Google doesn’t allow you to blanket disable most of your apps like iOS does, but you can at least stop getting notifications.More importantly, Wind Down includes a feature called Grayscale. In this mode, all the color is drained from your phone’s screen. This is separate from Night Light, which adjusts your phone’s color temperature to a warmer orange light so it’s less harsh. Grayscale, on the other hand, turns your phone into a black-and-white TV show. At the best of times, this is mildly annoying, but it can make some tasks — like watching a video or playing a game — near impossible. Of all the features on both platforms, this is the strongest nudge to put your phone down that’s not actively disruptive. You can still use your phone in Grayscale mode, but it’s not nearly as fun.Both platforms reserve their harshest punishments for night time phone use. Arguably, this is when you would need those prompts the most. Using your phone in bed or late into the night can disrupt your sleep schedule or lead to restless sleep that follows you the next day.

5c7c86fe49f0eacbf105b29e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/business/media/luminary-media-podcast-app.html,"LOS ANGELES — Patti LuPone as a bebop-singing junkie nun in John Cameron Mitchell’s musical follow-up to “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” A new show from Lena Dunham called “The C-Word.” Series from Conan O’Brien, Malcolm Gladwell and Trevor Noah.It sounds like the latest programming blitz from Netflix. But this lineup — more than 40 exclusive shows, all without ads — has nothing to do with video. The offerings come from a podcast start-up called Luminary that has emerged from stealth mode to unveil nearly $100 million in funding and a subscription-based business model that it hopes will push the medium into a new phase of growth.“We want to become synonymous with podcasting in the same way Netflix has become synonymous with streaming,” Matt Sacks, Luminary’s co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview. “I know how ambitious that sounds. We think it can be done, and some of the top creators in the space agree.”Mr. Sacks, 28, was referring to Guy Raz, known for “How I Built This” and other hit podcasts; Leon Neyfakh, the “Slow Burn” creator and host; and Adam Davidson, a force behind “Planet Money,” the award-winning NPR podcast. All three men have signed on with Luminary for their next shows, which will roll out exclusively on the company’s app in the coming months.Mr. Raz is working on “Wisdom From the Top,” focused on business and political leaders. Mr. Neyfakh will contribute “Fiasco,” an investigative show that delves into governmental imbroglios. And Mr. Davidson has created “Passion Economy,” a podcast about people who experience strokes of genius, like an Amish farmer with no electricity who makes his business skyrocket with the use of an iPhone.Most podcasts are free, but the Luminary app — set to arrive by June — will focus on subscriptions. For $8 a month, subscribers will gain access to Luminary’s ad-free lineup. For creators, Luminary is offering large upfront payment guarantees in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute their work, reducing the risk of a concept and, hopefully, encouraging greater creativity and higher production values. Luminary will also pay creators bonuses if their shows reach certain listening thresholds.“For podcasting to grow, creators must be able to take risks on more conceptual ideas, and the Luminary model provides that comfort,” Mr. Davidson said.Most podcast creators make money by selling ads. Podcasts are expected to generate $514 million in ad sales this year, a sum projected to rise to $659 million in 2020, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC.As with radio or broadcast television, which are also reliant on ad sales, reaching the biggest audience possible is the goal. As a result, the same kinds of mass-appeal podcasts tend to get made. That means news shows, sports commentary and lots of chat.Making a living by advertising, as many podcasters have discovered (like YouTube stars before them), is harder than it looks. The scramble is constant. An advertiser could pour in money one month and vanish the next. With podcasting in particular, it is difficult to measure how many people listen to the ads. More podcast apps offer ad-skipping buttons.The Luminary app will not be totally absent of ads. It will also offer a free area, where listeners can play any of the estimated 600,000 ad-supported and nonexclusive podcasts in the market.“Matt has figured out a smart and sustainable way to push the business forward — better discovery for listeners, allowing creators to focus on creating the highest-quality content possible and stop worrying about selling ads,” Liza Landsman, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm that has invested in Luminary, said of Mr. Sacks.Luminary has 70 employees in New York and Chicago, about 40 of whom are engineers. The company is beginning a marketing campaign on Monday that includes outdoor advertising in New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Tex.To some degree, of course, all media start-ups think they are going to be the next Netflix. The test for Luminary will come in the execution. And there are plenty of challenges. Subscription-based businesses are hot at the moment, but analysts say that consumers will begin pushing back and asking, How many entertainment services do I really need to be paying for every month?Luminary is also entering an increasingly crowded field.Apple devices have long dominated the podcast market, despite what analysts describe as a largely ambivalent approach; Apple has improved its podcasting app over the years, but it has never felt like a priority. That could change now that Google has reintroduced a podcast player and music streaming services like Spotify are looking to podcasting for growth.Last month, Spotify paid a reported $230 million for Gimlet Media, a producer of audio dramas like “Homecoming” and “Crimetown.” Spotify also offers free listening with ads and a premium version for subscribers who pay a $10 monthly fee. And Spotify offers some exclusive podcast shows from stars like Amy Schumer and the rapper Joe Budden.Other podcast platforms include Stitcher, Pocket Casts, Overcast and Castbox. Among start-ups, Himalaya Media, a San Francisco start-up backed by the Chinese audio giant Ximalaya FM, announced last month that it had raised $100 million and would introduce a podcast-distribution app with exclusive shows and a feature that would allow listeners to leave gratuities. Its stated goal? “To climb to the peak of the global podcast space.”Mr. Sacks brushed off the competition.“Just like in the premium television space, there is more than enough room for multiple offerings to thrive,” he said.“What sets Luminary apart,” he continued, “is our exclusive content right off the bat. Nobody comes close.”In addition to new shows from people like Ms. Dunham, whose “C-Word” podcast will offer a weekly look at women who have been deemed “crazy” online, Luminary will serve as the new exclusive home for a half-dozen established podcasts. Those include “Under the Skin,” hosted by the British comedian Russell Brand; a popular sex-focused show with an unprintable name created by Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson; and Nick van der Kolk’s eclectic interview program “Love and Radio.”Still, the project that probably best demonstrates where Luminary would like to go is Mr. Mitchell’s new musical.“Hedwig,” the story of an East German transgender rocker, made its debut Off Broadway in 1998 and became a cultural phenomenon. Mr. Mitchell’s new show, “Anthem: Homunculus,” written with Bryan Weller, is not a sequel, although it contains material that was originally intended for one. The musical is set in a small town and finds Mr. Mitchell’s character battling a brain tumor and running out of insurance. He stages an audio-telethon to raise money for his treatment.In addition to Ms. LuPone, the cast includes six Tony Award winners, including Glenn Close, who wails a punk song while ostensibly nailed to a cross. Produced by Topic Studios, the company behind the hit podcast “Missing Richard Simmons,” the musical includes 31 original songs and will unspool over 10 episodes, stretching roughly six hours in total.“I’m very interested in pushing podcasts to a cinematic level of storytelling,” Mr. Mitchell said. “We had other suitors for this project, but none had the imagination of Luminary. Matt understood what I wanted to do immediately.” Also drawing Mr. Mitchell’s attention: Luminary intends to aggressively market individual podcasts to make them feel more like events.Mr. Sacks grew up in Chicago and studied history at the University of Pennsylvania. When he was a junior, he teamed up with friends to create Splash.FM, a now-defunct social network focused on music discovery.After a brief stint at Goldman Sachs post-graduation, Mr. Sacks went to work at New Enterprise Associates. In early 2017, he found himself scrounging for smart podcasting investments on behalf of the firm. But he couldn’t find any he really liked.“Nobody was focusing on content discovery to the degree that I wanted as a consumer: the right person finding the right show at the right time,” he said. “So I decided to build my own.”"

There aren’t any practical steps we can take in our everyday lives. And there’s nothing we can really do to help anyway. Right?Nope.Every week, The New York Times’s Climate and Environment team publishes a newsletter called Climate Fwd:, which gives you stories and insights about climate change, along with tips on what you can do. In that spirit, we’re partnering with them this week to pull advice from a recurring featuring in their newsletter: One thing you can do. Below are eight things that you — yes, you, the person reading this — can do to care for the planet. (And, of course, click here to subscribe to the Climate Fwd: newsletter.)Hang on to your smartphoneThe little computer you carry with you requires a lot of energy to assemble. The production of an iPhone 6, for example, released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, or about as much as burning nine gallons of gas, according to a 2015 study. Instead of buying a new phone, try to keep yours in working condition for as long as possible (here’s some advice on how to extend its life). But if you must get rid of yours, recycle it or consider buying a used one.Leave leaves Leaves provide shelter for worms, moths and some butterflies, which then become prey for neighborhood birds. They also help nourish and fertilize soil, and you won’t burn fossil fuels by using a lawn mower or leaf blower. Use a dishwasher, not the sinkDishwashers have improved over the years: Average models certified by the government’s Energy Star program use 3.5 gallons or less per cycle. Compare that with an efficient kitchen faucet, which pours 1.5 gallons of water per minute, meaning that handwashing for four minutes nearly doubles the water use of a dishwasher. If you don’t have the luxury of owning a dishwasher, try to do the two-bucket method: “When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.”Buy fewer clothes Manufacturers use water and chemicals to dye and finish cotton clothes. Polyesters and nylons aren’t biodegradable. In this age of fast fashion, it’s best to wear your clothes for a long, long time. (Buying secondhand helps, too.)[Like what you’re reading?

Research your items to avoid having to return them, and always recycle the boxes.Divest from fossil fuelDo your retirement funds or other investments include fossil-fuel companies? Divesting has become common in union, city and state pension funds. In a 2018 report published by Arabella Advisors, a philanthropy services firm, 61 pension funds have committed to divestment since 2016, bringing the total to 144. Consider adjusting your retirement fund, and ask if your 401(k) can be fossil-fuel free.Be mindful of your food waste A massive amount of energy goes into producing the food we eat, especially meat and dairy. For example, the production of a single hamburger uses the same amount of water as a 90-minute shower. And about 40 percent of food in the United States is thrown away. To limit food waste when you’re hosting a get-together, use this “Guest-imator” to calculate the amount of groceries you’ll need. Also check out the “Waste-Free Kitchen Handbook” for more help on reducing food waste.Tune your heating systemMost American homes are heated by furnaces or boilers, according to the Energy Department, and poorly maintained systems can burn more oil or natural gas than is necessary. Hire a technician to inspect yours to make sure it’s running efficiently and to cut down on indoor particulate matter. And if you have a boiler system that uses radiators, consider installing an outdoor reset control, which modulates the radiator’s water temperature based on the temperature outside. All of this can even result in direct savings for you: These small actions can knock down a heating bill by up to 10 percent. Best of Smarter Living Watch Out.

The first step is eliminating minor tasks and actions that suck up time, energy and gray matter. My solution? Throwing money — small amounts, mind you — at problems.And no, this isn’t just a cop-out to doing work: A 2017 study found that “spending money to save time may reduce stress about the limited time in the day, thereby improving happiness.”Here’s my strategy.Buy common items in bulkI’m done pretending that certain items I use every day will never run out (as all logic and experience would suggest). After realizing “go to Target” was playing on a loop in my mind, I resolved to spend less time and mental energy running errands for basic essentials. So I ordered embarrassingly large quantities online and got them delivered instead. Now I have enough toilet paper, paper towels, tampons, oatmeal and coffee to carry me through to 2020.Buy doublesWhat do you use — or carry around — every day? I was transporting a wireless mouse to work for months before realizing they cost $10 and that buying two would allow me to stop thinking about it altogether. Purchasing multiple phone chargers also comes with minimal cost but maximum benefit. You can stop borrowing your colleague’s and never worry about hovering at 12 percent again.Buy helpWhether you hire someone to clean your home or install your new 4K TV, the point is this: Paying someone to perform tasks that are always on your mind will get them done more quickly (and regularly) than if you try to do them yourself. Then you can focus on literally anything else. Your brain will thank you."
5c5749d03a125f5075c07d07,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/technology/tech-warning-signs.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Don’t look now: Storm clouds are gathering over tech.Chinese consumers have pulled back their spending, blowing a $9 billion hole in Apple’s recent quarterly revenue. China was again a culprit when Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations, though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centers.Intel, the big chip maker, cited intensifying “trade and macro concerns” for financial results in January that did not meet expectations. And Samsung, another semiconductor powerhouse, said sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones.China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand.Warnings about a sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Micron Technology and Western Digital. It’s an abrupt reversal, coming on the heels of stellar results in 2018 for the business that gave Silicon Valley its name.Last year, manufacturers shipped a staggering 1 trillion chips and other semiconductor devices, 10 percent more than the year before, IC Insights estimates. But 2019 is shaping up to be a much different story, now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampening.The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust.Back then, investors showed no mercy. Intel made what seemed a modest adjustment to its revenue forecast for the third quarter of 2000, saying it would be up 3 to 5 percent instead of 7 to 9 percent. The value of the company immediately fell by nearly 30 percent over the next few days.This year, with a similar downgrade, investors largely shrugged it off. Intel shed about 5 percent of its value over a week.While acknowledging the parallels to 2000, Gene Munster, research director for Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, said, “I think it’s different this time.”Back then, among the best customers for the established chip firms were start-ups, which had more dreams than revenue. As the start-ups faltered, the chip firms were imperiled. The storm lasted for years.“These are all real companies now, with real customers,” Mr. Munster said. “People are willing to look past a few bumpy months.”Even if the problems do not linger, they are a reminder that demand is not eternal. That seems to be what happened with smartphones, which use multiple varieties of chips to run software, process data and connect to cellular networks.Consider Apple, which gave a muted forecast in October for the holiday season and followed up early last month with its first full-fledged revenue warning in 16 years. The iPhone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in China. Total smartphone shipments fell 15 percent in that country in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Canalys.Michael Wolf, who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm Activate, said people seem to be shifting to lower-priced phone models and cheaper service plans. But he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like Netflix, video games, online advertising and business-to-business sales for companies like Microsoft.“From all of our research, I don’t see some general consumer malaise,” Mr. Wolf said.Yet several other businesses appear to be softening as well, including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Sales of high-priced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like Intel and Nvidia, but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautious.“Cloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity,” Robert Swan, who was then Intel’s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said on a conference call after Intel released its fourth-quarter results. (On Thursday, Mr. Swan became Intel’s chief executive.)Longtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips, an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the United States and rivals in Japan and South Korea. Makers of a key category called dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industry.During the dot-com bust of 2001, DRAM revenue plummeted 63 percent while total semiconductor revenue fell 31 percent, according to Gartner data.But conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits, leaving three major DRAM makers — Samsung, Hynix and Micron. They have been slow to boost production, enabling them to keep their prices high. And they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones, data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most sales.“The markets today are structurally different,” Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron’s chief executive, said in a recent interview.Yet market cycles haven’t disappeared entirely. DRAM prices peaked last June and began sliding, prompting Micron and Samsung to issue their recent profit warnings. DRAMeXchange, a Taiwan-based firm that tracks the market, predicts DRAM prices will fall an additional 20 percent in the first quarter.Memory chips “behave like onions or steel or any other commodity,” said Jim Handy, a market researcher at Objective Analysis. “If there is an oversupply, prices fall.”Nvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust. The 25-year-old company, which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games, became one of Silicon Valley’s most valuable companies in 2017 as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giants.But Nvidia’s processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency, driving a surge in demand that inflated prices and created a shortage of chips. Buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders, making it hard for the company to get a handle on conventional demand for its technology.The cryptocurrency bubble faded suddenly last year, causing Nvidia’s revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips. The crypto issue “ended up being way, way bigger” for the company than expected, said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. “It’s been a crazy story.”For all the turmoil, industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain a lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps. For one thing, a series of mergers has reduced price competition. Companies like Micron, which routinely lost money in past cycles, are expected to remain solidly profitable even if sales dip.Beyond that, there is the glorious future.“Eventually the storm will pass and these companies — Nvidia, Apple, Samsung — will have a pole position in the next tech growth curve, including A.I., health care, self-driving cars, 5G,” said Mr. Munster, the Loup analyst. “The curve is so exciting, so juicy, so full of opportunity.”"
5ca8f08849f0eacbf1f815d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/climate-change-nuclear-power.html,"As young people rightly demand real solutions to climate change, the question is not what to do — eliminate fossil fuels by 2050 — but how. Beyond decarbonizing today’s electric grid, we must use clean electricity to replace fossil fuels in transportation, industry and heating. We must provide for the fast-growing energy needs of poorer countries and extend the grid to a billion people who now lack electricity. And still more electricity will be needed to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by midcentury.Where will this gargantuan amount of carbon-free energy come from? The popular answer is renewables alone, but this is a fantasy. Wind and solar power are becoming cheaper, but they are not available around the clock, rain or shine, and batteries that could power entire cities for days or weeks show no sign of materializing any time soon. Today, renewables work only with fossil-fuel backup. Germany, which went all-in for renewables, has seen little reduction in carbon emissions, and, according to our calculations, at Germany’s rate of adding clean energy relative to gross domestic product, it would take the world more than a century to decarbonize, even if the country wasn’t also retiring nuclear plants early. A few lucky countries with abundant hydroelectricity, like Norway and New Zealand, have decarbonized their electric grids, but their success cannot be scaled up elsewhere: The world’s best hydro sites are already dammed.Small wonder that a growing response to these intimidating facts is, “We’re cooked.”But we actually have proven models for rapid decarbonization with economic and energy growth: France and Sweden. They decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world’s most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot.They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power’s intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power.This is a realistic solution to humanity’s greatest problem. Plants built 30 years ago in America, as in France, produce cheap, clean electricity, and nuclear power is the cheapest source in South Korea. The 98 U.S. reactors today provide nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. So why don’t the United States and other countries expand their nuclear capacity? The reasons are economics and fear.New nuclear power plants are hugely expensive to build in the United States today. This is why so few are being built. But they don’t need to be so costly. The key to recovering our lost ability to build affordable nuclear plants is standardization and repetition. The first product off any assembly line is expensive — it cost more than $150 million to develop the first iPhone — but costs plunge as they are built in quantity and production kinks are worked out. Yet as a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission put it, while France has two types of reactors and hundreds of types of cheese, in the United States it’s the other way around. In recent decades, the United States and some European countries have created ever more complicated reactors, with ever more safety features in response to public fears. New, one-of-a-kind designs, shifting regulations, supply-chain and construction snafus and a lost generation of experts (during the decades when new construction stopped) have driven costs to absurd heights.These economic problems are solvable. China and South Korea can build reactors at one-sixth the current cost in the United States. With the political will, China could replace coal without sacrificing economic growth, reducing world carbon emissions by more than 10 percent. In the longer term, dozens of American start-ups are developing “fourth generation” reactors that can be mass-produced, potentially generating electricity at lower cost than fossil fuels. If American activists, politicians and regulators allow it, these reactors could be exported to the world in the 2030s and ’40s, slaking poorer countries’ growing thirst for energy while creating well-paying American jobs. Currently, fourth-generation nuclear power receives rare bipartisan agreement in Congress, making it a particularly appealing American policy to address climate change. Congress recently passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act by big margins. Both parties love innovation, entrepreneurship, exports and jobs.This approach will need a sensible regulatory framework. Currently, as M.I.T.’s Richard Lester, a nuclear engineer, has written, a company proposing a new reactor design faces “the prospect of having to spend a billion dollars or more on an open-​ended, all‑or‑nothing licensing process without any certainty of outcomes.” We need government on the side of this clean-energy transformation, with supportive regulation, streamlined approval, investment in research and incentives that tilt producers and consumers away from carbon.All this, however, depends on overcoming an irrational dread among the public and many activists. The reality is that nuclear power is the safest form of energy humanity has ever used. Mining accidents, hydroelectric dam failures, natural gas explosions and oil train crashes all kill people, sometimes in large numbers, and smoke from coal-burning kills them in enormous numbers, more than half a million per year.By contrast, in 60 years of nuclear power, only three accidents have raised public alarm: Three Mile Island in 1979, which killed no one; Fukushima in 2011, which killed no one (many deaths resulted from the tsunami and some from a panicked evacuation near the plant); and Chernobyl in 1986, the result of extraordinary Soviet bungling, which killed 31 in the accident and perhaps several thousand from cancer, around the same number killed by coal emissions every day. (Even if we accepted recent claims that Soviet and international authorities covered up tens of thousands of Chernobyl deaths, the death toll from 60 years of nuclear power would still equal about one month of coal-related deaths.)Nuclear power plants cannot explode like nuclear bombs, and they have not contributed to weapons proliferation, thanks to robust international controls: 24 countries have nuclear power but not weapons, while Israel and North Korea have nuclear weapons but not power. Nuclear waste is compact — America’s total from 60 years would fit in a Walmart — and is safely stored in concrete casks and pools, becoming less radioactive over time. After we have solved the more pressing challenge of climate change, we can either burn the waste as fuel in new types of reactors or bury it deep underground. It’s a far easier environmental challenge than the world’s enormous coal waste, routinely dumped near poor communities and often laden with toxic arsenic, mercury and lead that can last forever.Despite its demonstrable safety, nuclear power presses several psychological buttons. First, people estimate risk according to how readily anecdotes like well-publicized nuclear accidents pop into mind. Second, the thought of radiation activates the mind-set of disgust, in which any trace of contaminant fouls whatever it contacts, despite the reality that we all live in a soup of natural radiation. Third, people feel better about eliminating a single tiny risk entirely than minimizing risk from all hazards combined. For all these reasons, nuclear power is dreaded while fossil fuels are tolerated, just as flying is scary even though driving is more dangerous.Opinions are also driven by our cultural and political tribes. Since the late 1970s, when No Nukes became a signature cause of the Green movement, sympathy to nuclear power became, among many environmentalists, a sign of disloyalty if not treason.Despite these challenges, psychology and politics can change quickly. As the enormity of the climate crisis sinks in and the hoped-for carbon savings from renewables don’t add up, nuclear can become the new green. Protecting the environment and lifting the developing world out of poverty are progressive causes. And the millennials and Gen Z’s might rethink the sacred values their boomer parents have left unexamined since the Doobie Brothers sang at the 1979 No Nukes concert.If the American public and politicians can face real threats and overcome unfounded fears, we can solve humanity’s most pressing challenge and leave our grandchildren a bright future of climate stability and abundant energy. We can dispatch, once and for all, the self-fulfilling prophesy that we’re cooked.Joshua S. Goldstein, professor emeritus of international relations at American University, and Staffan A.

The Times has also published a major investigation into how Rupert Murdoch and his family have destabilized democracy around the world.President Trump backs off health care fight Health care will almost certainly be a central theme in the 2020 elections, after Mr. Trump said Republicans would not produce a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act before then.Mr. Trump’s reversal followed a warning from Senator Mitch McConnell, who said on Tuesday, “I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans’ view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives.”Catch up: A previous Republican effort to replace President Barack Obama’s health care law failed in 2017, but Mr. Trump revived the issue last week, promising a Republican replacement after his administration told a federal appeals court that the entire law should be invalidated. The Daily: Today’s episode is about Mr. Trump’s new approach toward health care.Yesterday: Mr. Trump acknowledged that closing the border with Mexico, which he threatened to do this week, could damage the U.S. economy, but said security was more important than trade.ImageLori Lightfoot in Chicago on Tuesday. “We were up against powerful interests, a powerful machine and a powerful mayor,” she said. “Nobody gave us much of a chance.”CreditMichelle V. Agins/The New York TimesChicago chooses an outsider as its mayorLori Lightfoot, who has never held elective office, easily won Tuesday’s election, and will become the first African-American woman to lead the city. When she takes office in May, she’ll also be Chicago’s first openly gay mayor.Ms. Lightfoot, a 56-year-old former federal prosecutor, ran as an outsider in a city that has often turned to political insiders. She will succeed Rahm Emanuel, who has led Chicago for the past eight years.Watch: Our video offers more details about Ms. Lightfoot, who has held appointed positions. Those included leading a task force that issued a scathing report on relations between the Chicago police and black residents. ImageJeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, today in London.CreditNeil Hall/EPA, via ShutterstockStrategic pivot for British leader Prime Minister Theresa May broke with her own party on Tuesday and appealed to the opposition Labour Party to work on a plan for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.With Parliament deadlocked on the issue and alarm growing about a possible departure without a deal in place, Mrs. May also said she would ask Brussels for an extension to the April 12 deadline.What’s next: Mrs. May’s immediate plan is to try to reach an agreement with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and get Parliament’s support for it before an E.U. meeting next week. Whether she could do that — and whether the bloc would approve another delay — remained unclear.The details: Hard-line members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party have shrugged off warnings of severe economic consequences from a no-deal exit. Here’s what it might look like.A key to the Arctic’s oil richesFor more than three decades, the findings from an exploratory well in Alaska have been one of the oil industry’s most closely guarded secrets. Was it a dry hole or a potential gusher?Interested parties want to know as the Trump administration prepares to sell drilling leases in the area, which has long been believed to contain North America’s biggest untapped onshore trove of oil.The Times found answers 4,000 miles away, in a Cleveland courthouse, where a lawsuit contained hints that the findings were disappointing. A lawyer who was involved in the case told our reporters: “The discovery well was worthless.”Why it matters: One dry hole doesn’t mean there’s no oil, but discouraging results could embolden opponents of drilling and prompt second thoughts among potential lease bidders.If you have a solid block of time, this is worth itThe Murdoch revolutionImageCreditPhoto illustration by Joan WongThere’s no single explanation for the wave of right-wing populism across the world. But Rupert Murdoch’s empire has done more than any other media company to enable it, promote it and profit from it. Our three-part investigation describes the Murdoch family’s role in destabilizing democracy in North America, Europe and Australia. The product of six months of digging, the report shows how two major stories of our times — one of nativist forces, the other of the Murdoch dynasty — are really one. Here’s what else is happeningArrest at Mar-a-Lago: A woman from China carrying a thumb drive infected with malware got into President Trump’s Florida resort during his visit there over the weekend, federal court records show.New Joe Biden accusations: Two more women told The Times on Tuesday that touches from the former vice president had made them uncomfortable. Mr. Biden has denied acting inappropriately but has said he will “listen respectfully.”Cholera follows cyclone: A vaccination campaign is set to start today in Mozambique after a devastating storm two weeks ago that displaced about two million people. Malaria is a threat, too, but aid agencies are optimistic. Capital punishment in Brunei: Adultery and gay sex are punishable with death by stoning under Islamic laws that went into effect today in Brunei, a sultanate of about 430,000 people on the island of Borneo.Algeria’s president resigns: Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has led the North African country for 20 years, has submitted his resignation under pressure from the army after weeks of mass protests.Fixes: In an Op-Ed, the co-founder of an organization that supports reporting about responses to social problems, discusses sex trafficking at truck stops.ImageCreditSue Ogrocki/Associated PressSnapshot: Above, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, when he became the second player in N.B.A. history to have at least 20 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a game.

Well, after nine years, they still haven’t gotten around to the ‘replace’ part.”What we’re reading: This piece in The Los Angeles Times.

Based in southeastern Virginia, The Pilot’s coverage bleeds into North Carolina.The Pilot earned a Pulitzer Prize in 1929 for an editorial on the evils of lynching; another in 1960 for editorials on officials’ stonewalling of school integration; and a third in 1985 for reporting on local corruption.Last year, The Pilot was a finalist for the Pulitzer in investigative reporting, for documenting injustices in Virginia’s parole system.

5c6ac8d33a125f5075c0a44d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/television/desus-and-mero-showtime.html,"One morning earlier this month, Desus Nice and the Kid Mero were in the Jam Room of Milk Studios in Chelsea, recording a new episode of their “Bodega Boys” podcast and riffing on everything that crossed their minds. They recapped the State of the Union address; compared God’s creation of the platypus to their own efforts at making nachos while high; and wondered whether waterboarding still takes place at C.I.A. black sites during government shutdowns.Imagining alternate, low-cost forms of torture, Desus said, “Strap you to a chair and make you watch ‘Young Sheldon,’” while Mero pretended to scream.Then, affecting a tone of exaggerated seriousness, Desus added, “Actually, uh, ‘Young Sheldon’ comes on CBS and is a wonderful show. Be sure to check it out, it’s part of the, uh, Showtime family.”After several years of online infamy and grass-roots success, Desus (the stage name of Daniel Baker) and the Kid Mero (a.k.a. Joel Martinez) are preparing for their biggest mainstream opportunity to date.They’re about to star in their own Showtime late-night series, “Desus & Mero,” which has its premiere on Thursday and which will attempt to distill their spontaneous pop-cultural outpourings and on-the-fly characters into a weekly, half-hour showcase of comedy sketches, field pieces and celebrity interviews. Showtime said that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be their first in-studio guest, and that coming guests will include John Legend, Ben Stiller, Issa Rae and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.For these two Bronx-born friends and longtime collaborators, the Showtime series is a fulfillment of their trademark boast that “the brand is strong.” Their leap to premium cable comes some six years after gaining the internet’s attention with “Desus vs. Mero,” a podcast that became an online show on the Complex magazine website; numerous appearances on MTV programs like “Guy Code” and “Joking Off”; and the well-received run of their Viceland talk show, which came to an abrupt end this past summer.Now they have more resources than ever at their disposal as well as more demands on their time, and they’re trying to grow a wider viewership without looking like corporate sellouts or losing the spontaneity that won them their earliest fans.After two consecutive days of 12-hour-long shoots, Desus said, “We are exhausted. Which means the podcast is going to be extra stupid.”Mero added that fatigue seemed to improve their extemporaneous approach to comedy. “It’s just freestyling,” he said. “The more exhausted we are, the more ridiculous and random it gets.”Desus and Mero spoke further about their preparation for their Showtime series, their rapid ascent and their departure from Viceland. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.You’re days away from the debut of your Showtime series but still recording episodes of your podcast. Do you really need to keep doing it?DESUS NICE It doesn’t feel like an obligation. If the TV show is the actual basketball game, the podcast is like warm-ups. You toss stuff out, shoot around.THE KID MERO A lot of characters and ideas are born in the podcast.DESUS We’ve always done the podcast, probably always will do the podcast. We’re going to be on episode 10,468. Doing our Vegas residency. Cardi B’s daughter headlining for us. [old man voice] “Give it up for Kulture. Y’all remember us?”MERO “Excuse me, my diverticulitis is acting up.”DESUS Also, we’re getting paid to do it, so it’s not hard.MERO Thank you for helping me escape poverty. Appreciate it.ImageDesus, left, and Mero, right, in the writers room. “When we started, we’re sitting at a table, Googling ‘how to make TV show.’ It’s a little intimidating,” said Desus.CreditJoel Barhamand for The New York TimesDoes having all these past podcast episodes mean you’ll come into the Showtime series with a ton of material?DESUS We haven’t really stockpiled anything for the Showtime show. Our writers might take one idea from the podcast and blow it up into a sketch. It’s like a crack house, basically. We have the writers bagging up for us. “Here’s a brick — break it down.”MERO Our writers are all sitting in a room, naked, writing sketches.DESUS I loved “Key & Peele,” but that was them playing these characters. Here, it’s just us. Desus and Mero as TSA agents. Desus and Mero as the Secret Service.MERO We’re not trying to be other people.DESUS We’re not good actors. But we’re probably the best actors out of the Bronx.How will the new show be different from your Viceland series?DESUS You don’t mess up the recipe if it’s working. We basically took that and blew it up. Production values are bigger. We’re going to leave the studio more. And I don’t want to brag but we got the best interviews in the game.MERO Before, it was like opening up your phone: “Who do you know?”DESUS “Tonight’s guest: Papi from the bodega!” “Uh, I’m just here to deliver your sandwich.” But now, Showtime’s like, “who do you want as a guest?” That used to be a joke.How did you go about hiring your staff for this show?DESUS When we started, we’re sitting at a table, Googling “how to make TV show.” It’s a little intimidating.MERO I’m going to get super, crystal-energy stupid on you right now. It was just, how do we feel about this person? What’s our dynamic, the three of us together? Because there were people that came in with impressive resumes, and it was just like, you’ve never even heard of us.DESUS We would be like, “The brand is— ” They would be like, “Available for purchase?”Your Viceland TV series started in late 2016, and by the summer of 2018, you had your deal with Showtime. Why make the move so quickly?DESUS The contract was just up. Then Showtime came.MERO It’s funny because people are trying to spin it into this really contentious, weird thing. And it’s like, no, dude, that’s just the business. The contract’s up, you renegotiate, there’s suitors.DESUS It’s Hollywood, baby. Other places would be like, “We want to make a show and put you in it.” Where Showtime was like, “We don’t want to change it up — we just want to help you elevate it.” There’s never been a moment where Showtime got in the way of anything. At the same time, they’re not stupid hands-off, like waiting for us to show up.MERO Here’s money, we don’t know what to do with it!DESUS The other show was so much heavy lifting that was just us. But now, having other people working around you and helping, it’s a weight off your shoulders. You’re free to move. We’re moving the ball around, they’re getting us open, we’re getting those good looks now.Showtime is mostly known for dramas like “Homeland” and “Ray Donovan,” and hasn’t ever had a proper late-night series before. Were you concerned that they’d be the right fit for you?DESUS At first, we thought we’re going to stick out like a sore thumb. Showtime’s not that well-known in the hood.MERO [goofy voice] “Is that where ‘Power’ be at?”Image“If we didn’t get a TV deal, we’d probably be in front of a bodega,” said Desus.CreditJoel Barhamand for The New York TimesDESUS But they’re definitely getting browner on that channel. They got “The Chi,” “Black Monday” with Don Cheadle, who we were just hanging with. We saw him and he was like, “Hey, co-worker.”MERO We’re opening them up to an audience they might not reach, and they’re opening us up to an audience we might not reach.DESUS The problem is, trying anything in late-night literally means making the same show. Even us, we thought about it. Should we just do the regular late-night thing? Come out in suits, have the house band? It works. There’s definitely an audience for it. But there’s also the audience for something else, and that’s where we come in.You never felt you had to give up any part of your voice or identity to make the show reach a broader audience?MERO You’ll know when that’s us. When we’re like, “Brought to you by Clorox toilet-bowl cleanser.”DESUS This is fun because it wasn’t put together by a corporate office. We started together. When we were at Complex, the show would be done and we’d both get on that 6 train. We’re just riffing back and forth and some guy’s sitting there, listening to us, and he’s like, “You guys are funny. You guys should do something with it.” At that time, we didn’t believe in the podcast. We were like, “Ah, shut the [expletive] up. You like what you see? Clap. You don’t like what you see, don’t clap.”MERO It was literally just supplementary income. I had two kids — he had back rent. We needed that extra couple hundred bucks to make life work.DESUS If us right now went back and told us from Complex that we’d have a Showtime deal, we’d be like, “Get the [expletive] outta here. And empty those pockets.”MERO “Is that the new iPhone? Oh, you got AirPods? I don’t even know what those are.”DESUS It’s like a reflex at this point. Just put us anywhere, man. If we didn’t get a TV deal, we’d probably be in front of a bodega. “Yo, those two bums are hilarious!”MERO But they smell like urine."
5c506a9b3a125f5075c06e47,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/arts/television/kimmy-schmidt-netflix.html,"The end of a TV show can mean a lot of things for an actor: the end of getting your hair done for free, the end of eating hot snacks for free, the end of free time spent napping in your trailer. But it also means something more poignant: the end of your character’s journey. (At least until the show’s reboot.) While television characters are immortal in a way — living on even after the show is done — when the story reaches its conclusion, so, too, does the time an actor has spent getting to know the characters in that world. When I learned that the fourth season of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” would be its last, I felt sad to have to say goodbye to Kimmy. While rumors of a possible movie help to cushion the blow, still, the series itself is over.I have been a cast member of two television shows that have ended. (I swear it’s just a coincidence that when I’m on a show, it ends.) The first one, “The Office,” wrapped up way back in 2013, when you didn’t order your deodorant online. I cried every single day for the final month of filming. I would drive home on the 101 in my Ford Fusion, blasting “Ada” by the National and “Wild Horses” by the Rolling Stones. As the tears streamed down my face, I would wave away concerned motorists giving me the universal “Are you O.K.?” gesture (yes, that’s right, I’m confident that’s what the gesture meant).What was happening to me? I hadn’t even been on the show since its start; I entered at the end of the fifth season. Jobs end, people move on. Why, then, did I feel as though I were leaving home for the first time? And why did I ever think that a Ford Fusion was the car for me? It’s way too wide!A year later, filming the pilot episode of what would become “Kimmy,” I told myself to get my act together. Back on “The Office,” I could get away with blubbering like a little baby because I was the newbie. I had never had a job as a recurring character on a TV show, and I had the entire cast to show me the way. My main objective was to stay quiet and try not to derail the train.ImageThe cast of “Kimmy Schmidt,” clockwise from left, Jane Krakowski, Kemper, Carole Kane and Tituss Burgess.CreditEric Liebowitz/NetflixHere on  “Kimmy Schmidt,” I was Kimmy Schmidt. I was the lead! I knew that my fellow cast members (the up-and-comer Jane Krakowski, the Broadway “veteran” Tituss Burgess, someone named Carol Kane) would look to me for guidance and leadership. I understood that as the show’s rock and foundation, I was the one to whom my crew, the production staff, the meek and timid Teamsters union would look for inspiration. I closed my eyes and nodded, thinking of all the great wisdom I could share with Tina Fey.Cue record scratch. Obviously. While I was playing the title character, the real stars of “Kimmy Schmidt” were its creators, Robert Carlock and Tina Fey. The cast featured a band of showbiz heavyweights. We had guest stars like Joanna Gleason and Peter Riegert. I guess the point I’m trying to make is not only does a person never stop learning, but also a person should never, ever refer to herself as the “rock” for a Teamster.On the final day of shooting, our production crew thoughtfully tried to schedule scenes that included as many cast members as possible so that we could all be together at wrap. When we finished at 11 that night, there were toasts and champagne and lots of people stealing props when they thought our prop department wasn’t looking.As I weirdly remarked to Ted Sarandos (the chief content officer of Netflix) a few nights ago at our wrap party, this feels like the end of an era. Was it necessary for me to share my emotional thoughts with the head of Netflix content? It was not. Do I feel like a lot has changed since “Kimmy” first started streaming on Netflix four years ago? I sure do.In no particular order, here are some of the invaluable lessons I learned from the people I worked with.Carol KaneImage“Carol always puts her performance first and eliminates any distractions that might interfere with that priority,” Kemper writes.CreditEric Liebowitz/NetflixA star of “Hester Street” and “Taxi,” Carol taught me that though there are many, many details swirling about a television show, the actor’s primary job is to perform. I know this sounds obvious, but the truth is, actors spend a lot of time waiting and not that much time performing. Carol always puts her performance first and eliminates any distractions that might interfere with that priority. Happily, she does not consider me showing her endless iPhone pictures of my 2-year-old son a distraction. She is a very patient national legend.Jane KrakowskiImageKemper: “I had a crush on Jane long before meeting her, and you know how they say never meet your heroes? Well, they’re wrong.”CreditEric Liebowitz/NetflixI had a crush on Jane long before meeting her, and you know how they say never meet your heroes? Well, they’re wrong. Jane was everything I had hoped for and more. She taught me the importance of being prepared, of doing your homework, of knowing your stuff. Sadly, she has not yet taught me how to do the splits (something she can do with alarming ease). Next show.Tituss BurgessImageTo Kemper, Burgess represents “a weird mix of my grandfather, my old field hockey coach and Luke Perry.”CreditEric Liebowitz/NetflixAll I ever want is for Tituss to approve of me, to love me. I crave his attention, and a smile from him will have me soaring all day. He apparently represents to me a weird mix of my grandfather, my old field hockey coach and Luke Perry, and all this shall be unpacked in a future therapy session. For now, he showed me how to speak up for what I want. I often stay quiet, thinking it’s the polite thing to do, and Tituss has taught me that making your wants known is not the same thing as being rude.Robert Carlock and Tina FeyLook, these two made a comedy about a woman who was kidnapped and held underground for 15 years. The show is about what happens after that. How do you continue to move forward after experiencing a tragedy? And how on earth do you manage to make any of it funny? The greatest compliment that any of us receives is when someone tells us that the show has helped her through a difficult time. All of the core characters have gone through some sort of upheaval, and they all come out on the other side intact, resilient, determined to make a go of it. In my own personal life, I have been very fortunate. To understand the true depth of Kimmy’s tenacity and courage is something I might never fully be able to do. But to be a part of a show that seems to make people feel better is one of the highest honors I’ve had. And all that is because Robert and Tina work tirelessly to make it right.Steve BuscemiThere exists in the universe a naturally occurring phenomenon known as “The Buscemi Effect.” What happens is, whenever you are within 40 feet of Steve Buscemi, you suddenly start to feel great. Steve directed an episode of “Kimmy” in Season 2, and he even made a cameo in one of the final episodes. I have tried to understand precisely what makes this man so very charismatic, but I cannot. And so instead, I pass along this advice: At least once in your life, try to stand within 40 feet of Steve Buscemi."
5c700ed13a125f5075c0b05c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/movies/pen15-eighth-grade-middle-school-girls.html,"It begins innocently enough. In the third episode of the Hulu comedy “PEN15,” the seventh grader Maya is playing with two My Little Pony dolls, mashing their pink plastic faces together in a fantasy make-out session, when her face flushes pink, too. For maybe the first time, she sticks a hand down her underwear, and for the remainder of the 30-minute episode, that hand rarely re-emerges. Suddenly Maya’s suburban middle school existence is pulsing with masturbation triggers: a pencil hole drilled into a purple eraser; a classmate’s ear hair; the curve of a sand dune in a nature documentary. A switch has flipped. Now everything is sex.In the middle school of the American collective imagination, packs of filthy-minded boys stalk the halls, snapping bras and howling at the cliff’s edge of puberty. The sex-obsessed adolescent girl is a rarer breed. More often girls are positioned as victims of raging male hormones, or else they are styled as preternaturally mature, rising above the boys and their juvenile misadventures. Now — in “PEN15,” the film “Eighth Grade” and the Netflix animated comedy “Big Mouth” — the lustful adolescent girl is having her moment.ImageThe sex-obsessed adolescent girl is a rarer breed in the pop-culture portrayal of middle school, but shows like “PEN15” (starring Anna Konkle, left) are giving her a moment.CreditAlex Lombardi/HuluIt is not, to be clear, an altogether glorious time. At least, it’s not for the girls themselves. Trapped in the years between childhood and adulthood, they are realizing that women are valued for their sex appeal, but do not yet know how to look or feel sexy. They think about boys constantly, but aren’t actually ready to touch them. They pursue sex and romance aggressively, but almost exclusively in their imaginations.Though polished and popular girls — fitted with thongs, coated in lip gloss and paired with boyfriends — exist in their worlds, they might as well belong to a different species. Our girls are awkward and weird. They are undergoing orthodontic treatments. They have made out with every bedpost and doorframe in their bedrooms.ImageKnowing that Elsie Fisher, the star of “Eighth Grade,” was in the same life stage as her character when filming only magnifies the movie’s anxious, claustrophobic feel.CreditLinda Kallerus/A24Through their eyes, it is the boys who become smooth, uncomplicated objects. Kayla, the slump-shouldered loner at the heart of “Eighth Grade,” is stupefied by her crush, and when his puny body emerges glistening from a pool, it is in slow motion and set to thumping stripper music. Meanwhile, the seventh-grade BFFs of “PEN15,” Maya Ishii-Peters and Anna Kone — played, with an absurd and haunting realism, by the 31-year-old writer-actors Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle — are entranced by the sun-kissed nape of a small boy on the kickball field. These boys don’t have much going for them; their personalities range from vacant to misanthropic. But they are genetically and socially blessed with whatever the middle school idea of “hot” is, and that is a gift that eludes our girls.In the second episode of “PEN15,” Maya finds herself in a closet make-out scenario with a boy, and when she unclamps her dripping retainer from her mouth, the boy flashes a look of such genuine disgust that you can’t help but feel empathy for both parties. We have seen a version of this dynamic before — it is a staple of the teen movie (à la “She’s All That” and “Never Been Kissed”) for the popular kid to be forced into intimate contact with a loser — but here our alliances have shifted. While it’s clear that Maya has been unfairly ranked in the middle school sexual hierarchy — her “Ace Ventura” impression is criminally underrated — we also recognize that on some level, she is not ready to kiss a boy. And the boy, for his part, seems neither overly judgmental nor indiscriminately sex-obsessed. Through him we see that girls can be revolting, too.ImageThe central conceit of “Big Mouth” — pubescent kids are visited by animated hormone monsters — helps to situate its boys and girls as equals.CreditNetflixOften tween boys and girls are isolated into separate spheres, portrayed as alien to each other and to adults. But these properties reveal much of adolescent culture that can be shared. When Kayla in “Eighth Grade” finally connects with a boy, it is over their mutual love of the Adult Swim animated comedy “Rick and Morty.” “PEN15” gets its name from the PEN15 Club — a made-up institution that exists to trick other kids to write “penis” on their hands — and the show reveals that such juvenile antics are not exclusive to one gender.“Big Mouth” is fashioned like a psychedelic coed sex-ed class, which is where the show begins. The first episode is about ejaculation; the second takes on menstruation. Though it is mostly about boys, the show smartly acknowledges that girls are experiencing analogous, if not precisely similar, issues. (The same cannot be said of its predecessors: “Freaks & Geeks,” for instance, never privileged girls as members of its younger geek crowd.) The central conceit of “Big Mouth” — pubescent kids are visited by animated hormone monsters that goad them into furious masturbation, crude flirtation attempts and irrational outbursts — helps to situate its boys and girls as equals. They’re simply operating under separate influences: The boys are mostly visited by Maury the Hormone Monster (voiced by Nick Kroll), while the girls are counseled by Connie the Hormone Monstress (Maya Rudolph).ImageIn “PEN15,” the 30-something creators, Konkle (left) and Maya Erskine, play seventh-grade best friends with an absurd and haunting realism.CreditAlex Lombardi/HuluThough these are all comedies, they take their horny girls quite seriously. In “PEN15,” the adults who play Maya and Anna are supported by a cast of real middle schoolers. This could easily be played as a sight gag, but instead the choice resonates deeply. It works to punctuate the moment when girls’ growth spurts send them towering over boys, and it dramatizes Maya and Anna’s outsider status at an age when kids seem capable of sniffing out difference on a cellular level.The hyper-realistic style of “Eighth Grade” delivers its own emotional gut punch. The 14-year-old Kayla is played by Elsie Fisher, who was herself 14 when she shot the film. Though Kayla makes YouTube videos for an audience in the single digits, and Fisher is a professional performer, knowing that character and actor are both stuck in the same life stage only magnifies the film’s anxious, claustrophobic feel. Jessi of “Big Mouth” is, of course, a cartoon, which allows the character to careen dramatically between adolescence and maturity. When she gets her period on a field trip to the Statue of Liberty, she is a steel cage of emotional control, but the second she enters her mother’s car after school, she melts into a sub-verbal puddle.These stories are each inspired by slightly different eras, and watched together, they reveal a complex relationship among girls, sex and technology. Though “Big Mouth” is set in the present, it is heavily influenced by the early 1990s adolescence of its creators, and modern technologies take a back seat in its plots. “PEN15” is set in the year 2000, around the time Erskine and Konkle entered middle school, and its girls access the heady adult world through dial-up AOL and Ask Jeeves. Kayla of “Eighth Grade,” meanwhile, rarely releases her grip on her iPhone, and her puberty is mediated through YouTube, Tumblr and Instagram. In one memorable scene, she types “how to give a blow job” into the YouTube search bar, deletes it, and tries instead: “how to give a good blow job.”New technologies are typically framed as accelerators for the sexual corruption of girls, but here their risks are linked inextricably to great rewards. For the girls of “PEN15,” who together pretend to be a “hot” 26-year-old woman in a chat room, AOL is a portal to disembodied sexual exploration, a way to digitally map out imaginary adult sex lives without actually exposing them to stranger danger. And though it can be painful to watch Kayla lying in her dark bedroom, mainlining her classmates’ Instagram feeds on her phone, it is merely an embodied version of the fantasies that have always thrilled and haunted middle school girls. The “Big Mouth” indifference to technology is its own form of commentary: Social media, it seems to say, just can’t compete with the wild physical and emotional forces of adolescence.Even for a woman who was once a girl like them — I, too, practiced kissing the back of my hand when my mouth was jammed with wires and rubber bands — there can be a frisson of anxiety to actually seeing their private moments revealed onscreen. The default pop cultural perspective remains that of the adult man, and from his vantage point, exposing adolescent female sexuality onscreen can feel predatory or perverted. These comedies have little interest in considering how those men will feel when they are transported into a girl’s bedroom. Girls’ feelings matter, too. And these girls feel so much."

Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.ImageCreditPete Marovich for The New York Times1. The partial government shutdown is entering its third week.Negotiations between Vice President Mike Pence and congressional aides from both parties yielded little progress on Saturday. The two sides are scheduled to meet again this afternoon, but there is little reason to believe that President Trump’s demand for more than $5 billion for a wall at the southern border will be met anytime soon.The president’s fixation on a border wall, a favorite talking point since his campaign, has left him in a political box of his own making, our reporters write in a news analysis.If the partial shutdown continues a week longer, it will officially be the longest in U.S. history. Here’s a look at what is and isn’t affected by the shutdown.The government will remain partly shuttered until at least Tuesday, because both chambers of Congress are adjourned until then.Have you been keeping up with the headlines?

The shutdown has lasted a full pay cycle for the 800,000 federal employees who are not working or working without pay. Here’s what the shutdown would look like if it happened in other industries.The workers affected range from people earning $100,000 a year to those making a quarter of that. Many are frustrated with the impasse. “They have to realize that this affects everyday people,” said a corrections officer at a federal prison in Florida.Native American tribes are also being hit hard by the shutdown. Their treaties with the U.S. government guarantee funding for services like health care and education, and the work is often done by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal money, or by federal workers, some of whom are tribal citizens.

The stalemate over the border wall is an early test of the new political dynamic in Washington, where Democrats have just taken control of the House for the first time in eight years.While Democrats capitulated on an immigration issue just a few days into a shutdown early last year, they are looking at a more favorable Senate map in 2020, and do not seem to think there’s as much political risk in standing firm against President Trump.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, above, was elected speaker of the House on Thursday, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence.

The 2020 primary competition is underway, with Senator Elizabeth Warren now in the race and several other women likely to be contenders. Despite the so-called Year of the Woman and the midterm gains that followed, there’s a lingering worry among some Democrats about the risks of nominating a woman to take on President Trump. Above, Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, in Iowa.The Democratic primary is expected to draw an unusually large number of candidates. Our political correspondents look at who is likely to run and how timing changes everything.One potential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is now dealing with accusations that women working on his 2016 presidential campaign were sexually harassed and paid less than men.____ImageCreditDrew Angerer/Getty Images5. Investors received good news on Friday: The Labor Department reported one of the strongest months of job gains in a decade, with employers adding 312,000 jobs in December. And wages, which for months only inched up, have begun to increase more quickly.Stocks rose after the Labor Department announcement, and picked up even more after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged the market’s concerns about rising interest rates and said the Fed would remain flexible in the face of market turbulence and signs that the global economy is slowing.____ImageCreditvia Agence France-Presse — Getty Images6.

For the first time in 16 years, Apple reduced its revenue expectations, citing poor iPhone sales in China. It was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble. “Apple is a bellwether,” said a chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.Elsewhere in the business world, Tesla reported a record quarter on Wednesday and announced it was cutting prices of all models by $2,000.

When someone commits a crime, the police in New York City can have a victim or witness scroll through hundreds of mug shots matching the perpetrator’s description, in hopes the culprit is among them.But these open-ended photo searches can increase the likelihood of ensnaring an innocent person, and many other large police departments say they don’t rely on the technique.St. Clair Steward, above, was jailed for more than two months after a victim picked him from his mug shot, the 31st that he was shown. His case was dismissed after a DNA sample from the crime scene did not match his.____ImageCreditWarner Bros. Pictures, via Associated Press10.

5c3474ac3a125f5075c034e3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/style/millennial-marketing-wellness-recess.html,"Ease, comfort, and pleasure are what millennials, those members of the high-anxiety “Doom Generation,” really want — and capitalism is into it. A new beverage called Recess is a case study in where those desires meet. Bubbles? Yes. CBD? Check. Sans-serif block font? Yeah! A knowing, nudging, creepily on-point Instagram presence? Obviously.Recess is a sparkling water infused with CBD (government name: cannabidiol), a nonintoxicating hemp extract that is said to act as a pain reliever, anti-anxiety, anti-inflammatory and chillifier. The drink also contains adaptogens, ephemera from the neverland of is-it-food-or-not that are supposed to reduce stress and improve memory, focus and immunity. Their efficacy is without definitive evidence, but both CBD and adaptogens are decidedly a thing in functional health and wellness — and their marketing.Recess is headquartered in New York City and made in the Hudson Valley (it was formulated in Beacon and is produced in Fishkill). The company was founded and is still owned by a millennial named Benjamin Witte, who previously worked in tech marketing in San Francisco.In the era before the commodified wellness movement, this kind of drink would have been tucked into the dimmest refrigerated corner of the spookiest health-food store, not in high demand at $29.99 for a six pack. (The company has since caught up, but Recess says that a few weeks after its October start it had 4,000 back-orders.) Now, the mania for CBD (and the vague curiosity about adaptogens) means that Recess — the matte, sunset palette of the cans as appealing as a luxury lip gloss or free candy or a toy car — has lit up the shifting aspirations of the middle and upper classes of millennials.First You Must Speak Millennial“We canned a feeling,” breathes the copy on the Recess website. The site uses phrases like “the unlikely friendship we’re here for” and, regarding a sample pack, “for those who fear commitment,” channeling the half-embarrassed self-aware sincerity that defines the millennial mood.The site, social media and product all read, “Calm Cool Collected,” an apparent mantra and tagline that is all feeling, all affect, all in the soothing lexicon of self-improvement that proliferates on platforms like Instagram. Recess offers a product that’s addressing the midafternoon dip otherwise fulfilled by a cigarette, a coffee or a cookie (or, actually getting high). And this is all after it riffs on the childhood memory of a daily routine break.Now That You Have Their Attention, Add Some CarbonationAlcohol-free, caffeine-free, sugar-free (or almost sugar-free) convenience drinks are, inexplicably, a rare commodity.A partial solve is in carbonated mineral water, sparkling water and seltzer. (They’re all different, but let’s keep it moving.) Perrier has added orange and strawberry and other flavors to the usual lemon and lime. Spindrift has real fruit. But it’s LaCroix that seems to be desired by millennials more cohesively and completely than anything else, including the toast spread with the fatty fruit of which we dare not speaketh.Recess builds on LaCroix’s desirability, if not its accessibility. Its sales are largely driven by e-commerce, with limited IRL availability in New York, while LaCroix can be found in most major supermarkets and corner shops. Both brands sell flavor, tribal identity and a pause. Their liquid-speedy opposites, the endless lineup of “energy” drinks, feel very Empire-era outdated in the context of ascendant millennial wellness.Promise Less Anxiety (Sigh)Sparkling water may be an easier, more appealing way into wellness for the uninitiated than herbs, oils, pills and powders. (The effects of these substances are still being studied, so it’s worth reviewing with a medical professional before you try them.)The growth of the wellness industry is often attributed to Gen-X celebrities on the back nine of their careers. The natural participants, however, are people in their 20s and 30s, who have never known the promise of life improving economic stability, or job security; whose lives are ordered by debt so unwieldy as to be abstract; who, instead of aspiring toward power in its familiar forms, want relief — a general softening of life — and prefer sober dance parties, life-hacking podcasts and bullet journals. A can of seltzer is just another opportunity to sell them a release from cares.Do It for the LikesRecess’s website features the charms of vaporwave internet art and Lisa Frank-style nostalgia, while their Instagram account evokes the combined look of “Endless Summer” with “Floridian retiree” and the summer-camp psychedelia that has replaced “Lifestyle Lumberjack” as the default millennial style choice. One post features a productless shot, a 1970s-Hockney-gone-surrealist composition involving a half-dog, half-cat collaged onto shadowy pinks and babied blues, as discomfiting and mesmerizing as anything else on Weird Instagram right now.Is the brand in on the joke, spinning millennial nu-irony for likes and sales, or completely earnest? Definitely both. The pastel-dream lifestyle is pitched sincerely (and received accordingly, by millennials who find comfort in fluffy-cloud aesthetics) but the product and marketing still exist within the general boundaries of detached and ironized millennial sentiment, where the warmth is simultaneously demanded and mocked.The brand’s social-media marketing also features a series of nanoinfluencers — appropriately attractive and appealing unpaid friends or friends-of-friends of the founder, some of them reclining and unwinding, some doing their creative work and talking about it for the ’gram.Design but Make it *Cute*The three available flavors — “peach ginger,” “pom hibiscus” and “blackberry chai” — roll on a continuum alongside the rose gold of an iPhone 6s Plus; now-washed “millennial pink,” the signature color of capitalized feminism (think #GIRLBOSS; think Thinx); this-very-moment’s power lavender; the diluted, creamy rose of Glossier-ed cheek and lip products (and, the brand’s cult-y pink pouches, made of glorified Bubble Wrap for a bonus A.S.M.R. experience); and Pantone’s 2019 Color of the Year, “Living Coral,” a warm, gold-ish pink. The colorway references the pastels that defined hip-hop fashion five years ago (as always, rap got there first) and the material culture of 1980s and 1990s, so, “youth” for millennials. The brand’s minimalist typography is similarly familiar from and to the visual culture of start-ups and other (largely direct-to-consumer) brands like Outdoor Voices and Casper. Recess also uses a chummy script-style logo and an intentionally awkward sans-serif block type, similar to the shoe brand Allbirds, affirming the current sensibility of young (or youngish: the oldest millennials are 38!) creative people and those who dress like them.But Does It Work?In the end, whatever creates this affective experience is invaluable. It’s actually really, really hard to find some branded unit of identity to buy that feels good, looks good, is worth what it costs and doesn’t seem to compromise anyone else’s human dignity. When a product like Recess seems to fulfill a millennial consumer’s desires, we’re in."
5c87757249f0eacbf105c908,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/books/review/namwali-serpell.html,"Maybe because we’re living in a dystopia, it feels as if we’ve become obsessed with prophecy of late. Protest signs at the 2017 Women’s March read “Make Margaret Atwood Fiction Again!” and “Octavia Warned Us.” News headlines about abortion bans and the defunding of Planned Parenthood do seem ripped from the pages of Atwood’s novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” (1985). And Octavia Butler’s “Parable” series, published in the 1990s, did eerily feature a presidential candidate who vows to “make America great again.”In “The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World,” Thomas Disch calls this relay between fiction and reality “creative visualization.” Businesses have started to co-opt it. The designers of the iPhone and the Kindle cite works of science fiction as inspiration. Boeing, Nike, Ford and Intel have hired prototyping, future-casting or world-building ventures for product development. As the author Brian Merchant put it on Medium recently, these companies “do what science fiction has always done — build rich speculative worlds, describe that world’s bounty and perils, and, finally, envision how that future might fall to pieces.” This is “speculative” fiction in the financial sense, too, a new way to gamble on futures.The irony — or the proof — of this brave new business model is that sci-fi saw it coming. Dystopias have long portrayed artists being drafted into nefarious corporate labor. In “Blade Runner 2049,” for instance, the Wallace Corporation sets a woman the task of crafting memories — not for characters in a novel, but for androids.It’s a touch self-congratulatory for sci-fi creators to imply that they’re the unacknowledged designers of the world. But they do seem to have a knack for innovation. The genre has predicted satellite communication, army tanks, tablets, submarines, psychotropic pills, bionic limbs, CCTV, electric cars and video calling. You can find dozens more examples of sci-fi-minted gadgetry on the internet, which is itself a prime example of the phenomenon. The word “cyberspace” first appeared in the cyberpunk novel “Neuromancer” (1984), to describe “a consensual hallucination …. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.” Its author, William Gibson, is our Nostradamus: His novels have prophesied reality television, viral marketing and nanotechnology.I write science fiction set in the near future, so I’m constantly testing my own powers of prophecy. I once wrote a story about a germaphobic couple who want to have sex without touching. They purchase the “TouchFeely” — my nod to the “Feelies” in Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” (1932) — an apparatus that includes an electrified dildo and a sheath that respond remotely to each other. The year after the story came out, I learned about Hera and Zeus, “the world’s first internet-enabled” sex toys. These “teledildonic” devices uncannily resemble my fictional invention. I was a little disconcerted. My story is a satire about bourgeois disconnection. My characters each start affairs with the bot. One ends up choking on the dildo. But I’ll confess: I felt a perverse pleasure, too. It was as if I had conjured something into existence — the dream of every artist.More recently, I did some research on H.I.V. vaccines for my novel, “The Old Drift.” With some help from a biologist at New York University, I came up with one that uses a particular technique to target a specific gene sequence. I felt a strange, and, again, perverse, mix of horror and wonder when I read a couple months ago that Chinese scientists had used the exact same mechanism for their “AIDS vaccine development project,” also known as the CRISPR babies, the first genetically modified humans. I’ve started to worry that, before long, the Moskeetoze(TM) microdrones that I designed for the novel will buzz to life too. Raymond Z. Gallun’s 1936 short story “The Scarab” got there first, but the TV series “Black Mirror” introduced robo-bees into the popular imagination just in advance of their emergence in the real world: Last March, Walmart filed a patent for a fleet of pollination drones.This is the dark side of science fiction prophecy. “Wow, I was right!” can turn quickly into “Yikes, I was right!” You almost envy Cassandra, the Trojan princess who was doomed by the gods to be always correct yet disbelieved. “I was never able to predict,” William Gibson demurred in an interview with GQ. “But I could sort of curate what had already happened.” When it was brought to his attention that the global disasters he had envisioned in his 2014 novel, “The Peripheral,” seemed to be happening even before it was published, Gibson admitted: “That makes me very uncomfortable.”What if you don’t just predict a bad idea but inspire it? Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” (1818), widely considered the first science fiction novel, tried to forestall this: “Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge.” But while science fiction aims to warn, humans are teenagers at heart: We love doing what we’re told not to. Our modern-day “Frankenstein,” Michael Crichton’s “Jurassic Park” (1990), may even have spurred researchers to try to recover dinosaur DNA. Should the makers of sci-fi quit indulging this desire to peer into the future?Well, no. First of all, our predictions are off a lot of the time. No one’s floating around in jet packs and hovercrafts just yet. Huxley presaged genetic engineering — his test tube babies are the true precursors of CRISPR babies — but so far we’ve passed on his multisensory “Feelies” and stuck with the good old-fashioned movies. For some reason, there’s a slew of older sci-fi films that happen to be set in 2019 — “Blade Runner,” “The Running Man,” “The Island” — so we have new proof of our flubs. The IGN piece detailing these failures of prophecy is titled “The Sci-Fi Movies That Predicted 2019 … and Got It Wrong.”The writer Harry Turtledove tweeted a link to that article with an exclamatory comment: “Science fiction does not predict the future. Not. Not! [expletive] NOT! It uses the imagined future to comment on the real present.” Margaret Atwood often claims something similar, echoing Gibson’s protestations. Despite manifest evidence of her acute forecasts — the rise of the Christian right, in vitro meat, sexbots modeled on real people, apocalyptic climate change, live aquatic jewelry — she says: “I’m not a prophet. Honest, I’m not a prophet. If I were a prophet I would have cleaned up on the stock market years ago. … They’re saying things about ‘Oryx and Crake’ and ‘MaddAddam’ are all coming true. But that’s based on things people were already working on when I was writing the books. It’s just that I was looking for those things and other people weren’t.” Maybe science fiction’s future is actually just a lens on the present.Some writers do like to don the mantle of prophet. In 1983, Isaac Asimov published a set of 2019 forecasts. He was right about some things: “The mobile computerized object, or robot, is already flooding into industry and will, in the course of the next generation, penetrate the home.” But it’s embarrassing to see how hopeful he was about us: Asimov thought computers would have freed us from the most tedious forms of labor by now. He imagined we’d have fixed pollution, developed technology “based on the special properties of space” and even settled on the moon. This rosy picture might seem surprising, given science fiction’s proclivity for doom and gloom. Yet given our headlong plummet toward the death of this planet, to picture any future at all feels optimistic these days. It assumes that, when the apocalypse comes, we will still be here to witness it.Stories are one of our oldest technologies. They let us have vivid experiences — beautiful, moving ones, but also horrifying, dark ones — and then close the book, or the laptop, unscathed. They give us a kind of perverse pleasure in reverse: not of seeing the worst come true, but of seeing the worst without it coming true. And this is the other reason I don’t think writers should give up on the art of prediction. Writers don’t just see into the future or possess special insight into the present; we also construct a kind of machine for virtual hindsight. We create an immersive simulation of the future that we can all experience and look back on, so that we might decide together whether we want these dreams to come true after all."

But there is a woman in Paris whose job it is to make the platform look as appealing as possible to an industry that is all about beauty and image: Morin Oluwole, the global head of luxury for Facebook and Instagram.Because she is good at her job and because she is a rare combination in the technology sphere — a woman, a minority and a luxury brand acolyte — the company has been touting her as one of its public faces.Not an easy assignment. With Facebook drawing attention for its data practices and use of personal information to make money, Ms. Oluwole, 34, and her particular area of expertise — how to employ user’s data profiles for targeted advertising on Facebook and Instagram — have been encountering increased public scrutiny and pressure. So much so that she became visibly uncomfortable when the subject was broached.“It’s a false idea that there is a collection, there is a transfer, there is a sale of data to clients,” she said during a recent interview in a nondescript conference room at Facebook’s headquarters in the Paris’s Second Arrondissement. “Data is not transferred.” She stared, not blinking. “That’s super, super clear and very important.”Well, O.K.: Data might not be sold. But it is used. And luxury has benefited.When Ms. Oluwole opened her division four years ago, she said, she faced resistance from the old-school fashion names, long averse to digital novelty. Slowly, she earned executives’ trust — not only because she is a savvy marketer with a master’s degree in business administration from Columbia University, but also because she is a devoted luxury consumer. On the day of the interview, she had augmented her swishy navy Maje minidress with Chanel boots that had a golf-ball-size pearl suspended in each clear Lucite heel, a stainless-steel Rolex Datejust watch and a Louis Vuitton ring adorned with the initial M.Her iPhone was enveloped by a Goyard case. Her business card holder: Chanel. This season, she attended the Christian Dior and Berluti shows. “Luxury is what I do,” she said, “but it’s also part of my innate life.”Born in Lagos, Nigeria, to a family of doctors and lawyers, and educated in England, Ms. Oluwole joined Facebook in 2006, when she was a pre-med undergrad at Stanford University and the start-up was still an inter-university network with just 150 employees. In 2013, she saw the potential of the fashion world, and persuaded her then-boss Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, to establish a department focused squarely on the luxury sector.In 2015, Ms. Oluwole opened her two-person “global luxury hub” in Paris. She rented a small apartment in the hipster neighborhood of Montorgueil (and has since bought a home in the tony 16th Arrondissement) and enrolled in French classes at the Alliance Française.About the same time, Instagram hired Eva Chen, the well-connected former editor in chief of Lucky magazine, as director of fashion partnerships for the platform in New York. Ms. Chen’s brief has been to consult with fashionable figures, such as models, designers, stylists and celebrities, and help them create posts that increase their followers (her services are free).Ms. Oluwole runs the business side of the equation: counseling luxury brands on how to use Facebook and Instagram to their financial benefit, and she bills clients like advertising agencies do, based on consumer response, such as clicks per post.She said she doesn’t ever tell brands what the message should be. Instead, she said, “we build a 360-degree communication strategy for brands to share content and drive business value via targeted advertising.”That is how Ms. Oluwole talks: in jargon-heavy M.B.A.-speak that is, at times, hard to parse. Straight-backed and no-nonsense, she exudes authority. “And chic — she is so chic,” Ms. Chen said. “A great mix of strategy and style. Morin” — pronounced MUH-rhin — “understands all the different aspects of Facebook and Instagram.”Louis Vuitton and Dior were the first to grasp Ms. Oluwole’s pitch and sign on. Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Hermès and others soon followed. Her division has grown to 10 staff members in Paris, with satellite offices in New York, London, Milan, Dubai, Seoul, Tokyo and Hong Kong. She wouldn’t say how many brands are advertisers or partners on Facebook or Instagram but “we represent all the major players in the luxury business,” she said.Ms. Oluwole’s staff creates profiles — compiled from user information, like date of birth, ZIP code, education and work history, favorite music, pages followed — to pinpoint ad targets for brands. For several years, Facebook and Instagram also incorporated information from third-party brokers like Acxiom but such data compilation was banned when the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in the European Union in May.Facebook and Instagram were obliged to change their gathering process “across the board” to be compliant, Ms. Oluwole said: “We no longer get information from external sources. We can’t see what kind of car someone bought, because we don’t work with that data provider anymore.”But say you live in 90210 — Beverly Hills — and you “like” Tesla, Fendi and Peninsula Hotels. That would make you a bull’s-eye for Ms. Oluwole’s partners.“Facebook has all this data that you don’t realize they have,” said Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU’s Stern School of Business, and author of “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.” “They know you better than your doctor, priest and rabbi.” The problem, he said, is that “bad actors can weaponize that data,” as Cambridge Analytica proved last spring, when the London-based political consulting firm revealed that it had harvested personal data from millions on Facebook — specifics that investigators said swayed elections and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.No one is saying that Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Ms. Oluwole’s other clients are involved in anything similar. But it is true that she has built a business, and a lucrative one, on capturing user information and exploiting it to the profit of Facebook, Instagram and their luxury partners. While she would not specify the division’s revenue, she said her division’s piece of the Facebook pie was “quite significant” and added, brightly, “our potential is still large.”She is not the only one who thinks so. Last summer, YouTube hired the “CNN Style” host Derek Blasberg, and Snapchat lured Selby Drummond from her longtime editor’s post at American Vogue; they, too, have been charged with forging alliances with luxury, apparel and beauty brands.Data mining methods have caught the attention of regulatory agencies. One, Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, ruled last month that Facebook could no longer combine user data with information from its other platforms, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, without the person’s explicit consent. Facebook said it would appeal.Whatever the outcome, it may be moot. “These platforms used to be separate companies — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — with separate databanks,” Mr. Galloway said. “Now they are integrating their back ends — one back end and three different interfaces. And, in my mind, that is dangerous. Facebook will have all this data in one place. And it’s porous — it’s easy for others to access. “The Centers for Disease Control has your health records, but they took extraordinary measures to protect that data,” he said. “Facebook hasn’t done that.”(On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, announced in a blog post that Facebook soon would shift from public posts toward a more secure messaging system.)Other platforms have begun to muscle in on Ms. Oluwole’s territory. In August, Ms. Drummond had a preview of Adidas’s Falcon W shoe on a new Snapchat show called “Fashion 5 Ways;” the stock sold out in six hours. Mr. Blasberg teamed with Rihanna to stream her Savage x Fenty lingerie show on YouTube during New York Fashion Week last September; they further amped up the noise by packing the front row with popular social media influencers.As a result, Facebook is increasing its efforts — or, as Ms. Oluwole said, putting “more functionalities in the pipeline.” IGTV, or Instagram Television, is becoming a more important channel on the app. “Stories” are expanding at Facebook. And there is “Shopping,” a new Instagram tab dedicated to exactly that.“One day,” Ms. Oluwole said, technology will “create some sort of system that allows you to intelligently guess what the next items are that a consumer wants to purchase.” She looked excited. That time, she said, would be “great.”"

President Trump and Democratic leaders held a contentious meeting on Wednesday over the partial government shutdown, which is nearing the two-week mark and has affected 800,000 federal employees. Mr. Trump was adamant in his demands for $5.6 billion in funding for a border wall, and he rejected Democrats’ proposals to fund the government while the two sides negotiated further. The Democrats refused to increase their offer of $1.3 billion for border security.Mr. Trump asked congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, an official said.Go deeper: Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim the title of speaker of the House today. How she deals with Mr. Trump will define her tenure.The Daily: In today’s episode, Senator Chuck Schumer discusses the shutdown and the era of divided government. Claims of sexual harassment on the Sanders campaignWomen who worked for Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign in 2016 say that complaints of sexual harassment, demeaning treatment and pay disparities went unaddressed. One former staffer said she was marginalized after refusing a manager’s invitation to his hotel room. Asked if he knew about the staff complaints, Mr. Sanders told CNN, “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.” He added: “I certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time.”Why it matters: The Vermont senator’s perceived failure to address the issues could hinder any potential plans for another run in 2020.ImageThe first image of the far side of the moon taken by the Chinese probe Chang’e-4.CreditChina National Space Administration, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesChinese make history on the moonChina has reached a milestone in space exploration, landing a vehicle on the far side of the moon for the first time in history, the country’s space agency announced this morning. The probe, called Chang’e-4 after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology, made the first in a series of planned missions to make China a contender in the space race.

After a recent digital exchange, this writer looked into the history of one of his favored responses: “Roger that.”In the days of Morse code, an R was sent to indicate that a message had been received.ImageA commercial Morse code station in the U.S.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesThat system evolved with the introduction of radio communications. Early transmissions were often of poor quality, so, to avoid misunderstandings, spelling alphabets were developed. Also called phonetic alphabets, they replaced letters with words that started with the corresponding letter.By World War II, the U.S. and British militaries had settled on a standard: Able for A, Baker for B … and Roger for R. (Previously, the British had used Robert.)In the 1950s, a new alphabet — commonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet — was adopted, and is now the most widely used. It replaced Roger with Romeo. (I’m planning to stick with Roger.)That’s it for this briefing.

5c2ddd2b3a125f5075c02a68,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/technology/personaltech/tech-2019-overhyped.html,"Imagine a future where you are never truly alone. Even when your spouse is on a business trip or your children are away at summer camp, you will always have someone (or something) to talk to. In the morning, you could ask the microwave to heat up a bowl of oatmeal. In your car, you could tell your stereo to put on some ’90s music. And when you walk into the office, you could ask your smartphone, “What’s on my calendar today?”This is increasingly the world the tech industry is building with a bloating portfolio of devices that can react to voice commands — and that the companies will be pitching to you even more in 2019. The future will be on display next week at CES, a consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas that serves as a window into the year’s hottest tech trends. Artificially intelligent virtual assistants will take center stage as the most important tech topic, with companies big and small expected to showcase voice-controlled devices like robot vacuums, alarm clocks, refrigerators and car accessories. Most of these products will be powered by Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant, the two most popular artificially intelligent assistants, industry insiders said.“A.I. will pervade the show,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which owns CES. If this all sounds like a repeat of last year, that’s because much of it is. Artificial intelligence was 2018’s hottest tech trend, too. In other words, the tech industry is in a state of iteration rather than making leaps and bounds with something totally new. Other tech trends that are progressing include the debut this year of fifth-generation cellular networks, known as 5G, which will significantly quicken mobile internet speeds. Cybersecurity products for home networks are also proliferating, an important safeguard now that consumers own so many devices that can connect to the internet.But as is often the case, there will also be plenty of talk in the coming week about overly optimistic tech that you would do best to sidestep for now. That’s because some of the most hyped technologies — especially self-driving cars — are so far from reality that you won’t see them in stores or dealerships anytime soon.Here’s what to watch, and what to avoid.Battle of the virtual assistantsImageLast year, Amazon introduced a microwave powered by its Alexa virtual assistant.CreditChona Kasinger for The New York TimesIn 2015, Amazon birthed the Echo, the artificially intelligent speaker featuring the virtual assistant known as Alexa. A year later, Google responded with Home, its smart speaker powered by Google’s own digital companion, called Assistant. Since then, in a bid to become your go-to digital companion, the two tech giants have teamed up with makers of devices like thermostats, doorbells, light bulbs and car accessories to add their virtual assistants to them.Google is expected to be even more aggressive this year with its Assistant. The company will triple the size of its presence at CES this year, suggesting that it is likely to unveil a large array of products that work with Assistant.“We’re really leaning into the Assistant as the best way to get things done, helping you for lots of things as you go about your day,” said Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant.Amazon said it would also showcase a wide range of technologies that work with Alexa next week, as part of a vision it calls Alexa Everywhere. The company’s goal is to expand the reach of its virtual assistant into every part of people’s lives, including the kitchen, the living room, the office and the car. For you and me, here’s a cautionary note: Virtual assistants are still in their infancy and have many shortcomings. We have to speak a very specific command to trigger a virtual assistant to control a device, like setting the temperature on a thermostat or turning on a lamp. Those unfamiliar with the lingo may find the devices even more difficult to use than pressing a button inside an app.“We still have to learn their language, and they have not learned our language,” said Frank Gillett, a tech analyst for Forrester, a technology research company.Lost in the hype about virtual assistants is whether people truly want an omnipresent companion involved in their everyday tasks. Owners of smart speakers mostly summoned digital assistants for basic functions like listening to music, checking the weather and setting a timer, according to research by Nielsen last year.Security for your smart thingsPlenty of people install antivirus software on their computers. But what about all the other devices that can be connected to the internet, like smart watches, phones, televisions and speakers? In an era of smart things, the Wi-Fi router is becoming a bigger target for hackers, so expect a flood of new equipment and software that offer protection by improving your network security.For a sense of what to expect, consider Eero Plus, a subscription service that Eero, a maker of Wi-Fi equipment, released last year. Eero Plus includes protection against viruses and malware for all the devices connected to its Wi-Fi network. Last year, NetGear released NetGear Armor, a similar security service.More should follow this year — beginning next week at CES, where Scalys, a networking company, plans to introduce TrustBox, a router with built-in security features.The arrival of 5GImageCarriers like Verizon and AT&T said new network technology would deliver data at incredible speeds.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThis year, the wireless industry will begin a big upgrade to its infrastructure. Phone carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless say the 5G technology will deliver data at incredibly fast speeds, allowing people to download entire movies in a few seconds.In addition to increasing smartphone speeds, 5G will be important for other types of devices, like robots, self-driving cars, drones and security cameras. The technology is expected to greatly reduce latency, or the time it takes for devices to communicate with one another.But don’t get too excited. Carriers say the new network technology will be deployed this year in only a few cities in the United States, and in some parts of Britain, Germany, Switzerland, China, South Korea and Australia. And not many smartphones will be compatible with 5G initially. Some Chinese handset makers and Samsung Electronics have said they will release their first 5G smartphones this year. Apple is not expected to release a 5G-compatible iPhone until 2020.“For the early adopters with deep pockets, that’s great,” Mr. Gillett said. “For the rest of us, big whoop.”Here’s what is still overhypedVirtual reality and self-driving cars have been talked about a lot in recent years, and they will still be talked about this year. But these two technologies are still nascent or premature.Over the last two years, tech companies like Facebook’s Oculus, HTC, Google and Samsung have flooded the market with virtual reality headsets and plenty of software and games. Yet people have not exactly embraced the products.“The industry has been plagued by high-cost hardware, motion sickness, a dearth of compelling content and a general lack of consumer interest,” said Victoria Petrock, an analyst for the research firm eMarketer, in a recent post.Self-driving cars are also still many years from becoming mainstream. Even though some companies have permits to test autonomous cars in California, Arizona and elsewhere, several of the leaders in the technology — such as Alphabet’s Waymo — have refrained from committing to a release date for self-driving vehicles.“There’s going to be a lot of noise about automotive technology, but nothing distinct or specific,” Mr. Gillett said.

5c964f8349f0eacbf105eaab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/us/transgender-women-border-mexico.html,"MEXICALI, Mexico — In the pictures, Jess Enriquez Taylor wears artful makeup and her hair is carefully styled. But her face was bare as she rode the bus toward the international border one recent afternoon, and her long black hair was tucked under a hat.One of her hands was painted with glittering nail polish, but she kept it folded and out of sight. She used the hand with no polish to point to the images on her cellphone.“This is me, this is who I really am. When I get out of here, I transform,” she said of the photos, taken on the other side of the border, in the United States.ImageMs. Taylor crosses the border into the United States regularly.Crossing between Mexico and the United States is an everyday practice for people living in the border towns of the Southwest. But for transgender women like Ms. Taylor, who is Mexican but grew up in the United States, crossing between countries also requires her to move uncomfortably between genders.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]Ms. Taylor, 39, cannot afford an apartment in California, but her family and neighbors in Mexicali demand that she live essentially as a man. She has not told her family she is preparing to undergo hormone replacement therapy, and going home to her brother’s house means wiping her face clean of cosmetics, changing her hair and, when outsiders are present, avoiding the feminine adjectives that women use in Spanish. Her family in Mexico makes her use separate dishes for fear she carries sexually transmitted diseases, a common and bigoted misconception about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Rather than go back to Mexico regularly, she chooses to be homeless in America, sleeping on friends’ couches or sometimes in someone’s garage.ImageMs. Taylor put on her makeup at her mother's apartment in Calexico, Calif., as clients of her mother, a dressmaker, inspected a wedding dress. Her mother tolerates her daughter's gender identity, but she lives in subsidized housing for the elderly and is not allowed to have anyone else live there.“It’s easier to not know where I’m going to end up than to come to Mexicali. I can’t be myself here,” she said as the bus made its way toward the international border crossing at Calexico, Calif. If she wants to be safe in Mexico, she said, “this is how I have to be.”Intolerance toward homosexuality and nontraditional gender identities are woven into the culture in parts of Mexico, where the Catholic Church, a powerful force, describes such orientations as sinful. Mexicali, a large city of one million, is not ultraconservative: The city has several gay and lesbian nightclubs, for instance. But even as cities across Mexico become more tolerant — with big gay and lesbian communities emerging in Mexico City and Oaxaca — transgender women are still treated with derision. Physical attacks are not uncommon, and they often go unpunished.In California’s agrarian Imperial Valley, transgender women, many of whose extended families are just across the border in Mexicali, say they feel greater safety from physical violence and harassment because of American laws and cultural norms. Yet the question of simply moving to the United States is not a simple one, even for those, like Ms. Taylor, who have green cards. Life can be prohibitively more expensive compared with the cost of living in Mexico. And the Imperial Valley, one of the most fertile farm regions in the United States, can be rather quiet because it is so rural.ImageMs. Taylor cooks dinner with her mother at her mother's apartment.“It’s kind of like a double-edged sword,” Ms. Taylor said. “Mexico is really old-fashioned and there’s a lot of machismo. In Mexicali you get discrimination, but yet you can party. In Imperial Valley you don’t get discrimination, but you have few places to go.”And so they navigate two worlds.In the valley today, there is a growing network of services for gay, lesbian and transgender people, drawing Mexicans and Americans alike.Rosa Diaz, 58, founded the Imperial Valley L.G.B.T. Resource Center four years ago, shortly after she came out as a lesbian and was shunned by her church community. The center, the first and only one of its kind in the region, has become a gathering spot for members of the L.G.B.T. community from both sides of the border. It is a place that offers support and community, as well as practical help with such services as therapy, legal advice, H.I.V. counseling and consultations with endocrinologists, who administer hormone therapy for people who are transitioning gender. It also provides a Spanish-language support group.Ms. Diaz remembers one transgender woman from Mexico bringing her mother in so Ms. Diaz could help explain what “transgender” meant.ImageMs. Taylor at the Imperial Valley L.G.B.T. Center in El Centro, Calif.ImageA support group at the center.The center has been a lifeline for people like Sonia Coronado, 65, who for years led a largely traditional life on both sides of the border before joining the small transgender community.Born and raised in Mexico, Ms. Coronado went to work at a slaughterhouse in 1972 in the California town of Brawley, while continuing to live in Mexicali. After more than a decade, she and her wife relocated to a small farm community in the United States. They raised six children together.“I tried to live like a man,” she said. “I lived with the responsibilities of a man, working and supporting my family. I did the best I could. I felt so much confusion.”Ms. Coronado came out as transgender to her children and siblings three years ago, following her wife’s death after 40 years of marriage. The only person who knew about her gender identity had been her wife, who accepted it and provided immense emotional support; when she passed, Ms. Coronado felt very alone, especially because she does not speak English, she said.Like Ms. Taylor, she must dig out men’s clothing and pretend to be “Manuel” when she goes back to visit her family in Mexico.“I still haven’t made that step to go back there dressed as a woman,” Ms. Coronado said. “I’m afraid. I’m afraid about how people are over there. “The laws in California protect you a lot more,” she said. Still, there are a few gay- and lesbian-friendly clubs in Mexicali where groups of transgender women sometimes gather for drinks and dancing. Those places do not provide a replacement for day-to-day social or professional acceptance, but they help, said Sofia Gonzalez, a life insurance agent in the Imperial Valley. A little more than two years ago, she started performing drag shows in Mexicali — where, with her family, she was still living at the time as Raul Gonzalez.ImageSofia Gonzalez made breakfast before going to work as an insurance agent. She works in Calexico, Calif., and lives in Mexicali with her partner, Bryan. ImageMs. Gonzalez preparing for a drag performance at Porky's Divine in Mexicali.“I created a persona, Sofia Kahlo, and I lived through my character, doing drag and doing shows,” said Ms. Gonzalez, 25, who now spends time on both sides of the border. “And little by little I grew stronger, like the character.”Transitioning to living openly as a woman in Mexico, she said, still means daily insults and humiliations. On stage, “You’re like a celebrity, everyone wants a picture. But as a transgender woman in everyday life, you’re seen in a completely different light. They stare at you. They talk about you.” “I still get anxiety when I have to go to a big public place or a meeting,” Ms. Gonzalez said.ImageMs. Gonzalez performs as Sofia Kahlo. “You’re like a celebrity, everyone wants a picture,"" she said. ""But as a transgender woman in everyday life, you’re seen in a completely different light.""Of course, life in the United States comes with its own challenges. Ms. Taylor pretends not to notice them: The friend who tells her child that Ms. Taylor is “pretending” when she’s wearing makeup; the man at the recycling center who says, “Bye, man,” when she leaves.On a recent afternoon, the only time Ms. Taylor betrayed any emotion was at the pharmacy, when she was asked her full legal name.A long pause followed.“Jesus Enriquez Taylor,” she said finally.“I didn’t catch that, can you repeat that?”“Jesus Enriquez Taylor.”It’s better than in Mexico, she said, where storekeepers often refuse to serve her at all.Ms. Taylor’s mother lives in subsidized housing for the elderly in Calexico, and while she has largely embraced her new gender identity (“She still thinks of it as ‘dress-up,’” Ms Taylor said), the building’s rules prevent Ms. Taylor from living there. She often stays on a friend’s couch, but she has avoided reaching out lately after a minor disagreement over her hormone replacement therapy. Another friend she typically has stayed with was out of town. With such uncertainty about where she’s staying, she is ready to be either Jess or Jesus at any time: The large backpack she carries with her everywhere contains some clothing along with piles of cosmetics — blush, brushes, lipstick — and wigs, which she keeps safe in repurposed stockings.“I always have to be two people at once,” she said. “And I always want to be ready to be myself.”She’s looking for a job on the American side of the border so she won’t have to worry about where she’s going to sleep — and won’t have to let go of the things that make her Jess. But there is little work in the valley these days, and she earns her living mostly through occasional jobs as a freelance makeup artist and by fixing iPhone screens.For now, she calls herself “a queen on a budget.”“I’ll figure it out,” she said, her voice soothing, as if she were consoling someone else.ImageMs. Taylor at her brother's home in Mexicali, where she returns when she cannot find a place to stay in the United States."
5c5a18fa3a125f5075c082bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-2019-20-season.html,"Freshman year can excite with newness, but it’s as sophomores that people tend to come into their own. Jaap van Zweden’s reign as music director of the New York Philharmonic came into clearer view on Tuesday, when the orchestra announced its 2019-20 season, its second under his baton.There will be nods to the past, as in an exploration of Mahler’s time leading the Philharmonic in the final years of his life. There will be lots of new music, too, with Mr. van Zweden giving premieres by Philip Glass, Tania León, Nico Muhly, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Nina C. Young and Ellen Reid. And there will be experiments — as when he conducts Renée Fleming in Björk songs.To mark the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which barred states from denying voting rights based on gender, the Philharmonic has commissioned new works by 19 female composers, eight of which will be performed next season. Besides celebrating what Deborah Borda, the orchestra’s president and chief executive officer, called a “tectonic shift in American culture,” the project sends a statement to the classical music field at a moment when female composers still struggle to be heard.ImageThe pianist Daniil Trifonov, the Philharmonic’s artist in residence next season, played with the orchestra in September.CreditMichelle V. Agins/The New York TimesThe pianist Daniil Trifonov will be the orchestra’s artist in residence. Visiting conductors will include Susanna Malkki, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Gustavo Dudamel, Simone Young, Franz Welser-Möst and Valery Gergiev. And the Philharmonic’s popular film series will offer screenings of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Psycho,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Singin’ in the Rain” and “Mary Poppins,” with the orchestra playing the scores live.With so much on tap, what do our critics and writers want to hear?A Philip Glass premiere, and Kelli O’Hara (Sept. 18-21)With a little sleight of hand, Mr. van Zweden has moved the requisite start-of-season gala into early October; it’s a Beethoven program with the superstar pianist Lang Lang. But for his first subscription concerts he has chosen a somewhat bolder program: a new work by Mr. Glass; Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915,” with Broadway’s own Kelli O’Hara; and selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI‘Erwartung’ and ‘Bluebeard’s Castle’ (Sept. 26-28)Splashily staged opera productions were among Alan Gilbert’s boldest innovations during his time at the Philharmonic’s helm. Mindful, perhaps, of their success, Mr. van Zweden will lead a staged double bill of two darkly brilliant early-20th-century works, directed by the Swedish stage designer Bengt Gomer using video, lighting and shadow actors. The formidable soprano Nina Stemme takes on Judith in “Bluebeard’s Castle” alongside the baritone Johannes Martin Kränzle; Katarina Karneus sings “Erwartung.” CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIMImageUnsuk Chin, whose sheng concerto “Su” will be performed by the Philharmonic in October.CreditJulie Glassberg for The New York TimesUnsuk Chin’s sheng concerto (Oct. 18-22)The first time I heard “Su” — Unsuk Chin’s 2009 concerto for sheng, a Chinese mouth organ — I nearly jumped out of my chair. I was using iPhone earbuds, but Ms. Chin’s imaginative exploration of timbre still packed a memorable punch. I’ve loved the work since that first encounter; it was my pick for our “5 Minutes That Will Make You Love Classical Music” feature last year. I’ll now have my first chance to hear it live, led by Ms. Malkki, with Wu Wei as soloist. SETH COLTER WALLSSalonen conducts Salonen (Nov. 6-12)This fascinating program offers a hint of what might have been had Mr. Salonen, who is heading to the San Francisco Symphony, become the Philharmonic’s music director instead. Between rare performances of Schoenberg’s glittering orchestral transcriptions of two works by Bach, Mr. Salonen conducts a pair of his own scores: “Castor” (in its New York premiere) and “Pollux.” The program ends with Hindemith’s great “Mathis der Maler” Symphony. ANTHONY TOMMASINITrifonov plays Scriabin’s concerto (Nov. 27-Dec. 3)Mr. Trifonov has justly rocketed to New York omnipresence, and has become a fixture at the Philharmonic, including a memorable traversal of Rachmaninoff’s concertos in 2015. This year he’ll play a relative rarity: Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, a Romantic but unassuming work that will benefit from Mr. Trifonov’s subtle delicacy. (Mr. van Zweden conducts.) His residency with the orchestra will also include a Mozart classic (the Piano Concerto No. 25); a solo recital of Bach and arrangements of Bach; and the New York premiere of his Piano Quintet.

He returns for a mini-residency next season.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York TimesGustavo Dudamel’s mini-residency (Jan. 15-25)It’s not often that the Philharmonic devotes five performances to a single program. But it is handing over significant real estate to a star: Mr. Dudamel, who will lead Ives’s “The Unanswered Question,” Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony and a premiere by Esteban Benzecry. Two days after that run ends, Mr. Dudamel will be back for a program of Schubert’s Fourth Symphony and Mahler’s “Das Lied von der Erde.” JOSHUA BARONEAll-Commonwealth program (Jan. 30-31)Play Elgar and I’ll be there, but this whole program has a welcome, unforced focus to it, compared to much else in the Philharmonic’s sprawling season. Call it a Commonwealth affair, with Elgar’s “Enigma Variations” and the “Four Sea Interludes” from Britten’s “Peter Grimes” framing the American premiere of the Australian composer Brett Dean’s Cello Concerto. Alban Gerhardt is the soloist; the conductor, Simone Young, was born and started her career in Sydney. DAVID ALLEN‘Sound On’ with Joan La Barbara (Feb. 3)Joan La Barbara is the kind of gifted, veteran New York composer the Philharmonic has often declined to notice. She’s experimentally minded, certainly, but her works contain plenty of more traditional operatic melody, too. All of which makes a commission from her — set to appear as part of the contemporary chamber music series “Sound On” alongside new works by Nicole Lizée and Paola Prestini — a potential highlight of the season. SETH COLTER WALLSImageFranz Welser-Möst last year. He has been the music director of the Cleveland Orchestra since 2002, two years after he last conducted the New York Philharmonic.CreditDustin Franz for The New York TimesFranz Welser-Möst returns (Feb. 27-29)Mr. Welser-Möst has not been on the Philharmonic’s podium since 2000, two years before he took charge of the Cleveland Orchestra. New York is on its third new music director since then, but he’s still going strong in Ohio, and returns with the kind of sophisticated, new-old program Cleveland audiences will recognize: Jörg Widmann’s suite of music from his 2012 opera “Babylon” — the Philharmonic’s answer to Carnegie Hall’s focus on Mr. Widmann next season — and Strauss’s “Symphonia Domestica.” ZACHARY WOOLFEMahler’s ‘Resurrection’ Symphony (April 23-25)It’s a work that should play to Mr. van Zweden’s strengths: Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 (“Resurrection”), a monumental exploration of mortality with moments of ferocity, tenderness, and, hopefully, transcendence. The lineup, featuring the soprano Joélle Harvey and the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, is promising. And it will be nice to get to hear the immense work for its own sake rather than for a grand occasion: an orchestra’s return from a strike or the commemoration of a disaster. MICHAEL COOPERJohn Adams conducts Olga Neuwirth (May 28-June 2)The Berlin installment of “Hotspots” — a short festival exploring musical creation in that city, Reykjavik and New York — is exciting for including the first time the Philharmonic will play the orchestral music of Olga Neuwirth. (She’s Austrian, but, then again, the Reykjavik program features a new work by Nico Muhly, a New Yorker.) Conducting Ms. Neuwirth’s premiere will be John Adams, on a program with his “City Noir” and a suite from Prokofiev’s “The Love for Three Oranges.” JOSHUA BARONE‘Harmonium’! (June 11-13)More Adams rounds out the season at David Geffen Hall: his luminous choral symphony “Harmonium,” with texts by Donne and Dickinson. The Philharmonic has done it just once before, and it’s unmissable. It concludes a program that also features Ms. Snider’s premiere and Shostakovich’s sprightly Concerto for Piano (Yuja Wang, in some luxury casting), Trumpet (the orchestra’s principal, Christopher Martin) and Strings.

5c776b6c49f0eacbf105a911,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/media/brexit-media-daily-mail.html,"LONDON — Just past the entrance to the airy headquarters of The Daily Mail, Britain’s pugnacious and politically powerful publication, stands a sculpture of three small spheres with wings. The title is hidden away on a small plaque: “Bullets of Information.”Quite.Few papers in the run-up to the Brexit referendum weaponized the tabloid tools of rumor, innuendo and invective like The Mail, whose lurid, factually murky warnings of immigrant violence and European Union evils helped tip the Leave campaign over the finish line. The paper’s pro-Brexit agitating is often Exhibit A in liberal Londoners’ worries over the effect of “fake news” on the outcome of that 2016 vote.So it was a little strange this month to find The Mail praising Prime Minister Theresa May’s “tireless struggle to secure an orderly departure” from Europe, even as hard-line Brexiteers objected to her compromise approach. Or to read an editorial warning that exiting the E.U. without a negotiated plan — a so-called hard Brexit — could prove “catastrophic.”In October, the paper labeled some pro-Brexit members of Parliament “saboteurs” for their refusal to consider Mrs. May’s compromise — possibly confusing Mail readers, who a mere 18 months earlier received a front page declaring the anti-Brexit forces “saboteurs.”The shift, head-spinning by London tabloid standards, came courtesy of The Mail’s new editor, Geordie Greig, who succeeded Paul Dacre last summer. Mr. Dacre, in the job for 26 years, was a snarling Fleet Street character deeply attuned to the grievances and resentments of ‘Middle England,” the working-man-at-the-pub viewpoint that The Mail has long purported to represent.ImageGeordie Greig, who took over The Daily Mail last summer, with his wife, Kathryn, in 2016.CreditDavid M. Benett/Getty ImagesMr. Greig is no Middle Englander. An Eton and Oxford graduate from a family that runs in royal circles — his grandfather was, for a time, a close confidant of King George VI — he edited the society magazine Tatler for nearly a decade. Inheriting Mr. Dacre’s wood-toned office, he raised the low ceiling and installed artworks by old friends like David Hockney and Lucian Freud. (The Hockney consists of iPhones, embedded in a mirror, that display the artist’s latest digital doodles.)Mr. Greig had opposed Brexit from the start. At The Mail on Sunday, a corporate cousin of The Daily Mail that he began editing in 2012, he published editorials that urged readers to stick with the E.U. When he accepted Mr. Dacre’s role, some London friends were taken aback. Can a man-about-town journalist, friends with the likes of the author V. S. Naipaul and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, keep his reputation at the center of Brexit tabloid muck?With barely a month to go before the March 29 Brexit deadline, British journalists and politicians — not to mention the general public — are still struggling to understand what exactly could transpire when, or if, the break from Europe occurs.The uncertainty has trickled down to the tabloids, which remain potent players in the Brexit debate and unabashed in using their pages to further an editorial view — more akin to cable news in the United States, where pundits hash out talking points and the political class pays heed.Some papers have shown introspection, with the editor of the pro-Brexit Daily Express admitting to a parliamentary committee that his paper’s coverage had left him “very uncomfortable” and “created an Islamophobic sentiment.” Others are unchanged: On Wednesday, after the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was prepared to support a second referendum, the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun blasted out the headline “BETRAYAL.”What Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.The Mail’s enduring influence here makes its evolution all the more striking. “What’s happened to The Daily Mail under Geordie could have long-lasting, even historic consequences,” said David Yelland, a former editor of The Sun. “Here is the beloved daily newspaper of Middle England, the prime hard Brexit cheerleader suddenly arguing for a common-sense compromise.”Mr. Greig is reluctant to speak about his editorship, and he declined to comment for this article. But the attitude that generated notorious Mail headlines like “Enemies of the People” — a Dacre-era front page denouncing three obscure British judges, complete with names and head shots — has started to fade.Whether Mr. Greig’s changes are a betrayal or a betterment — or make good business sense — is a matter of lively debate. With about 1.2 million daily print subscribers, The Mail remains a predominant force in British culture and the halls of Westminster. (The Mail’s website is also among the most popular news sites in the world, though British politics make up a fraction of its celebrity-heavy content.)Mr. Greig has won praise from Remainers like Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor, who wrote in a recent column that The Mail “has stopped behaving like a punch-drunk old bruiser lurching around in search of a brawl.”“Instead,” Mr. Rusbridger added, “it feels like it might be ready to be part of a broader, calmer conversation about the future.”ImageA Brexit demonstration in London on Tuesday. “What’s happened to The Daily Mail under Geordie could have long-lasting, even historic consequences,” said David Yelland, a former editor of The Sun.CreditAlexander Coggin for The New York TimesBrexit partisans, though, say The Mail has turned its back on readers.“Not a softening — a reversal,” Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News impresario, who has championed right-wing movements across Europe, said when asked about the changes at the paper.Mr. Greig’s allies, mindful that Mr. Dacre still lurks at The Mail as an executive, take pains to say his changes are merely in tone — that The Mail still supports Brexit, only a more pragmatic, let’s-think-this-through kind of Brexit.And Mr. Dacre — whose fondness for a certain four-letter word for a female body part led colleagues to refer to his meetings as “the vagina monologues” — has not gone quietly. In a column ahead of his departure, he wrote: “Support for Brexit is in the DNA of both The Daily Mail and, more pertinently, its readers. Any move to reverse this would be editorial and commercial suicide.”The Mail is still a scold, particularly about the foibles of celebrities and royals, and its retrograde views on sex and romance are mostly unchanged. A Valentine’s Day guide this year urged lonely women to avoid turning off male suitors by shedding “gloomy” titles from bookshelves and ridding their homes of cactuses, which were deemed “unwelcoming.”Natalie Fenton, chairwoman of the Media Reform Coalition, a British good-journalism group, acknowledged that The Mail “is not your Nigel Farage ‘Brexit or Die’ anymore.” (Mr. Farage, a former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, was an early Brexit backer.)ImageThe old Daily Mail: Under its previous editor, Paul Dacre, the tabloid drew criticism for its strident tone on Brexit.CreditThe Daily MailBut Ms. Fenton, a professor at the University of London who studies Britain’s media market, said in an interview that the broader London tabloid scene was not that different, despite concerns over misinformation after Brexit.“You can still pick up a paper any day of the week and get an anti-immigration story,” she said.Like others here, Ms. Fenton said her biggest concern was that the Brexit coverage might not help Britons grasp how it would affect their lives.“There is very little public understanding, and the media has got to take responsibility for that,” she said. “The majority of reporting is conflictual still” — who’s up and who’s down in Parliament, for instance. “It’s not about the real consequences.”The Mail has the second-highest circulation of any British paper, trailing only the down-market Sun and far outpacing liberal favorites like The Guardian, whose editorial page is sharply against Brexit.One sign of the paper’s shift came in mid-February, when a top adviser to Mrs. May was overheard in Brussels suggesting that the prime minister could extend the Brexit deadline. The Daily Express — which has the slogan “We’re Backing Britain” on its front page — ran the story on its front page, declaring, “Secret Brexit Plot Exposed in Hotel Bar.”ImageA Brexit protester on Tuesday. The head of a media watchdog group said she worried that tabloid coverage wasn’t helping Britons grasp how Brexit would affect their lives.CreditAlexander Coggin for The New York TimesThe same day’s Mail placed the news on Page 10, with the relatively subdued headline “May’s Brexit Chief in Bar Blunder.” On the cover, instead, was a celebratory piece about the success of the paper’s anti-litter campaign, the Great British Spring Clean.As the three-year anniversary of the Brexit vote looms, with no clear resolution in sight, it’s also possible that average British readers simply want to think about something else.Over tea in the dining hall at Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building, Ian Dunt, the editor of Politics.co.uk, lamented that the marathon machinations of Brexit had left readers numb. Compared with President Trump’s tenure, Brexit “is much more boring,” he said, dryly.And given falling circulation numbers and the mass digital migration of news, Mr. Dunt questioned if the revised tone at The Mail, or any other paper, would do much to change minds.He may have a point. Around the corner from The Mail’s headquarters on Kensington High Street, a newsstand vendor, a man in late middle age, was asked if he had noticed anything different about the paper’s Brexit coverage.“Oh, I wouldn’t know,” he replied, with an apologetic smile. “I just do the crossword.”"
5c89793549f0eacbf105ceaa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/elizabeth-warren-tech-companies.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation — besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters — was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways.The first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other — sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace — but not both.“You can be an umpire or you can own teams,” she said. “But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game.”Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials.But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.Ms. Warren’s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I’d offer a few edits.Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren’s plan — and it’s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules — is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.Lawmakers don’t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That’s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.Instead, Ms. Warren’s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces — a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google — and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google’s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn’t giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies — each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own — gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse.For example, let’s imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company’s streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix’s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon’s streaming-video team should copy.To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon’s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address.An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.Get rid of the “app tax.” Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the “Apple tax”: a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google’s mobile app store charges similar fees.)These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms’ strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple’s App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.Don’t get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren’s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook’s ability to “shut down a debate” over its power.The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook’s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be “Facebook’s official quiz game” or whatever.But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.“She’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,” Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter.One problem with the debate over the tech companies’ power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook’s shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz’s unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for “neutral platforms.”The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies’ power, while leaving their fortresses intact."

Sign up to get it by email.___Earlier this week, a colleague, David D. Kirkpatrick, was detained by the Egyptian authorities for several hours then forced onto a flight back to London.His crime was simply flying to Cairo — and doing journalism that looked critically at Egypt’s leaders, both for The New York Times and in a recent book, “Into the Hands of the Soldiers.”As far as threats to the press go, it was not as bad as it could be. Three journalists have already been killed this year just for doing their jobs, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and 54 were killed in 2018, including Jamal Khashoggi.David’s experience, though, points to a related and more pervasive issue: the ways governments threaten, intimidate and undermine journalists and factual reporting.Visas are an especially familiar weapon. Authoritarian countries like China, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba often make it difficult for foreign reporters to get journalism visas and the right to report.Other countries, like Papua New Guinea, are more subtle about it. They tend to ignore requests for press visas, forcing some of us to go anyway on a different kind of visa, which then gives the authorities the ability to kick us out.When I was in Manus, an island there, reporting on the detention center there in late 2017, for example, I was visited repeatedly by the authorities, then detained for more than an hour at the airport in Port Moresby as they made clear that it was time for me to go.Many of The Times’s foreign correspondents have experienced this sort of thing (or worse) over the years, in various places.Being a foreigner and a New York Times reporter tends to help — it’s always local journalists who face greater danger, as I saw in Mexico and Iraq — and the threats we face did not used to be something many journalists or media companies talked about very often.But what’s interesting is that for The Times at least, that’s changing.Our new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, has been especially vocal as of late, advocating on behalf of journalism and journalists, and trying to persuade President Trump to tone down his rhetoric, such as his references to journalists as the “enemy of the people.”This week that dispute flared up yet again.A.G.’s main point speaks to something that is sometimes easy to overlook; that however flawed journalists and our journalism may be, demonizing journalists — especially as a group — hurts democracy, and has the potential to be deadly.Just this week, the authorities in Maryland said a Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist who had been arrested was plotting to kill several prominent American journalists, among others.“The phrase ‘enemy of the people’ is not just false, it’s dangerous,” A.G. wrote in a statement this week responding to President Trump’s latest broadside (perhaps inspired by this story from us with new details about his efforts to undermine the special counsel investigation). “It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants.”What you’re seeing now, A.G. argues (along with many political scientists), is the spread of that particular virus.When the only defenders of journalism are journalists — when elected officials in a democracy behave as if reporters are combatants — leaders with tyrannical instincts become emboldened.You see it not just in Egypt, but also in Turkey, Hungary, China and the Philippines, where the authorities recently arrested Maria Ressa, a co-founder of an online news start-up critical of President Rodrigo Duterte.Australia is also not immune to politically stoked media hatred. Many Australians hear echoes of Trump’s statements in the outbursts of Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister. But you can also hear it once in a while from Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has a tendency to dismiss tough questions from reporters with accusations of bias, while former prime ministers — Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull — have turned their frustration with the Murdoch-media into extended rants.This does not seem to be something that’s likely to go away. Making the media an enemy is an easy way to delegitimize coverage that aims for accountability, and because the journalism business is struggling and increasingly distrusted, journalists are easy to dismiss as a group.The only antidote that I can see is you — readers and supporters of independent credible journalism.So the next time you see hear someone criticize “the media,” do me a favor: Ask them to be more specific and remind them that we’re not a monolith.Yes, there are journalists who make mistakes, yes there are forces of partisanship and commercialism that taint what you get from some outlets — but there is also a lot of strong work being done to examine and scrutinize power, and provide people with the information they need to make good decisions.There is a mission to guide us — we seek the truth and help people understand the world. And there is courage and determination in our ranks.That’s what David represents. That’s what Egypt’s leaders fear.Now for a few examples from the past week.

5c538d533a125f5075c076db,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/mar-a-lago-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — After two months spent scorching the earth in Washington and complaining about being cooped up in the White House, President Trump is planning to return this weekend to the one place where he knows he will receive a hero’s welcome for his troubles: Mar-a-Lago, his gilded club by the sea in Palm Beach.“You would have to be insensitive not to be touched by how he has stayed there working,” said Toni Holt Kramer, the founder of Trumpettes USA, a booster group that is planning to welcome him. “I think people will have tears in their eyes because they’re so grateful that he’s come back to his home away from home.”Mr. Trump made a point of staying in Washington over the Christmas holidays — waiting, he said, for Democrats to negotiate with him on funding for a border wall — so it will be the president’s first visit to Mar-a-Lago since Thanksgiving.It will not be a complete escape — he still has no deal on the wall and a State of the Union address to give on Tuesday. But after his arrival on Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump is expected to do many of the things he always does when he is at Mar-a-Lago: dining at the owner’s table on the patio; spending the afternoon at Trump International Golf Club, about a 15-minute motorcade drive away; and never venturing anywhere in Palm Beach outside his own two properties.The first lady, Melania Trump, will travel there with him this weekend, her spokeswoman said, though Mrs. Trump tends to keep a low profile while at the resort.In the Mar-a-Lago cocoon, the president is in his most comfortable mode, friends and allies say: playing the jocular host in front of an adoring crowd.On Saturday, P.J. Schrantz, who founded Veleve, a charity that provides support for veterans, is betting on Mr. Trump to make an appearance at a $600-a-plate fund-raiser his organization is hosting in one of the club’s ballrooms. And plans for Mr. Trump’s annual Super Bowl viewing party at his golf club on Sunday evening, complete with a steak and lobster buffet, are still on.“I chose to have it there because I’ve attended galas there,” Mr. Schrantz said of his event, which will feature a George Michael tribute artist donating his time, as well as honor the astronaut Buzz Aldrin. “The members are such giving people that we could raise a couple of million dollars in an evening.”Some Mar-a-Lago members say they are already wistful about the blissful weeks without tangled traffic and increased security — a seven-minute drive from home to the club takes at least 30 minutes when Mr. Trump is in town, one said — but many will brave the roads for the chance to participate in a presidential selfie or a similar show of support.Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and is the author of “Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump’s Presidential Palace,” said in an interview that even if people had an issue with the president’s policymaking, the meatloaf recipe or anything in between, they tended to keep it to themselves.“People have been trained to have like a Pavlovian reaction or something,” Mr. Leamer said. “You’re supposed to say things are great. When he asks you, ‘How are things?’ you’re not supposed to complain.”Just as the Trump International Hotel in Washington has become a safe space for the president and his supporters, Mar-a-Lago is a 20-acre oasis for those who adore all things Trump, from his zero-tolerance immigration policies to the menu items named after his children.The focus on Mr. Trump has grown to the point where some Democratic members, who have loved the club’s amenities for decades, have recently rescinded their memberships because they do not feel comfortable there anymore.ImageSupporters lined up in Palm Beach to greet Mr. Trump in November. Mar-a-Lago has become an oasis for those who adore all things Trump.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York Times“There’s a political angle to being a member now,” said Cynthia Friedman, a Democratic fund-raiser who joined the club 24 years ago and recalls playing tennis on Saturdays with Marla Maples, Mr. Trump’s second wife. “There are a lot of people who I don’t recognize. They’re not the people I used to play tennis with. Things change, and it’s time to move on.”In December, instead of sending her $1,600 in monthly dues, she joined the Beach Club, a rival members-only club, on the other side of town.But Ms. Friedman is still in the minority. Many Mar-a-Lago members book reservations weeks in advance to be in the same room with the president. And Trumpworld celebrities, like Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director; the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.; and Antonio Sabato Jr., the Trump-loving model-turned-politician, have been spotted at social events and fund-raisers in Palm Beach, serving as something of a warm-up act to the main event.Karyn Turk, a business owner and the 2016 winner of the Mrs. Florida beauty pageant, said if the walls looked like they were caving in on the president in Washington, there were only blue skies in Palm Beach.“It’s a lot of hype,” she said of the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III. “I feel like in a lot of ways, it’s still just a witch hunt.”If the “Winter White House” is a boon for the members of Mr. Trump’s exclusive club, and a respite not only for the president but also for the staff members who relocate with him, the annual decampment still raises ethical concerns.The White House has refused to release a list of those who visit the president there. And elsewhere in the Trump Organization orbit, the company said it would introduce new procedures to screen for undocumented immigrants after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump’s flagship New Jersey golf club employed people who had entered the country illegally.And ProPublica reported last summer that three Mar-a-Lago members had amassed an unusual amount of influence in the Department of Veterans Affairs, meddling in agency initiatives and participating in the review of a contract worth some $10 billion.“It certainly seems unprecedented,” said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the ethics watchdog CREW, “and highly troubling for people to be given significant authority over government matters seemingly primarily on the basis of being paying customers of the president.”The White House has taken at least one informal step to block people who have access to the president’s properties from asking for anything that seems to go too far. Aides have long been on the alert to intercept any notes or policy proposals from overeager supporters — including one from a guest who once helpfully tried to show the president an executive order he had drafted. Mr. Trump has at times directed his aides to give those people ample listening time even if he cannot, according to someone familiar with the process and his thinking.Security around the president may have tightened since 2017, when Mr. Trump sat on the open patio, in front of hundreds of eyeballs and iPhones pointed in his direction, discussing a response to North Korea’s missile test with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. But in many ways, Mr. Trump himself has not changed from the involved club owner he has always been.He has always kept close watch over who comes and goes, and pays close attention to those in the latter category.Jeff Greene, the Palm Beach billionaire who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor of Florida, joined the club when he moved to Palm Beach in 2010. But he quit because, he said, “I have my own tennis court. I never loved going there.”Mr. Trump, he said, took his resignation personally. Sitting next to him at a charity event at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Greene recalled being confronted. “He went right at me, saying, ‘I can’t believe you quit the club.’ He’s figuring someone with plenty of money, why would they care about paying dues for a club?”"
5c50242b3a125f5075c06d78,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/books/review/roger-mcnamee-zucked.html,"ZUCKED Waking Up to the Facebook CatastropheBy Roger McNameeThe dystopia George Orwell conjured up in “1984” wasn’t a prediction. It was, instead, a reflection. Newspeak, the Ministry of Truth, the Inner Party, the Outer Party — that novel sampled and remixed a reality that Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism had already made apparent. Scary stuff, certainly, but maybe the more frightening dystopia is the one no one warned you about, the one you wake up one morning to realize you’re living inside.Roger McNamee, an esteemed venture capitalist, would appear to agree. “A dystopian technology future overran our lives before we were ready,” he writes in “Zucked.” Think that sounds like overstatement? Let’s examine the evidence. At its peak the planet’s fourth most valuable company, and arguably its most influential, is controlled almost entirely by a young man with the charisma of a geometry T.A. The totality of this man’s professional life has been running this company, which calls itself “a platform.” Company, platform — whatever it is, it provides a curious service wherein billions of people fill it with content: baby photos, birthday wishes, concert promotions, psychotic premonitions of Jewish lizard-men. No one is paid by the company for this labor; on the contrary, users are rewarded by being tracked across the web, even when logged out, and consequently strip-mined by a complicated artificial intelligence trained to sort surveilled information into approximately 29,000 predictive data points, which are then made available to advertisers and other third parties, who now know everything that can be known about a person without trepanning her skull. Amazingly, none of this is secret, despite the company’s best efforts to keep it so. Somehow, people still use and love this platform.Hostile foreign intelligence services also love this platform, if only because its users have proved shockingly vulnerable to social manipulation — a dark art the company itself has admitted to dabbling in. In 2014, the company set out to learn whether it could make its users sad and angry on purpose. It learned it could. When this astonishing breach of user trust became public, the company claimed it wasn’t a big deal, that many companies did similar things. It was, and they don’t.A tech company founded on creating human connection is now ripping American society apart and compromising our civic foundation, though not because it has overtly wicked intent. As McNamee elucidates, our “democracy has been undermined because of design choices.” Choices including the platform’s pleasurable, frictionless interface, which encourages users to stay and return. It’s no stretch to posit that because human neurotransmitters respond to the platform’s iconic use of a certain shade of blue, and spark with dopamine upon receiving a “like” or “tag” notification, desperate children are now living in cages and a raving madman occupies the Oval Office. Not even Orwell, after a feast of psilocybin, could have predicted this dystopia. This one’s all ours.For any aliens or recently arrived time travelers reading this, the company in question is Facebook, and its young leader Mark Zuckerberg, with whom McNamee has such a long and familiar relationship so as to refer to him throughout by his diminutive, Zuck. In 2006, McNamee writes, he counseled the 22-year-old C.E.O. against selling Facebook to Yahoo for a billion dollars. “I don’t want to disappoint everyone,” Zuckerberg said. McNamee urged him to look beyond that and “keep Facebook independent.” Zuck heeded McNamee’s advice, and here we are.ImageMcNamee also profited from this mentorship. Along with his venture capital firm, Elevation Partners, the author made a fortune off an early investment in Zuckerberg’s company, a subject about which he is now suitably circumspect, given his belief that Facebook, along with Google and other tech giants, today represents “the greatest threat to the global order in my lifetime.” A self-identified “capitalist,” McNamee currently advocates breaking up Facebook’s data monopoly by force, and heavily regulating its appalling business practices. “Zucked” is thus a candid and highly entertaining explanation of how and why a man who spent decades picking tech winners and cheering his industry on has been carried to the shore of social activism.McNamee saves his most conspicuous outrage for Facebook’s amoral leadership at the hands of not just Zuckerberg but also his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, whom McNamee recommended Zuck hire before she could take a job at The Washington Post. McNamee describes their grip on the company as “the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.” Their power dyad is possible only because Facebook’s “core platform,” as McNamee puts it, is relatively simple: It “consists of a product and a monetization scheme.” Non-tech companies with comparable global reach (Coca-Cola, Exxon) must deal with complex real-world infrastructure issues as well as the needs of a highly diverse work force. Large corporations also typically create interrelated eddies of economic activity, whereas Facebook’s business model is founded upon sucking the economic activity out of otherwise productive workers. Most troubling of all, a company whose product is used by one-third of the planet has only 30,000 employees. In every imaginable sense, Facebook is a Borg-like drain on the world’s economy. It doesn’t make you better and likely makes you worse. Unlike Exxon, it can’t even get you to Albuquerque.The story of Facebook has been told many times before, but McNamee does a superb job of contextualizing its rise within the proper technological history. Without the advents of the iPhone, cloud data storage and the industry’s “lean start-up” model, Facebook may well have wandered down the bleak path of the short-lived early-2000s social media entities Myspace and Friendster. McNamee also takes care to remind the reader of the telltale heart (or lack thereof) beating beneath the floorboards of Facebook headquarters: Its first iteration, Facemash, invited Harvard students to compare photos of female classmates — photos Zuckerberg stole from online student housing directories — for the high cause of determining who was hotter. Yes, the world’s fourth most valuable company can trace its origins to the frustrated misogyny of an ur-incel. The moral vacuousness Zuckerberg displayed as a young adult should have told us something about how he and many other young “disrupters” intended to operate. As McNamee writes, “You can imagine how attractive a philosophy that absolves practitioners of responsibility for the impact of their actions on others would be to entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley.”The most stirring parts of the book are those in which McNamee makes the angry but measured argument that “social media has enabled personal views that had previously been kept in check by social pressure.” The kook we will always have with us, to paraphrase Jesus, but the kooks of yore had to work to maintain their kookery and locate fellow kooks. They had to pick up their kook phone, subscribe to the kook newsletter, drive to the kook convention. Nowadays, all the kook has to do is log in to Facebook, where his feed will be enlivened by the chatter of fellow — and likely more extreme — kooks, toward which Facebook’s algorithms helpfully steer him. Zuckerberg et al. probably didn’t set out to transform American neo-Nazism into this generation’s punk rock, but the platforms they created have generated “a feedback loop that reinforces and amplifies ideas with a speed and at a scale that are unprecedented.”McNamee’s book is not merely the cri de coeur of a forsworn tech optimist zinged by moral conscience. It’s also a robust and helpful itemization of the ways Facebook could be brought to heel. McNamee clearly believes the company can be made into something more benign, and perhaps even socially beneficial. That may or may not be true, but the damage it has already done is not precisely containable. Considering the high likelihood that Russian activity on Facebook may have tipped the 2016 election to Donald Trump, the damage is already of generational measure.But here’s the bizarre quirk of the Facebook dystopia, whose sheer perversity would have likely pleased Orwell: It’s all Big and no Brother. Our time and lives are the company’s only currency. Without our continued attention, Facebook quite literally has nothing, and its empire could be brought down with a feather. Now, blow."
5c2f66e63a125f5075c02d74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/amazon-problems.html,"Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi, I’m David Streitfeld, reporting from a very quiet week in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalists were at their vacation homes or exotic resorts, dreaming of riches to come. Entrepreneurs also must have taken time off, because I made it to San Jose in less than two hours, a personal record. There wasn’t even a new data privacy scandal to occupy the pundits.Amazon, however, never lets up. Chances are, something under your family Christmas tree or at your Hanukkah or Kwanzaa celebration was from the retailer. Perhaps everything was. Amazon’s 210th and final press release of the year summarized the company’s holiday season: best ever. If history is any guide, more than half those sales were made by third parties — shops big and small that are in essence renting a stall in the Amazon bazaar.With millions of marketplace sellers battling for a piece of the lucrative Amazon action, competition is fierce. Exactly how tough I didn’t realize until I read a piece called “Prime and Punishment: Dirty Dealing in the $175 Billion Amazon Marketplace,” by Josh Dzieza on the tech site the Verge. Almost as an aside, the article mentions that some unscrupulous sellers were taking an established competitor’s product, setting it on fire and then posting photos saying it exploded. Amazon would go nuts and pull the product as a safety hazard, leaving a clear field for the shady new arrival.Another common move, the article says, is to get a competitor’s product reclassified as a sex toy, suppressing it from ordinary search results. This happened to a seller of childproof locks and outlet covers, whose sales dwindled to zero because absolutely no one was searching for “sexual childproof door lock.”At Amazon, the customer reigns supreme, which means sellers who are accused of doing something wrong need to confess to something, anything, even if they are the victim of another seller’s sabotage. It’s so difficult to mount a successful appeal that many merchants hire professional advisers to get them out of Amazon jail.(I asked Amazon how often sellers took the arson route. In a statement, the retailer replied, “There are bad actors who attempt to undermine our store, but they do not reflect the flourishing community of honest entrepreneurs that make up the vast majority of our seller community.”)Amazon also turns up in a new story in Wired, which asks: Whatever happened to the Future Book? That is the writer Craig Mod’s term for the immersive, interactive, highly connected thrill ride that would finally kill off the traditional boring physical book by, oh, 2015.It didn’t happen. “My Kindle Oasis — one of the most svelte, elegant and expensive digital book containers you can buy in 2018 — is about as interactive as a potato,” Mr. Mod writes. One possible reason: Amazon had little competition for the Kindle, so innovation in e-readers ground to a halt.Both the Wired and the Verge stories might seem to be about how Amazon is overextended, can’t be all things to all people and needs to do what it already does better rather than keep expanding into new fields. But they’re really about how Amazon wins even when it loses.Mr. Mod’s point is that while Kindles never killed physical books, there has nevertheless been an explosion of activity around the book. For instance, it is much simpler and much cheaper to publish yourself than it was 20 years ago. There has also been an explosion in recorded books that will only grow as smart speakers in the home become ubiquitous.ImageAmazon’s Kindle hasn’t killed physical books, and a writer in Wired explored why.CreditBrendan McDermid/ReutersAnd who owns the leading home speaker company, the leading recorded books company and the biggest — by far — physical and digital bookstore? You guessed it.As for the Amazon Marketplace sellers who are undermined by bad guys, Amazon has an answer: protection, for a price.“When sellers get in trouble for customer complaints or attacks from counterfeiters,” Mr. Dzieza writes, “the solution is often to more fully meld with Amazon — to enroll in its fulfillment program, to purchase Amazon’s labels to make sure product isn’t being diverted or even make their brand exclusive to Amazon, which brings special protections.”A wrinkle about the third-party sellers that the Verge doesn’t tackle is the way Amazon makes them sign what is called a most-favored-nation or M.F.N. clause, which stipulates they cannot sell on another site cheaper than they sell on Amazon. British and German regulators investigated the retailer’s use of these clauses a few years ago, with the result that Amazon dropped the practice in Europe. But they’re still in use in the United States.In May, two law professors detailed the case against the M.F.N. restrictions as harmful to consumers in a Yale Law Journal article, “Antitrust Enforcement Against Platform MFNs.” A few days before Christmas, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut picked up on the issue and wrote a four-page letter to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department saying he was “deeply concerned” that Amazon’s M.F.N. contracts could stifle market competition and artificially inflate prices.For instance, Mr. Blumenthal wrote, a competitor to Amazon might try to gain an edge by charging merchants a smaller commission. If those merchants also sell on Amazon, however, they could not pass along those savings to their customers, because of the M.F.N. clause. That would be bad for consumers while reinforcing Amazon’s dominance. Amazon declined to comment.■ It used to be that only a few cranks criticized Amazon, but that is rapidly shifting. Still, I was surprised at the take-no-prisoners tone of David Heinemeier Hansson, the programmer who writes and tweets as DHH, in an open letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, on Medium.“I think you’re currently making bad decisions that you’re going to regret. Maybe even decisions that we as a whole society will come to regret,” DHH wrote. He added that Mr. Bezos still had time to shape his legacy “into something more than the man who killed retail, extracted the greatest loot from its HQ cities, and who expanded the most monopoly holdings the fastest.”DHH wrote his piece in November, but Medium surfaced it in its daily digest just last week. What makes his criticism especially noteworthy is that Mr. Bezos is a shareholder in DHH’s software development company, Basecamp. DHH notes that he and his co-founder have not talked to Mr. Bezos for at least seven years but that “if we get another chance, this would be the most pressing topic.”■ One last new Amazon development, which might be the biggest of all: unionization. Workers at Amazon’s biggest warehouse in Spain began a two-day strike on Thursday. Warehouse employees on Staten Island are calling for unionization, following the lead of colleagues in Minnesota. Here is a good wrap-up from the Guardian. Amazon has successfully stymied unionization efforts since the company began, so this shift is momentous.■ In non-Amazon news, it appears that the answer to the eternal question of whether the world can have too many iPhones is: Quite likely.■ Thanks to Apple’s news, the stock market as I write is again plunging. But there’s a silver lining for tech companies: They are big, and getting bigger, and a recession might only help them against the competition."
5c2f2eb03a125f5075c02d06,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html,"A blockbuster jobs report and reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve chairman reminded investors Friday to relish, at least for now, the economy’s undeniable strengths.Markets reacted buoyantly, after lurching for weeks over a faltering outlook at home and signs of a global slowdown.The Labor Department report showed one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade, with employers adding 312,000 to payrolls in December. Wages, which had been lagging until recently, showed impressive gains.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chief, cheered the report, while offering assurances that policymakers would not move quickly to raise interest rates. Investors had been concerned that additional rate increases would weigh on growth. “2018, by so many measures, was a good year for the United States economy,” he said at an economic conference in Atlanta.He also sought to ease concerns about the stability of the central bank. When asked whether he would resign if President Trump asked him to, Mr. Powell simply said, “No.”Wall Street’s enthusiastic response to the jobs numbers was magnified by Mr. Powell’s comments. The S&P 500 index closed up more than 3 percent.“It’s an unequivocally phenomenal report all the way around,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “Anyone that finds something negative in this report is simply cherry picking.”Economists offered raves that could appear on a movie poster or a book jacket — “Extraordinary!” “Blowout,” “Wow!” The figures, they said, offer a resounding response to the question of whether a recession is imminent: “Never mind!” said David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide. “The fears of the economy tipping into a recession now have clearly been overstated.”Mr. Trump welcomed the stellar showing in televised remarks delivered in the White House Rose Garden. “312,000 jobs was a tremendous number and obviously having a big impact on the stock market today,” he said, adding that the pickup in wage growth was “beautiful to watch.”But the latest report comes in the context of flashing yellow lights elsewhere, which Mr. Powell acknowledged on Friday. There is an unresolved trade war with China, a nation already contending with an economic downturn that could dampen global demand. In the United States, there is a slump in the housing sector, with hints that the auto industry could be next.This week, Apple cut its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years, citing flagging iPhone sales in China. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on CNN that Apple would not be the only victim of tensions with Beijing.“There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China,” Mr. Hassett said.And on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management released a survey showing the biggest drop in manufacturing activity since 2008. Many manufacturers blamed rising costs related to tariffs. (The index reading of 54.1 still showed an economy in expansion.) Measures of consumer confidence have also weakened recently.The stock market has been in the midst of its worst decline since the financial crisis.“We’re listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending,” Mr. Powell said Friday. But investors, he said, “are way ahead of the data.”Indeed, economists insist that there is more to celebrate than to fret over. In recent months, the unemployment rate has been hovering near a 50-year nadir. (The jobless rate rose last month, to 3.9 percent, but largely because new workers barreled into the labor force, suggesting that companies are luring stragglers back.) Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, indicating confidence in their ability to find jobs.Wages, which for months only inched up, have begun to pick up more quickly. December’s year-over-year increase hit 3.2 percent, tying October for the biggest surge since 2009. The recovery has gone on for so long that it has finally begun to benefit the lowest-paid workers, who have seen the biggest pay gains.The competition for employees has become excruciating for people like Michael Haith, the chief executive of Teriyaki Madness, a fast-casual Japanese food chain. The restaurant needs to staff 50 new locations next year, which means hiring up to 1,000 workers. That’s not an easy feat in “a brutal market” for employers, Mr. Haith said.He vies for workers with big brands like Burger King. Rival businesses have sent recruiters into Teriyaki Madness stores to poach his employees with offers of higher salaries. In Colorado, where the chain is based, he’s also fending off marijuana farmers, who pay trimmers up to $17 an hour.“Good employees can pretty much go wherever they want,” Mr. Haith said. “It’s really an arms race.” His shops have increased wages by $1 or $2 an hour in the last year, just to keep up. He’s not alone. Food-service workers nationwide got particularly big pay bumps last year, according to the latest federal data.Moves like that are part of what made 2018 “a banner year for the labor market,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter. And the 99-month streak of job gains could get even longer. There are still Americans who do not have jobs or are not clocking as many hours as they would like. The share of people who have part-time positions but would prefer to work full time is higher today than it was in 2007.And a far smaller share of the American population is working today than before the recession. That decline is partly because of the aging of the baby boom generation. But even among people in their prime working years, employment is down from before the recession, and far below its peak at the height of the dot-com boom.“We are not yet at maximum employment,” Ms. Pollak said.ImageConstruction workers erecting scaffolding last month in Manhattan. Builders continued to hire last year even as the housing market slowed.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York TimesOver all, employers added more jobs in 2018 than they did in 2017, at a monthly average of 220,000. But last year was unique, because Congress passed a big corporate tax cut that essentially bathed a sizzling economy in lighter fluid.“People got used to these eye-popping job-growth numbers,” said Martha Gimbel, director of research for the job-search site Indeed. Even if hiring slows in the coming months, she said, “it doesn’t mean that anything’s wrong, it just means we are heading back to normal.”But investors have to weigh that interpretation — that the economy is peacefully drifting toward less exciting times — against the possibility that it is reeling toward calamity. It hasn’t helped their mood (or Mr. Trump’s) that the Fed decided to raise its target lending rate four times in 2018.And even Friday’s stellar jobs numbers come with caveats. Each month’s figures are revised twice, and provide snapshots of the past, not the future. December’s report does not account for workers furloughed during the government shutdown, which began after last month’s surveys were conducted.Wall Street, of course, has the potential to create the bad news it seems to be anticipating. Concern over withering retirement funds could prompt Americans to tamp down on spending. And business owners might start to pull back on investments. That unholy feedback loop can begin to chip away at economic growth.“When market sentiment has gotten this negative, investors aren’t going to take one single data point and say: ‘Oh, we were wrong! Things are just fine,’” Ms. Zentner said. She added that people might hesitate to put their full faith in the forecasts of economists. “Look how right we were leading up to the financial crisis.”"

With the partial government shutdown now in its 12th day — and with Democrats taking control of the House on Thursday — President Trump invited congressional leaders from both parties to a gathering in the Situation Room billed as a border security briefing.The meeting yielded no agreement. It only served to highlight the gulf between the president, who has dug in on his demand for Congress to fund a border wall, his signature campaign promise, and Democrats, who have refused to do so.Earlier, Mr. Trump rejected a plan that Vice President Mike Pence privately floated to Democrats last month, saying $2.5 billion for border security — rather than the $5.6 billion that the president has requested — was insufficient. He also rejected a compromise that would pair money for a wall with legislation to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

President Xi Jinping urged unification with Taiwan and demanded greater progress in Beijing’s decades-long quest to win control of the disputed island.Mr. Xi gave Taiwan two options: He could use military force if the self-ruled territory grasped for independence, or he could offer a “one country, two systems” deal, similar to the framework used in Hong Kong. But the president didn’t lay down a timetable for either path.Only 3 percent of Taiwan’s population favors immediate unification with China, according to a recent survey.

It led to a romance fueled by robust curiosity and the desire to build a legacy.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesMarriage, they say, is a negotiation, a protracted conversation built on trust, shared goals and infinite reserves of tact.It’s a concept not lost on Yelena Ambartsumian and Miroslav Grajewski, who, well before they traded vows Jan. 19 at St. Illuminator’s Armenian Apostolic Cathedral in Manhattan, had already mastered the art of the deal.Two years ago, Ms. Ambartsumian, 30, an associate in the law firm Milbank, and Mr. Grajewski, 28, an engineer and executive with Zuvic Carr and Associates, embarked on a courtship sparked by a mutual passion for contemporary art. That shared appetite led them to invest piece by piece in a jointly held collection.ImageThe bride preparing for the ceremony Jan. 19 at St. Illuminator’s Armenian Apostolic Cathedral in Manhattan.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesTheir path in the art world was halting at first. “We definitely had a fair number of moments where we thought we were nuts,” Mr. Grajewski said just days before the wedding, going on to describe a romance fueled by robust curiosity and the desire to build a legacy. Were they driven to compete with other, perhaps more seasoned young trophy hunters?Not at all, Mr. Grajewski said. Still, at Art Basel in Miami, collecting can be like a contest. ‘“People will greet you with, ‘What did you get?’” he said, that question abruptly followed by, “‘Oh here’s what we got in the few hours since we last saw you.’”By contrast, he added emphatically, “We made sure we were buying a piece because we liked it and not for any other reason.”They made their first buy, a photographic work by Willa Nasatir, after dating for only six months. “Even after such a short time, we were making harder choices than a lot of married couples,” Ms. Ambartsumian said. Their acquisitions were modest at first, becoming more ambitious with time, some priced in the tens of thousands or more for a variety of works, many by European or Near Eastern artists. Women artists represent half of their collection.ImageThe couple met in 2016 in New York at a reception for the Museum of Modern Art junior associates. “That night I went out on my own, which was unusual for me because I’m an introvert,” Ms. Ambartsumian said. “I thought this is something I really want to do. I’ll go and make new friends. Still, I didn’t expect to meet my husband there.”CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesTo some, such sums may seem staggering. Indeed Ms. Ambartsumian’s parents — her mother a psychiatrist, her father, an electrical engineer — may well have been taken aback.“We’re not oligarchs,” Ms. Ambartsumian said. The couple split the cost of each purchase, acquiring works at the rate of about one per month, each a considered decision and a valiant leap of faith. “The more we collected,” she said, “the more we came to trust each other, and the more we fell in love.”The couple met in 2016 at a reception for the Museum of Modern Art junior associates. “That night I went out on my own, which was unusual for me because I’m an introvert,” Ms. Ambartsumian said. “I thought this is something I really want to do. I’ll go and make new friends. Still, I didn’t expect to meet my husband there.”ImageThe Rev. Mesrob Lakissian placed gilded coronets on the heads of the bride and groom, an Armenian tradition anointing the couple as the rulers of their domestic kingdom.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesShe was heading toward the exit when Mr. Grajewski rushed to introduce himself. They made their way to a balcony overlooking the MoMA Sculpture Garden to begin a conversation that seemed only to deepen as the weeks wore on.“We couldn’t stop talking,” Ms. Ambartsumian said.Their first formal date was a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “We wanted to go together to a place that we had gone to so many times on our own,” she said. “Visiting something familiar seemed like a safe choice.”They continued to go to museums and attend junior associate events and art fairs. “At a certain point we realized that the only way we could keep learning was by actually getting more involved in the art world,” Mr. Grajewski said. “We felt the next step was to see what collecting was all about.”During their treks, they would compare notes, often astonished to find that on just about every occasion they were drawn to the same several pieces, their interests encompassing canvases both abstract and figurative, vividly colorful and monochromatic, and, in addition, pieces of sculpture and photography.ImageBefore they married, the determining factor in whether the couple would buy a piece of art was, the groom said, “that we would decide together what we want to wake up to and see every day.”CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesThat shared affinity may well have been bred in the bone. Growing up they routinely accompanied their parents — his Chilean and Polish born, hers Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan — on museum and gallery jaunts here and abroad. As children, Ms. Ambartsumian said, “We each saw a lot of the same art works.”Once the couple set their sights on a piece, they would return to it multiple times, at varying hours, and in shifting moods. When they settled on a purchase, Mr. Grajewski, the more extroverted of the pair, would begin negotiations. The couple, who drew from their savings, had agreed in advance to split the cost.“Each of us had veto power,” Mr. Grajewski said. At times their choices were at odds. “But from the very beginning we were opposed to any kind of passive-aggressiveness,” he said. “That didn’t mean that you couldn’t say things tactfully, only that you weren’t building up a certain resentment.”The determining factor was, he said, “that we would decide together what we want to wake up to and see every day.”Image“These are two people who are ahead of their times, behind the times, and in the moment all at once,” Hanna Matevosyan, the maid of honor, told guests at the reception.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesSome of their pieces were housed early on in Ms. Ambartsumian’s former apartment near Wall Street. They would later find their way to Milford, Conn., where the couple now resides.The works for the most part are vivid and generously scaled. Those dominating the living room include an outsize canvas by the German neo-expressionist Andre Butzer, a doll-like portrait of a woman with saucer eyes in a scarlet frock.Another, a geometric abstraction by the Austrian Bernhard Buhmann, takes up much of a corridor wall.Other more patently provocative pieces include a graphic depiction of bestiality by the Iranian-born Belgian artist Sanam Khatibi, a fantastical landscape in which a beast and a human female couple.Before Ms. Ambartsumian moved to her new home in Connecticut, her mother, Dr. Barbara Sumbatian, paid a visit. Spying the painting over the dining table, as the bride recalled, Dr. Sumbatian offered a single wry comment, asking, “How are you going to explain this to your children?”ImageA chance to write a note during the reception, which was at 11 Madison Park in New York.CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesThe groom’s mother, Marici Zuvic Grajewski, had raised an eyebrow as well. But his unorthodox choice in art did nothing to dent her faith in the match. What could go wrong, after all?“Yelena and Miroslav, they have so many things in common,” she said. Her eyes crinkling in amusement, she added, “Oh, and of course they love each other.”As guests began filing into the church, Hanna Matevosyan, Ms. Ambartsumian’s maid of honor, picked up the thread. Pinching a portion of the speech she would give at the reception, she said, “In today’s world an engineer from Connecticut and corporate lawyer in Manhattan aren’t often in the same room and usually don’t have much in common. But their fit with one another is strikingly obvious.”A short time later Ms. Ambartsumian caused necks to crane as she glided toward the altar in an ivory flower-embroidered Elizabeth Fillmore dress, its back plunging toward her waist. Its otherwise regal look was enhanced when the officiant, the Rev. Mesrob Lakissian, intoned the familiar verses from Corinthians, “Love bears all things, hopes all things…,” and placed a crown on her head.ImageThe couple plan to continue expanding the collection of some two dozen original works. “Our goal,” Ms. Ambartsumian said, “is to give our children an investment of their parents’ time, of their learning, and of their exposure to different people, places, thoughts and experiences.”CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesDuring the reception that followed at Eleven Madison Park, Ms. Ambartsumian put on the gown’s matching cape, a token of modesty she chose to discard just before the ceremony but intended to wear throughout the reception and dinner. Why the reversal? Vaguely, and somewhat mischievously, she said, “I just wanted a change.”Her gesture was in keeping with the convention-bending spirit of the pair. “These are two people who are ahead of their times, behind the times, and in the moment all at once,” Ms. Matevosyan told guests at the reception.But on this occasion, it seemed, the couple was resolutely looking forward. “Collecting was part of a journey that Yelena and I went on,” Mr. Grajewski said.“Our goal,” Ms. Ambartsumian added, “is to give our children an investment of their parents’ time, of their learning, and of their exposure to different people, places, thoughts and experiences.”They plan to continue expanding the collection of some two dozen original works. As the family grows, Mr. Grajewski said, “It will be something that’s ours.”ON THIS DAYWhen Jan. 19, 2019Where St. Illuminator’s Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, New YorkAn iPhone Courtship Within days after meeting her future husband, Ms. Ambartsumian took off with her parents for Spain. But Mr. Grajewski was never far from her mind. “The whole trip we were texting and texting,” she recalled. “I felt like a teenager.” A Style of Her Own Pushing aside the church call for modesty, the bride shed her cape before she sailed down the aisle, revealing a gown that plunged in the back.Moving Moment Forsaking the traditional “Canon in D” wedding march, Solange Merdinian, a mezzo-soprano, brought many of the guests to tears with a solo rendition of “Ave Maria.” Crowned Heads Toward the end of the ceremony, the Rev.

Here’s the latest: ImagePresident Trump in the Cabinet Room on Friday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesPerils mount for the Trump presidency.The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival “that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison,” writes our chief White House correspondent.News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.And The Washington Post reported that the president had taken extensive steps to conceal his conversations with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin over the past two years.Congress: Democrats in the House will, on Tuesday, grill former Attorney General William Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Next month, they’ll question Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The response: Mr. Trump attacked the F.B.I. and its former top officials on Twitter over news of the investigation and denied The Post’s report.ImagePresident Bill Clinton making a statement on a 21-day government shutdown during his administration.CreditDavid Scull/The New York TimesThe longest U.S. government shutdown ever.The partial shutdown is now the longest ever gap in American government funding, surpassing the previous record of 21 days under the Clinton administration in 1995.President Trump is still digging in on his demand for money for a wall at the southern border, though he has backed away from declaring a national emergency. House Democrats refuse to accede.Impact: Here’s a visual look at the shutdown’s far-reaching consequences for the 800,000 federal workers who are going without pay.The roots: Decisions made in the 1970s helped lay the groundwork for today’s dysfunction.Another angle: The British Parliament is all but certain to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan on Tuesday, leaving the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. mired in uncertainty.

The Trump administration sees it as an aggressive debt-trap scheme aimed at extending Beijing’s political influence around the world.Case study: In 2016, an American consortium of oil and gas executives from General Electric put in a bid to build a $4 billion oil refinery in Uganda that could be the largest in East Africa. It faced long odds against the competition, two Chinese energy companies with deep pockets, Beijing’s support and significant pull with the Ugandan government.Why it matters: The Ugandan case demonstrates the difficulties western governments face as they try to push back against China. In October, the Trump administration set aside $60 billion in financing for global projects — though that is still a fraction of what Beijing has pledged to spend.ImageYoung men being searched at a juvenile detention center in Kabul, Afghanistan.CreditKiana Hayeri for The New York TimesWhat’s to become of boys jailed as Taliban recruits?In Kabul, Afghanistan, dozens of boys are held at a juvenile detention center as national security threats, charged with planting, carrying or making bombs and trying to become suicide bombers.The Times, which was granted exclusive access to the prison a few months ago, found that many bear deep cuts and bruises — some self-inflicted, others from the bombs they are said to have detonated. None admit the full range of the crimes they’re accused of.“The Taliban made me fight for them,” said one. “The local police beat me to force me to confess,” said another.The problem: So far, counseling the boys to steer them away from extremism hasn’t seemed to work. So what are the authorities to do with them at the end of their sentences, when their added years could enable them to cause worse mayhem?

Her case has brought the status of Saudi women and the difficulties of escaping the kingdom into sharp focus.From Opinion: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Saudi Arabia to meet with the crown prince and discuss the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi.

That inquiry was taken over by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, when he was appointed.And The Washington Post first reported that the president had gone to great lengths to conceal his conversations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the past two years. Current and former officials told our reporters that this practice has caused anxiety within Mr. Trump’s own administration.Congress: Democrats in the House of Representatives might move to subpoena interpreters present at the meetings. And on Tuesday, they will grill former Attorney General William Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office, about his approach to the special counsel. Next month, they’ll question Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and they cautioned Mr. Trump against any attempt to influence or discourage his testimony. The response: Mr. Trump attacked the F.B.I. and its former top officials on Twitter over news of the counterintelligence investigation and denied The Post’s report.ImageSecret Service officers standing guard outside the White House on Sunday.

Meanwhile, a new caravan of migrants is forming in Honduras and promises to further charge the debate.Impact: Here’s a visual look at the shutdown’s far-reaching consequences for the 800,000 federal workers who are going without pay.Another angle: The British Parliament is all but certain to vote down Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan on Tuesday, leaving the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. mired in uncertainty.

But the deal infuriated the Greek defense minister, prompting him to resign. History: Greece has long effectively blocked Macedonia from NATO, insisting that Macedonians were a Hellenistic people and therefore the name could not be claimed by the Slavic people living in the country today. Many Greeks believe that the new name implies claims to Greek territory, because Greece has a northern region named Macedonia.What’s next? The confidence vote is expected to be held this week, after two days of debate from Tuesday morning.  The deal on the name could go before the Greek Parliament for approval as soon as this month.

The culprits are migrant smugglers. They are increasingly secreting migrants, mainly Iranians who can afford the high costs, across the English Channel to Britain in small vessels, some of them stolen. Numbers: Last year, there were 78 crossings and attempts to cross the Channel, involving a total of about 500 migrants — 10 times as many as in 2017. More than half made it across. No one is known to have died so far, but there is fear that a fatality is inevitable. Impact: The relatively small numbers notwithstanding, headlines and anti-immigration politicians in Britain are calling it a crisis. Some French fishermen are vowing to sit up all night in their boats, cradling their guns.

5c6bb7e23a125f5075c0a5a3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/technology/youtube-conspiracy-stars.html,"Last month, the YouTube star Shane Dawson uploaded his new project: a 104-minute documentary, “Conspiracy Theories With Shane Dawson.”In the video, set to a spooky instrumental soundtrack, Mr. Dawson unspooled a series of far-fetched hypotheses. Among them: that iPhones secretly record their owners’ every utterance; that popular children’s TV shows contain subliminal messages urging children to commit suicide; that the recent string of deadly wildfires in California was set on purpose, either by homeowners looking to collect insurance money or by the military using a type of high-powered laser called a “directed energy weapon.”None of this was fact-based, of course, and some of the theories seemed more like jokey urban legends than serious accusations. Still, his fans ate it up. The video has gotten more than 30 million views, a hit even by Mr. Dawson’s standards. A follow-up has drawn more than 20 million views and started a public feud with Chuck E. Cheese’s, the restaurant chain, which was forced to deny claims that it recycles customers’ uneaten pizza slices into new pizzas.Mr. Dawson’s conspiracy series arrived at a particularly awkward moment for YouTube, which has been reckoning with the vast troves of misinformation and extreme content on its platform.In late January, the company announced that it was changing its recommendations algorithm to reduce the spread of “borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.” It cited, as examples, “videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.”Mr. Dawson, whose real name is Shane Lee Yaw, has more than 20 million subscribers and a devoted teenage fan base. He has built his lucrative career by, among other talents, understanding what kinds of content plays well on YouTube.For years, that meant conspiracy theories — lots and lots of them, all delivered with the same wide-eyed credulity. In a 2016 video, he wondered aloud if the first Apollo moon landing was staged by NASA. (“It’s a theory,” he said, “but, I mean, all the evidence is not looking good.”) In 2017, he discussed the false theory that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a hoax. (“I know it’s crazy,” he said, “but just look at some of these videos.”) And last year, he devoted a segment of a video to flat-earth theory, which he concluded “kind of makes sense.”In fairness, Mr. Dawson is a far cry from partisan cranks like Alex Jones, the Infowars founder, who was barred by YouTube and other social networks last year for hate speech. Most of Mr. Dawson’s videos have nothing to do with conspiracies, and many are harmless entertainment.But the popularity of Mr. Dawson’s conspiracy theories illuminates the challenge YouTube faces in cleaning up misinformation. On Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, the biggest influencers largely got famous somewhere else (politics, TV, sports) and have other vectors of accountability. But YouTube’s stars are primarily homegrown, and many feel — not entirely unreasonably — that after years of encouraging them to build their audiences with viral stunts and baseless rumor-mongering, the platform is now changing the rules on them.Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson’s videos contain precisely the type of viral misinformation that YouTube now says it wants to limit. And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform’s biggest stars?A representative for Mr. Dawson did not respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said: “We recently announced that we’ve started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways. This is a gradual change and will get more and more accurate over time.”Part of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook — which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm — is that the definition of “harmful” misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.Take, for example, Mr. Jones’s assertion that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax perpetrated by gun control advocates. That theory, first dismissed as outrageous and loony, took on new gravity after Mr. Jones’s supporters began harassing the grieving parents of victims.Or take Pizzagate, a right-wing conspiracy theory that alleged that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were secretly running a child-sex ring. The theory, which was spread in a variety of videos on YouTube and other platforms, might have remained an internet oddity. But it became a menace when a believer showed up at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle, vowing to save the children he believed were locked in the basement.To its credit, YouTube has taken some minor steps to curb misinformation. Last year, it began appending Wikipedia blurbs to videos espousing certain conspiracy theories, and changed the way it handles search results for breaking news stories so that reliable sources are given priority over opportunistic partisans. And last summer, it was among the many social networks to bar Mr. Jones and Infowars.In a multipart Twitter thread this month, Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube software engineer, called the company’s decision to change its recommendation algorithm a “historic victory.”Mr. Chaslot noted that this algorithm — which was once trained to maximize the amount of time users spend on the site — often targeted vulnerable users by steering them toward other conspiracy theory videos it predicts they will watch.The change “will save thousands from falling into such rabbit holes,” he wrote.In an interview last week, Mr. Chaslot was more circumspect, saying YouTube’s move may have amounted to a “P.R. stunt.” Because the change will affect only which videos YouTube recommends — conspiracy theories will still show up in search results, and they will still be freely available to people who subscribe to the channels of popular conspiracy theorists — he called it a positive but insufficient step.“It will address only a tiny fraction of conspiracy theories,” he said.Last year, Mr. Chaslot built a website, AlgoTransparency.org, to give outsiders a glimpse of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms at work. The site draws from a list of more than 1,000 popular YouTube channels, and calculates which videos are most often recommended to people who watch those channels’ videos.On many days, conspiracy theories and viral hoaxes top the list. One recent day, the most frequently recommended video was “This Man Saw Something at Area 51 That Left Him Totally Speechless!,” which was recommended to viewers of 138 channels. The second most recommended video, which linked a series of recent natural disasters to apocalyptic prophecies from the Book of Revelation, was recommended to viewers of 126 of those top channels.In our conversation, Mr. Chaslot suggested one possible solution to YouTube’s misinformation epidemic: new regulation.Lawmakers, he said, could amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the law that prevents platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for content posted by their users. The law now shields internet platforms from liability for all user-generated content they host, as well as the algorithmic recommendations they make. A revised law could cover only the content and leave platforms on the hook for their recommendations.“Right now, they just don’t have incentive to do the right thing,” Mr. Chaslot said. “But if you pass legislation that says that after recommending something 1,000 times, the platform is liable for this content, I guarantee the problem will be solved very fast.”But even new laws governing algorithmic recommendations wouldn’t reverse the influence of YouTube celebrities like Mr. Dawson. After all, many of his millions of views come from his fans, who subscribe to his channel and seek out his videos proactively.YouTube’s first challenge will be defining which of these videos constitute “harmful” misinformation, and which are innocent entertainment meant for an audience that is largely in on the joke.But there is a thornier problem here. Many young people have absorbed a YouTube-centric worldview, including rejecting mainstream information sources in favor of platform-native creators bearing “secret histories” and faux-authoritative explanations.When those creators propagate hoaxes and conspiracy theories as part of a financially motivated growth strategy, it seeps in with some percentage of their audience. And sometimes — in ways no algorithm could predict — it leads viewers to a much darker place.It’s possible that YouTube can still beat back the flood of conspiracy theories coursing through its servers. But doing it will require acknowledging how deep these problems run and realizing that any successful effort may look less like a simple algorithm tweak, and more like deprogramming a generation."

The war there is America’s longest.CreditTyler Hicks/The New York TimesStart of a peace plan in AfghanistanAmerican and Taliban officials have agreed in principle on a framework for a peace deal, the chief U.S. negotiator confirmed today, the first tangible step toward ending a 17-year war that has cost tens of thousands of lives.The details: The plan centers on a phased withdrawal of American troops in exchange for a Taliban cease-fire. The insurgent group would also pledge not to allow international terrorist groups to use Afghanistan as a hub. What’s next: The Taliban are debating the requirement that the group enter talks with the Afghan government and agree to a lasting cease-fire, two points they have long resisted.Another angle: The idea of a U.S. troop withdrawal worries Afghan women, who fear that their rights will be taken away.Shutdown is over, but the clock is tickingNegotiators from the House and Senate have less than three weeks to hash out a plan to secure the southwestern border, after President Trump signed a stopgap funding bill last week to end the partial government shutdown. Mr. Trump said he would shut down the government again or invoke emergency powers to build a wall if Congress doesn’t offer a solution he likes by Feb. 15.What’s next: Lawmakers will now demonstrate whether a divided government can produce results beyond a budget. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Trump are also likely to discuss rescheduling the State of the Union address.Perspective: “Tearing down, or refusing to fund, border walls won’t get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice,” an author and editor at The Nation argues in an Op-Ed.America’s 5G arms race with ChinaOver the past year, the Trump administration has been pressuring allies to prevent Huawei and other Chinese companies from helping to build the next generation of cellular networks.The U.S. has suggested to Poland that future deployments of American troops could hinge on whether the country works with Huawei. In Germany, American officials warned that using Chinese telecoms equipment would pose a security risk to NATO.Why it matters: “In an age when the most powerful weapons, short of nuclear arms, are cyber-controlled, whichever country dominates 5G will gain an economic, intelligence and military edge for much of this century,” our national security correspondents write.What’s next? The U.S. campaign may complicate trade talks with China this week, particularly as Beijing demands the release of a Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada at America’s request.Explainer: Here’s what you need to know about the once-in-a-decade upgrade to wireless systems.

5c50ef9f3a125f5075c06fe4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/artificial-intelligence-surveillance.html,"Around the end of each year major dictionaries declare their “word of the year.” Last year, for instance, the most looked-up word at Merriam-Webster.com was “justice.” Well, even though it’s early, I’m ready to declare the word of the year for 2019.The word is “deep.”Why? Because recent advances in the speed and scope of digitization, connectivity, big data and artificial intelligence are now taking us “deep” into places and into powers that we’ve never experienced before — and that governments have never had to regulate before. I’m talking about deep learning, deep insights, deep surveillance, deep facial recognition, deep voice recognition, deep automation and deep artificial minds.Some of these technologies offer unprecedented promise and some unprecedented peril — but they’re all now part of our lives. Everything is going deep.Which is why it may not be an accident that one of the biggest hit songs today is “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born.” The main refrain, sung by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is: “I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in. … We’re far from the shallow now.”We sure are. But the lifeguard is still on the beach and — here’s what’s really scary — he doesn’t know how to swim! More about that later. For now, how did we get so deep down where the sharks live?The short answer: Technology moves up in steps, and each step, each new platform, is usually biased toward a new set of capabilities. Around the year 2000 we took a huge step up that was biased toward connectivity, because of the explosion of fiber-optic cable, wireless and satellites.Suddenly connectivity became so fast, cheap, easy for you and ubiquitous that it felt like you could touch someone whom you could never touch before and that you could be touched by someone who could never touch you before.Around 2007, we took another big step up. The iPhone, sensors, digitization, big data, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing melded together and created a new platform that was biased toward abstracting complexity at a speed, scope and scale we’d never experienced before. So many complex things became simplified. Complexity became so fast, free, easy to use and invisible that soon with one touch on Uber’s app you could page a taxi, direct a taxi, pay a taxi, rate a taxi driver and be rated by a taxi driver.Over the last decade, these advances in the speed of connectivity and the elimination of complexity have grown exponentially. Because as big data got really big, as broadband got really fast, as algorithms got really smart, as 5G got actually deployed, artificial intelligence got really intelligent. So now, with no touch — but just a voice command or machines acting autonomously — we can go so much deeper in so many areas.Scientists and doctors can now find the needle in the haystack of health data as the norm, not the exception, and therefore see certain disease patterns that were never apparent before. Machines can recognize your face so accurately that the Chinese government can punish you for jaywalking in Beijing, using street cameras, and you will never encounter a police officer. Indeed, with today’s facial recognition technology, I can dispense with the card reader at my office’s security gate and instead use each employee’s face as an ID. And cars can drive on their own.DeepMind, the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s parent, developed an A.I. program, AlphaGo, that has now defeated the world’s top human players of the ancient strategy game Go — which is much more complex than chess — by learning from human play. As The Times reported, DeepMind “showed yet another way that computers could be developed to perform better than humans in highly complex tasks” and to “mimic the way the brain functions.” DeepMind’s next breakthrough, AlphaZero, did not even need to learn from humans. It learned even faster by repeatedly playing against itself!Today “virtual agents” — using conversational interfaces powered by artificial intelligence — can increasingly understand your intent when you call the bank, credit card company or insurance company for service, just by hearing your voice. It means machines can answer so many more questions than nonmachines, also known as “humans.” The percentage of calls a chatbot, or virtual agent, is able to handle without turning the caller over to a person is called its “containment rate,” and these rates are steadily soaring. Soon, automated systems will be so humanlike that they will have to self-identify as machines.Automation is also going deep, fast. The Times’s Kevin Roose quoted Mohit Joshi, the president of Infosys, a technology firm that helps other businesses automate their operations, as saying in Davos last week: “People are looking to achieve very big numbers. Earlier they had incremental, 5 to 10 percent goals in reducing their work force. Now they’re saying, ‘Why can’t we do it with 1 percent of the people we have?’”But bad guys, who are always early adopters, also see the same potential to go deep in wholly new ways. They can fake your face and voice so well that they can create a YouTube video that will go viral of you saying racist things or make it look like the president of the United States just announced a nuclear attack on Russia. They can use technology to fake a bank manager’s voice so well that it can call your grandmother, and, with a voice command, ask her to transfer $10,000 to an account in Switzerland and she’ll do it — and you’ll never catch them in time.That’s why the adjective that so many people are affixing to all of these new capabilities to convey their awesome power is “deep.”On Jan. 20, The London Observer looked at Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff’s new book, the title of which perfectly describes the deep dark waters we’ve entered: “The Age of Surveillance Capital.”“Surveillance capitalism,” Zuboff wrote, “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‘machine intelligence,’ and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioral futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behavior.”Unfortunately, we have not developed the regulations or governance, or scaled the ethics, to manage a world of such deep powers, deep interactions and deep potential abuses.Two quotes tell that story: Last April, Senator Orrin Hatch was questioning Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg during a joint hearing of the commerce and judiciary committees. At one point Hatch asked Zuckerberg, “So, how do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?”Zuckerberg, clearly trying to stifle a laugh, replied, “Senator, we run ads.” Hatch did not seem to understand that Facebook’s business model is to mine users’ data and then run targeted ads — and Hatch was one of Facebook’s regulators.But then Zuckerberg was also clueless about how deep the powers of the Facebook platform had gone — deep enough that a few smart Russian hackers could manipulate it to help Donald Trump win the presidency.When faced with evidence that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed that notion as a “pretty crazy idea.” It turns out that it was happening at an industrial scale and he later had to apologize.Regulations often lag behind new technologies, but when they move this fast and cut this deep, that lag can be really dangerous. I wish I thought that catch-up was around the corner. I don’t. Our national discussion has never been more shallow — reduced to 280 characters.This has created an opening and burgeoning demand for political, social and religious leaders, government institutions and businesses that can go deep — that can validate what is real and offer the public deep truths, deep privacy protections and deep trust.But deep trust and deep loyalty cannot be forged overnight. They take time. That’s one reason this old newspaper I work for — the Gray Lady — is doing so well today. Not all, but many people, are desperate for trusted navigators. Many will also look for that attribute in our next president, because they sense that deep changes are afoot. It is unsettling, and yet, there’s no swimming back. We are, indeed, far from the shallow now.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
5c667fee3a125f5075c09dd8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/movies/52-places-traveler-movies.html,"I can’t remember what country I was flying over, or even what month it was, just that the “Mamma Mia!” sequel, “Here We Go Again,” was playing on the back of the airplane seat in front of me and I was sobbing like I had never sobbed before.One survey shows that even 41 percent of men will tear up at 10,000 feet. It has to do with the air pressure, dehydration, the stress of being herded like cattle, and the bloody marys we down to get through it all. I’d certainly done my fair share of crying on planes, as The New York Times’s first 52 Places Traveler, charged with the incredible and often body-punishing task of reporting on all those destinations while traveling solo around the world for a year.This was a different kind of cry, though. It was a movie cry, induced by that magical alchemy of Abba songs and a plotline that reminded me of my own quite alive, free-spirited mother whom I hadn’t seen in months and missed very much. Pop culture tends to reflect us back onto ourselves, and crammed into my tiny economy-class corner of that plane, watching two generations of actresses sing about finding inner strength while abroad, it may have been the first time I felt truly homesick. I missed my friends and my family, sure, but I also missed this, the cleansing power of getting swept up in the emotion of something I was watching or hearing — much to the discomfort of my seatmates.Before 52 Places, I had spent more than a decade as a culture writer for New York magazine. Of all the things I was leaving to embark on this experience of a lifetime — my loved ones, my job, my apartment — pop culture felt like the one link to home I could carry around in my pocket and rely on to keep me company when everyone I knew was asleep in a different time zone. Then as the trip went on, I got busy, the relationship grew distant. This essential pillar of my life began to crumble.MOVIES ARE MY COMFORT FOOD, and have been since I was 8 and my parents gave me my first memorable Christmas gift: a VHS tape of “Singin’ in the Rain,” which I watched on repeat for the next five years. As an isolated teenager in New Mexico, all I had to do was drive half an hour to the abundance of movie theaters around Santa Fe to visit other countries and lives. And as an adult, pop culture wasn’t something I consumed casually. I breathed it, partly because my job required it and partly because I loved being in the know. TV shows I’d missed the night before, I’d stream on Hulu over breakfast. Podcasts got me through my morning subway commute. Daytimes, I’d be reporting on something I’d seen. Evening brought more movie-viewing and conversations with friends about the entertainment-industry tissue that connected us all.Had weight and size not been an issue, I would’ve packed a small screening room in my luggage.In lieu of that, I had an iPad, iPod and iPhone prepped with enough downloads to get me through 2020. What if I found myself on consecutive five-hour flights with nothing to entertain me? How else would I make my way through a hundred dinners alone in unfamiliar cities?I was armoring myself with the familiar, in my native language — movies, music, TV shows, books — to ward off my fears of everything new and scary. After an exhausting day of speaking Spanish in Costa Rica, I could unwind with an episode of “Orange Is the New Black.” Stuck in the limbo of a logistical snag? That was just the right amount of time to indulge in a rom-com on Netflix, or text with my friends back home about that rom-com on Netflix.Then, on the first plane ride of my trip, from New York to New Orleans, I was too nervous and excited to look at my iPad. More plane and train and bus and car rides went by, and the iPad stayed in the bag, as I slept, or worked, or watched incredible scenery. Soon it became dead weight, an annoyance that only left my bag at airport security checks. I barely noticed when I forgot it in a Denver hotel room; then, five months in, I left it at a friend’s house in Los Angeles and never missed it.That worry of being bored never came up again. Culture was all around me. I went to more museums that I had in five years. (Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo and the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver were highlights). I never heard Ariana Grande’s song thanking her exes, but I can say definitively that “Despacito” was the most popular song on the planet in 2018. There are talented street musicians everywhere from Belgrade, Serbia, to La Paz, Bolivia, who can play it ably on everything from accordions to trumpets.It wasn’t until old friends started tweeting out their Top 10 lists for the year that I realized I’d seen only six movies, all on planes or Netflix: “Mamma Mia 2,” “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” “Set It Up,” that one where the Rock goes “Die Hard” on a skyscraper, and two Netflix Christmas movies.They’d been delightful, but the real treat came this January on the plane back from Taiwan to the United States at the end of my 52 Places trip, when “Crazy Rich Asians” popped up on my seatback screen. It was just over six months since it came out and I squealed with excitement to the nice Chinese girl sitting next to me. She didn’t speak much English, but she nodded, smiling, and turned on a Chinese-language soap opera for herself.For months, I’d been devouring Twitter threads and think pieces about the impact of “Crazy Rich Asians.” I’d followed along as three Korean friends from New York magazine tweeted about seeing it together, and weeping, for the third time. Over the years I’d written about the lack of realistic Asian representation in American pop culture because I’d felt it, too. A history teacher saying “ching-chong-chong” and slanting his eyes while teaching my class about China in middle school. Asian men like my dad being used as the butt of sexual jokes.So much of coming home after a profound experience like a long trip, especially one taken alone, is reckoning with how much you’ve changed and how much everything you left behind has stayed the same. But while I was gone, Hollywood had changed.I watched the penultimate scene three times: Hollywood’s new star, Henry Golding, rushes onto an airplane to get back the girl (a radiant Constance Wu), in a clichéd moment straight out of a dozen rom-coms. It didn’t feel clichéd or over the top. I’d just come from two months of tasting the richness of Asian cultures in India, Bhutan, Japan, China, South Korea, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, and that scene felt right, like it had a place in the world I’d been fortunate enough to see over the last year. And then I watched the whole movie over again.A WEEK AFTER I GOT BACK, I went to Utah for the tail end of the Sundance Film Festival, which I’d attended for years as a January ritual for work. Some people were surprised that I’d headed back on the road so soon, but wandering around Park City, puzzling out how to make it to screenings in the middle of a snowstorm, felt more like home to me than the apartment I hadn’t lived in for a year.Home is full of uncertainty and questions about the future. Crying alone in a dark theater, now that is something I know how to do.At first, my selections were shaky. I started off with a dull Keira Knightley whistle-blower drama I’d picked on reflex, because I was used to seeing movies with stars I could interview. Soon, though, I found myself drawn to foreign dramas and documentaries that could take me back to the places I’d been and missed so much. A rom-com, “Top End Wedding,” transported me to Darwin, Australia, and into the lives of Aboriginal families like the ones I had briefly met in October. “Monos,” a spectacularly shot Colombian psychodrama about child soldiers, brought me deep into the jungles of a country I long to revisit. “Midnight Traveler,” shot entirely on smartphones by a family of Afghan refugees, showed me a side of border crossings I’d never encountered.One night, the young filmmakers and journalists in our rental condo were having a party. I took a bus back there after watching a harrowing documentary, “One Child Nation,” about Chinese population control policy, and found myself standing in the street, unable to go in. Heavy snow was falling, turning the light from the streetlamps into lace. Music wafted down the stairs, and in the window I could see silhouettes of happy revelers with red Solo cups. A coming-of-age drama about a young Muslim girl was showing at a theater not too far away. Another dark room, another world to visit. I turned around and got on a bus."

Many have closed because of falling demand for newspapers and magazines.CreditCreditWANG JING / CHINA DAILYZhang Fan, 33, stopped by a newsstand one recent Sunday morning near his home in Beijing to buy a magazine, only to find the stand had been shut down.Zhang, a designer living on the Guangqumenwai Street in Chaoyang district, used to visit a stand about 546 yards from his residential community to buy newspapers and magazines.But since he’s started to read news and other material on his phone, he can count on one hand the number of times he has visited the stand in 2017. He had not even noticed it had been closed for the past four months.Due to falling demand for newspapers and magazines, newsstands in many cities have been closing. They have also been criticized for obstructing roads and sidewalks and for generally being eyesores.The Beijing municipal government has decided to upgrade and regulate the city’s newsstands by turning them into “innovative reading spaces” and “convenient service providers” to better serve the public.Li Zhigang, who is in his 40s and comes from Anhui province, runs a different newsstand in Guangqumenwai.“I haven’t been given any notice of closure, but I noticed most newsstands within the Second Ring Road were torn down this year,” he said. “I don’t know any details about the new policy, but I hope I can continue my business.”According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of City Management, the city’s newsstands will be better located based on passenger flow, the number of people living in nearby residential communities, and public demand.Under the plan drafted by the commission and the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, newsstands will become more like convenience stores and be “more fashionable”.The plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. An official with the commission, who declined to be named, said the plan clearly states that the number of newsstands in the city should be based on public need.“There is no easy way to solve the contradiction between people who love the printed word and have the habit of buying from the newsstands, and the owners’ continued operational losses,” the official said. “It’s also difficult to decide which department is responsible for footing the bill to upgrade newsstands.”The commission － and many people in Beijing － wants the streets to be wider and cleaner. With this in mind, it introduced a regulation in summer last year banning all 352 newsstands in the downtown districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng from selling food and drinks. Three stands were closed for selling food illegally.Since then, many stands in the two districts have closed because most of their business came from food and drinks, while sales of newspapers and magazines were highly unprofitable.There are 1,186 newsstands in the city, of which 306 － that are not in the two districts － are licensed to sell food and drinks.The closure of stands has attracted public attention, with many people, especially the elderly, strongly opposed to administrative intervention, as they have happy memories of visiting them.Some people raised the idea of introducing newspaper vending machines, which are clean and convenient, but China Post Group is unwilling to pay for them as it believes they would be too costly to set up and they would not make a profit, according to an industry insider who declined to be named.The official with the commission said: “The new policy has considered all aspects, and attempts to solve problems. We put the public interest first. The city will not keep a newsstand running for just a few people. Also, we won’t remove a stand that has a good turnover. It all depends on the market and needs.”Generally, newsstands will be closer to their customers after they are moved to residential communities or become part of convenience stores. The government will make those that remain more attractive, the official said.Newsstands may be facing pressures now, but they have had their good days.Yang Na, who is in her 50s and comes from Hebei province, started running a stand in Beijing in 1998. In 2002, she bought her first apartment in the capital for 400,000 yuan ($58,000) － money she made from selling newspapers and magazines.Before the internet became widely available, and with Beijing being the country’s cultural and political center, most people liked to get their news from newspapers and television bulletins.In 1997, the Beijing municipal government made setting up newsstands a city-level project and approved 75 stands that year.In 1999, the city began setting up newsstands on a large scale. Two years later, the authorities decided to regulate the stands through an overall planning, management and supply channel.The peak year was 2008, when the city had 2,500 newsstands, more than twice the number now.At that time, Yang’s stand sold only newspapers and magazines. Her profit was about 7,000 yuan a month. Ten years later, she makes almost the same amount with the help of food and drink sales.“I miss the days in 2007 when I sold several boxes of fashion magazines each day,” she said.Arrival of iPhone
On Jan. 9, 2007, Steve Jobs, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Apple Inc., announced the arrival of the iPhone at his company in the United States.Since then, smartphones and the mobile internet have rapidly changed the reading habits of people worldwide.Yang said: “From 2009, business started to decline. And it’s never picked up again.”During a one-hour interview with Yang at her newsstand, seven customers arrived to buy drinks; four bought cigarettes and only one bought a newspaper.The man who bought the paper said: “It’s very convenient to have newsstands. I hope they will be kept by the authorities. As for food and drinks, I don’t care. If they want to ban them for safety reasons, this is fine by me.”A customer who bought cigarettes said he had not bought any newspapers or magazines at this stand for years, adding, “It’s just a cigarettes stand for me.”Yang said she might start another small business, or retire if she cannot continue to run her newsstand.“If there is a chance, I hope I can continue my newsstand business because I have been doing this for so long and many people living nearby come to buy newspapers or magazines regularly. We have become friends despite only exchanging a few words over the years. People know me,” she said.More important, Yang said business is not as bad as some people think. As long as she can continue to sell food, drinks and cigarettes, the income can sustain her in Beijing, despite the high cost of living.According to China Post Group, the country had 30,506 newsstands at the end of 2014 － 20,000 fewer than in 2008.With the rise of the internet, and with newsstands starting to create problems such as obstructing roads and sidewalks, some cities have taken strict and quick action.In 2009, Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, removed 1,241 newsstands. In 2012, Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province, dismantled all 421 stands in the city and authorities said newspapers and magazines could be sold only in stores.Reading never dies
Luo Ping, a writer who lives in Beijing’s Tongzhou district, wrote to the authorities last year, saying that newsstands are still an important part of the city’s public cultural system and should not be neglected.She received a reply thanking her for her letter, and saying her views would be taken into account. However, she still fears for the stands’ future.“It is not easy to build a network of newsstands in a city. They are the closest cultural facilities to ordinary people,” Luo said. “They have a reason to exist.”Luo suggested that newsstand owners could try to sell innovative cultural products such as paper cuts and needlework to make up for the losses from selling newspapers.However, all items sold at newsstands need to be approved by the authorities.ImageMagazines are sold at 7-Eleven stores.CreditFENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILYDing Xiaozhe, 43, an accountant, said of the disappearance of newsstands near his home in Dongcheng district: “It’s a natural choice. Things that no longer fit with the times will be abandoned or fade away, which is reasonable.” Ding loves to read and was a loyal buyer of the magazines National Geographic and Chinese National Geography at newsstands.“Every time I moved apartments, I had to carry several heavy boxes of my prized magazines,” he said.“I love good memories, but times change. We can read so much information on cellphones, and order digital magazines online. There’s really no need to keep that many newsstands. Generally speaking, it’s a waste of social resources to keep something that’s old-fashioned.”Despite differing opinions about newsstands, the Beijing municipal government has decided to find a way to keep streets clean while allowing some of the stands to remain with upgraded facilities.In 2014, the central government outlined the capital’s core functions as the country’s political, cultural, international communications, and scientific and technological innovation center.Since then, as an ancient and traditional city, Beijing has started to use its advantages to strengthen its position as a cultural center.Measures have been introduced to protect old streets and relics, build new cultural landmarks, improve the libraries’ network and service, host cultural activities and provide subsidies to support bookstores.Meanwhile, in Russia, the government has drafted a plan suggesting there should be a newsstand for every 1,500 residents.In Paris, the authorities have attempted to expand the business scope of newsstands and reduce rents to help the owners. They allow the stands to sell food, drinks, souvenirs and candies to increase income.In Japan, there are convenience stores on nearly every street. Each community has more than one such store, which sell newspapers and magazines.Wang Hui, 33, the mother of a 6-year-old boy in Beijing, said she often buys cartoon and other magazines at a newsstand for him on her way home.“I want to protect his eyes by reducing the time he spends on his cellphone and other digital devices. He likes reading magazines. It’s better to buy them at newsstands, because in that way I don’t need to subscribe for a whole year,” she said.“I think that reading decides our kids’ futures. No matter whether there are newsstands or other places selling newspapers and magazines, reading will always continue in some way.”Du Juan"
5c44ae2a3a125f5075c05642,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/china-economy-growth-davos.html,"BEIJING — In the vast metropolis of Chongqing in western China, three huge Ford Motor assembly plants have slowed to a fraction of their earlier pace.In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.In Guangdong Province in the southeast, factories have idled workers in droves.China’s huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. On Monday, Chinese officials said that, during the last three months of 2018, the economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europe’s resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germany’s industrial engine starting to sputter.In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.“European investment in China is going down,” Cecilia Malmström, the European Union’s commissioner of trade, said during an interview in Washington. “That is more because it is becoming increasingly complicated to do business there, with the forced technology transfer, with the lack of transparency, discrimination as compared to Chinese companies, with the massive subsidies of state-owned companies.”For the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the Chinese economy could be the most pressing issue, even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world.China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, China’s economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the country’s headline figures are unreliable.Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.Apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones in China. Ford Motor cut output at its Chongqing joint venture by 70 percent in November, in what Ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars. Chemical industry experts said that mostly Chinese-owned chemical factories in Jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement.ImageFord Motor cut output at its Chongqing joint venture by 70 percent in November, in what Ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars.CreditAssociated PressThe question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as China slows, and how many investors will dump their shareholdings.“The global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to China’s growth and currency outlook,” said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. “The immediate financial linkages are relatively modest, but they are swamped by sentiment channels.”To be sure, further slowing in China is not the only risk the global economy faces. A disorderly British exit from the European Union or a financial crisis in debt-ridden Italy could also be unsettling. In the United States, the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year. The Federal Reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay, making it more expensive to borrow money, though it isn’t clear exactly what the American central bank will do.Still, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?The World Bank aptly titled its review of this year’s outlook “Darkening Prospects.” It warned that China’s slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it.China is the world’s second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan. But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.The global impact of the Chinese slowdown now underway could be limited if Beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth. Already this month, China has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines, at a combined cost of $148 billion. “The weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that they’ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving,” said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.Many of the biggest new construction projects are in China’s western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, China’s largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to China’s already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid China’s overall economy low in recent months.Vice Premier Liu He promised at Davos a year ago that China would rein in the growth of credit within three years. Chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the United States.ImageChina’s huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. Data released by Beijing in recent months shows softer investment, unprofitable factories and consumers who are no longer so quick to open their wallets.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThey set about putting stringent limits on the country’s extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country’s small and midsize enterprises, which China’s big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.But by the end of April, as the economy started slowing, Chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time. As credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash, top regulators expressed worry at a Shanghai financial conference in June that they might have already gone too far.At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.Less than a month after the Shanghai conference, the trade war began in earnest. President Trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from China. Corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late September, consumer confidence was crumbling. Purchases of big-ticket goods, especially cars, fell fast.Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.But quite a few say they still have confidence in China’s consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.“As long as we can create a level playing field,” said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to China’s cabinet, “private companies will surely succeed.”"
5c5743783a125f5075c07cfd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/briefing/lion-air-india-apple.html,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning.Boeing’s decision-making processes, India’s strategically bloated budget and Apple’s impact on the Chinese economy. Here’s the latest:ImageA Boeing employee examining the wiring of a 737 Max jet.CreditDavid Ryder/BloombergBehind the Lion Air crashIn 2010, Airbus announced it would introduce a more fuel-efficient version of its popular A320 jetliner. Within months, Boeing announced plans to upgrade its own 737 jets.In designing the new 737 Max, Boeing tried to avoid a complete overhaul of its systems so that it could persuade the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, that there would be no need for expensive, time-consuming retraining for pilots.That decision appears to have left the crew of the Lion Air jet that crashed in October, killing 189 people, without a full understanding of how to respond when faulty data led the flight control system to repeatedly push the plane’s nose down.How we know: Our journalists interviewed engineers, former Boeing employees, pilots, regulators and congressional aides to understand some of the choices Boeing made as it developed the 737 Max.The central problem: The Max’s enlarged engines had to be mounted differently, which had a destabilizing effect. A new, automatic flight control system was created to counter the possibility of stalls. It’s likely the Lion Air pilots weren’t made of aware of the system — or how to handle it in an emergency.The takeaway: Safety on modern jetliners is shaped by a complex combination of factors, including fierce industry competition, technological advances and pilot training. In the rare instances when things go awry, the interplay of those factors can create unintended and potentially fatal consequences.ImageStruggling farmers will be among the beneficiaries of India’s new national budget.CreditAnupam Nath/Associated PressIndia’s budget is packed with handoutsA new pension plan for rickshaw pullers. Tax breaks for the middle class. Cash handouts for struggling farmers.These are some of the financial gifts for voters in the government’s new budget, released just a few months before elections that could unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Analysis: Most analysts believe neither Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Indian National Congress Party will win an outright majority. That means regional and caste-based parties will probably become the kingmakers, and the farmers who make up the bulk of their voters will be major beneficiaries of the new budget. There are also some sweeteners for rickshaw pullers, tea sellers and others in the informal sector that makes up another large chunk of India’s economy.Background: Mr. Modi was elected in 2014 on a campaign pledge to provide more employment opportunities, but he and his ministers are under fire, accused of trying to bury an official jobs report that showed unemployment at a 45-year high.In other India news: The country lodged a formal complaint with the American government after an undercover operation to expose immigration fraud led to the arrest of several Indian students in January.ImageWorkers heading home from the Changshuo electronics factory in Huojiancun, China.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesApple’s slowdown hits Chinese workersChina’s factories, the manufacturers for the world, now meet domestic demand, too. And so they’re more vulnerable to the country’s weakening consumer demand and broader economic slowdown, made worse by China’s trade war with the U.S.We looked closely at Huojiancun, an area at the edge of glittering Shanghai where factory workers assemble Apple iPhones. Their dwindling paychecks aren’t just weakening their prospects but also the economic microcosm that emerged around them — a bustling night market and food stands.Impact: The cycle is worsening China’s economic slowdown, which has posed a major challenge for Beijing and could put it at a disadvantage in the trade war with President Trump.ImageKazuko Yoshida, 38, a graphic designer and mother of two young children in Tokyo, doing the family laundry after dinner. “My husband does not have a gender equality concept,” she said.CreditAndrea DiCenzo for The New York TimesHousework holds back Japanese women’s careersIn January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe boasted that 67 percent of women in Japan were working, an all-time high.But many are stuck in limited roles in the workplace, unable to advance in part because of rigid gender expectations that shoulder them with most of the domestic work.By the numbers: Women who work more than 49 hours a week do 25 hours of housework a week, according to an analysis of government numbers. Their husbands put in an average of less than five hours at home — among the lowest rates in the developed world. As a result, almost half of the country’s working women are employed part time, and more than half are on temporary contracts.Why it matters: Mr. Abe has prioritized what he calls “womenomics” to help boost Japan’s slowing economy, and analysts say that helping women reach higher-level jobs would help the country’s severe labor shortage. But cultural norms stand in the way.Here’s what else is happeningState of the Union: President Trump will deliver his yearly address to Congress on Tuesday night in Washington. Immigration, a topic that has led to weeks of political impasse, will be a main theme, the White House said.ImagePresident Trump sitting for an exclusive interview with The New York Times.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesIn the Oval Office: In an interview with our reporters last week, Mr. Trump said he had all but given up negotiating over his border wall and would most likely take action on his own. The Times’s publisher, A. G.

5c868e0249f0eacbf105c714,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/t-magazine/artists-destroy-past-work.html,"AS HE LAY dying in a Swiss hospital in 1977, Vladimir Nabokov worked away on a manuscript now known as “The Original of Laura (Dying Is Fun).” In it, Nabokov seems to be rehearsing his own death by imagining the demise of his protagonist, a neurologist named Philip, who is willing himself to die through meditation, declaring it to be “the greatest ecstasy known to man.” Nabokov claimed to have had the manuscript more or less complete in his mind, but at 78, and rapidly weakening from a lung infection, he was unable to get past his preliminary sketches, which he wrote on notecards. But he was still capable of anointing his wife, Véra, as his literary executor, stipulating that if the manuscript remained unfinished at the time of his death it be destroyed.For years following his death, it was possible to assume this was the case. But Véra’s “immeasurable love,” in the words of their only son, Dmitri, prevented her from destroying the manuscript, and following her death in 1991, the decision fell to him. Dmitri allowed two excerpts to be published in a Nabokov journal in 1999 before Knopf released the entire incomplete manuscript in 2009. It wasn’t the first time Nabokov wanted his work to disappear; at one point, as Dmitri writes in his introduction to “Laura,” Nabokov was “on the way to the incinerator” with a draft of “Lolita,” scared of what the public might think of his strange masterpiece, when Véra “snatched [it] from his grasp.”More often than not, we see someone destroying his work as an act of frustration and self-loathing, one that fits our culture’s view of artists as tortured souls, suffering for their creations, demolishing them in an act akin to infanticide. But the destructive impulse is a common one among artists, and not just among the self-defeating, which Nabokov could be. (He once described himself, at the height of his fame, as “an obscure, doubly obscure, novelist with an unpronounceable name.”) At a time in which it is expected — in fact, inevitable — to stumble upon some variety of Instagram image of an acquaintance “working on my novel (lol),” when the drunken ghosts of social media posts past can haunt the ether for eternity, when an overly sincere email is sent and cannot be retracted — the curious pull toward destruction, of a full and complete erasure, has become all the more desirable.But the urge to destroy art has a long history, and it can take many forms. In some cases, it is a mere disavowal of one’s early work: “It is not always easy for the inexperienced writer to distinguish between his own material and that which he would like to make his own,” Willa Cather wrote in 1922, in a somewhat pained preface to a new edition of her first, and still little-read, novel “Alexander’s Bridge” (1912). She was effectively pleading with her audience to dismiss the book, as she did, as little more than a historical artifact.Or destruction can symbolize a fresh start. For a 1970 piece titled “Cremation Project,” a 39-year-old John Baldessari — then teaching at the University of California, San Diego, and taking his art in a new direction, away from his earlier paintings — gathered a group of his students to help him destroy all of his unsold canvases from May 1953 to March 1966 that were still in his possession. After tearing and breaking apart the works, they brought them to a local mortuary to have them cremated. As the editors of Baldessari’s catalogue raisonné have noted, this act was “as much practical as therapeutic.” The reason for destroying can indeed be banal, but no less solid: The artist was preparing to move to Los Angeles for a teaching job at California Institute of the Arts, and he didn’t want to haul more than 100 old paintings that he didn’t like anymore with him. But the symbolic weight of this act is undeniable. Baldessari, now 87, keeps some of the ashes of these works in a book-shaped urn that is part of his collection, a reminder that at any point in a career, one can burn it down and begin again.IT IS NOW standard for “early work” to become a pejorative term for artists who are lucky enough to achieve a long career. Saul Bellow dismissed his first two novels, “Dangling Man” (1944) and “The Victim” (1947), as mere apprentice works, a kind of throat-clearing exercise in preparation for his masterpiece “The Adventures of Augie March” (1953). After she became famous, Georgia O’Keeffe bought back and destroyed several paintings that she felt had been damaged or altered by their owners, often through cleaning or conservation. (One early piece, a 1916 watercolor called “Red and Green II,” was long thought destroyed before appearing at a Christie’s auction in 2015.) Gerhard Richter destroyed several paintings from the early 1960s, including two depicting scenes of naval warfare, made while he was living in West Germany and trying to shed his roots as a Socialist Realist painter. He left these works out of his catalogue raisonné because they were not representative of his work.This attempt by a living artist to control a posthumous legacy is like serving as the artistic director for one’s own funeral. (At least one contemporary artist, Marina Abramovic, a healthy 72, has in fact published detailed instructions for her funeral, which will involve three coffins in three different cities — only one of them containing her real body — and Anohni singing “My Way.” Even in death, artists are controlling.) The effort to police one’s post-mortem career might appear like a contemporary phenomenon. The art industrial complex will buy and sell whatever scraps are available if one isn’t careful: A 1999 300-word blog post for Salon about “five direly underappreciated U.S. novels” was reprinted in David Foster Wallace’s 2012 posthumous collection “Both Flesh and Not.” And works today are rarely truly lost: Anyone with an internet connection can gain access to that exceptional portrait of the artist as a bumbling young nerd.Indeed, I sometimes can’t help lying awake at night, fully insecure in the knowledge that somewhere in the bowels of the internet exist several articles I wrote for my college newspaper. But despite our growing online record of cultural mediocrity, artists have been destroying their work for at least as long as people have been buying it. Audiences like the idea of a fully formed genius at least as much as the artists themselves. But the artist who seems to have simply arrived one day intact is often a disguise: In 1957, before her arrival in New York from Taos, N.M., as a Minimalist master of canvases in stark gray, the Canadian artist Agnes Martin had burned many of her early landscape paintings, erasing much of that history, and thus becoming herself.ONE OF THE EARLIEST known instances of an artist attempting to destroy his work comes from the 16th century, when Michelangelo partially defaced a marble Pietà. For reasons now lost to history, he hammered into Christ’s left leg and arm, destroying them before walking away from the work unfinished. (Theories for this range from Michelangelo’s frustration with the quality of marble to his fear of being exposed as a Protestant sympathizer in the midst of the Roman Inquisition.) Simple frustration has relegated a great deal of important work to history’s dustbin. Claude Monet threw out a number of his works in the latter half of his career. In 1908, dissatisfied with a series of waterlily paintings he was working on for an upcoming exhibition — and perhaps worried about his relevance in the face of a younger generation that included Pablo Picasso — he destroyed 15 of them, happier to see the works ruined than to face public scrutiny.But today, as our lives have become less object-based, the stakes of destruction, too, have shifted. Forcefully hitting delete on that email just isn’t the same as burning a stack of letters, though the outcome more or less is. Destroying one’s art has become a kind of art in itself, something between an inconvenient prank and clever treatise on contemporary value. The artist Cady Noland, who has not officially sanctioned the exhibition of her work in nearly 20 years, effectively “destroyed” a work in 2014 — “Log Cabin Facade” (1990) — after she learned that the piece’s original logs had been replaced in a restoration for which she was not consulted. “This is not an artwork,” she wrote to the collector who purchased the refabricated work in 2014, who recouped part of his money in a buyback clause and later tried, unsuccessfully, to recoup the rest in a lawsuit against the Berlin gallery that sold it to him. The artist’s disavowal — not a physical act but a verbal one — had rendered the piece as useless as if she’d personally set fire to it. Now all that remained was a log cabin facade.These days, now that visual art has become a prized commodity, this artistic disinheritance has become a not infrequent occurrence, the method of destruction of choice for 21st-century artists as well as an interesting moral and philosophical quandary. Following the 2016 election, Richard Prince returned payment for a 2014 painting of Ivanka Trump, part of the artist’s series of blown-up images of real Instagram posts (this one featuring the first daughter having her hair done and taking her picture with an iPhone in a mirror). On Twitter, Prince posted an image of the work and proclaimed, “This is not my work. I did not make it. I deny.”Whether such words have the strength of gasoline and a match in the long run is an ongoing discussion; it’s not clear if Prince’s work has or could be resold, or if it retains any actual value. What is clear is that we’ve now reached a point in which destroying a work can at the very least dredge up decent publicity on behalf of the destroyer, and maybe even produce a desirable object to own. At a Sotheby’s auction in London last October, a painting went up for sale by Banksy, an anonymous street artist known for his supposed wit. (Famous works include paintings on public buildings of a masked protester tossing a bouquet of flowers like a Molotov cocktail, or, painted on the roll-down gate of New York’s Hustler Club, a man in a suit holding wilted flowers.) Housed in an unusually thick frame, this painting featured a girl who had lost her grasp on a heart-shaped balloon and sold for $1.4 million. Moments after the gavel hit the auctioneer’s podium, the work slid through the frame, into a shredder hidden inside, triggered by an associate of the artist using a remote control. Sotheby’s, which makes attendees at its major sales apply for tickets and conducts detailed condition reports for the works it sells (and also maintains a culture of secrecy so complete in scope that a spokesperson would not even confirm whether people who work on their sales sign nondisclosure agreements), has denied any prior knowledge of or involvement in the stunt. But the damage was already done, so to speak. Some pundits praised the act as a brilliant anticapitalist critique, performed at one of the epicenters of insidious capital, while numerous art experts, each with a different stake in the artist’s market, proclaimed to the press about how the incident would most assuredly raise the value of the work. Our destruction, I suppose, is mutually assured.

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.Until we get the updated weather report from Punxsutawney Phil, it might remain best to stay inside, stay warm and stream. Below are the most interesting of what we’ve found among the new TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in February, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.)‘Generation Wealth’Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Amazon.It can be hard to tell whether the current obsession with the lifestyles of the rich and famous — now often referred to as Kardashian Syndrome — is old hat, or a sign of something seriously wrong with our society. The photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield investigates modern celebrity worship and the rampant consumerism that feeds into it by talking to bond traders, porn stars, child beauty pageant queens and the writer Bret Easton Ellis. Her film is most insightful, though, when she turns the camera on herself and her family and takes stock of their own values and aspirations. Could they be heading in the same sad direction as her other subjects?—‘Russian Doll’ Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Netflix.The many-layered “Russian Doll” is a sort of downtown “Groundhog Day” — Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a video game programmer, dies on the night of her 36th birthday party in the East Village, then wakes up to relive the same night and the same party all over again. And again. And again … Did she take a bad drug? Is she losing her mind? Or is something more existential in play? Lyonne, who created the show with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, is a revelation in this cleverly constructed, nearly perfect character study. —‘Velvet Buzzsaw’ Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Netflix.This supernatural satire takes us inside a pompous art scene in which the latest buzz surrounds the disturbing work of a recently deceased painter. The artist’s last wish was that all of his work be destroyed, but (spoiler alert) that doesn’t happen. Unpleasant, demonic occurrences unfold for anyone attempting to make a profit off the art, including a smug critic played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The writer-director Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”) finds plenty to laugh about even among the carnage. —‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Amazon.John Callahan (Joaquin Phoenix) became a heavy drinker at the age of 12 and, after a car accident, a quadriplegic at 21. Despite his troubled beginnings, Callahan went on to become a noted cartoonist who managed to find caustic humor in the subject of disability. In “Don’t Worry,” based on Callahan’s memoir, the director Gus Van Sant also finds biting wit and brings an airy sweetness to this offbeat tale. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill, Jack Black and Carrie Brownstein, is excellent. But this is Phoenix’s movie: He creates a portrait of a man who must learn how to bear this seemingly unbearable direction his life has suddenly taken and do so while making others laugh.—‘High Flying Bird’Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Netflix.In this intimate, complex basketball drama from Steven Soderbergh, Ray (André Holland) is a top sports agent strategizing to get his players paid during an NBA lockout — which means deftly navigating a maze of contract negotiations, power structures and racial dynamics before the clock runs out. Soderbergh shot “High Flying Bird” on an iPhone (as he did with his previous feature “Unsane”), reportedly in just two weeks. But this doesn’t feel like a rush job: Instead, Tarell Alvin McCraney’s (“Moonlight”) tight, subversive script feels urgent and thrilling even though most of the action takes place on the sidelines or in offices, not on the court. —ImageMaya Erskine, left, and Anna Konkle in “Pen15.”CreditAlex Lombardi/Hulu‘PEN15’ Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Hulu.Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle are fully grown adults, but in this coming-of-age comedy series co-produced by The Lonely Island, the actresses play versions of their 13-year-old selves in seventh grade. (All of their middle-school classmates are played by actual 13-year-olds. Wisely, when one of their characters has her first kiss, an adult’s lips stand in for the teenage actor’s in close up, minimizing the ick factor.) The series is as strange as it sounds, and maybe a little strained; but it mostly works because Erskine and Konkle are not that tall and slouch a lot. “Pen15” shows there’s fun to be had in mining the cognitive dissonance of grown-ups inserted into adolescent situations.—‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor’ Starts streaming: Feb. 9, on HBO.Morgan Neville’s documentary about Fred Rogers, the nicest neighbor in the history of television, is not an exposé revealing dark truths or secret scandals about the man inside the cardigan sweater. Instead, we learn that Rogers was a genuinely good person who saw his long-running show as a kind of ministry for children. (One of his sons calls him “the second Christ.”) Rogers himself might have felt as if he failed in his efforts to counter more popular, violent programming, but spending time with him here will make the world seem like a better place, at least for a little while.—‘The Umbrella Academy’ Season 1Starts streaming: Feb. 15, on Netflix.If Wes Anderson were inclined to make an emo superhero movie, it might turn out like “The Umbrella Academy.” Based on the hit graphic novel series by Gerard Way, the leader of the band My Chemical Romance, the series concerns a very dysfunctional family in which several gifted children have been adopted by an eccentric billionaire, given numbers for names and brought up to save the world. They’re also apparently in a competition to see which of them can be the most deadpan — while fending off an apocalypse, of course.—‘The Giant Beast That Is the Global Economy’ Starts streaming: Feb. 22, on Amazon.Remember the quick, funny, fourth-wall-breaking cameos sprinkled into Adam McKay’s “The Big Short,” featuring the likes of Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez? McKay has taken that same technique and stretched it out into an eight-part docu-series hosted by Kal Penn. The film includes comedians like Zach Galifianakis, Pete Holmes and Rashida Jones, who help explain such knotty subjects as bitcoin, counterfeiting and money laundering (which is way too easy to do, by the way). Should you be appalled, or just take notes?—ImageThe triplets of “Three Identical Strangers.”CreditNeon‘Three Identical Strangers’ Starts streaming: Feb. 26, on Hulu.This disturbing documentary profiles a set of triplets separated as infants and adopted by three separate families. As young adults, the brothers reconnect by chance and even land a cameo in the Madonna movie “Desperately Seeking Susan.” Squint your eyes and this could almost pass for a feel-good reunion story. But it turns out social engineering has been at play and an insidious narrative is revealed. The more the brothers learn about their past, the more they wonder who they really are, and why.Also Arriving This Month:New to Amazon Prime Video: “The ABC Murders” (Feb. 1), “The Blues Brothers” (Feb. 1), “Four Weddings and a Funeral” (Feb. 1), “Marathon Man” (Feb. 1), “The Matrix” (Feb. 1), “The Portrait of a Lady” (Feb. 1), “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (Feb. 1), “Thelma & Louise” (Feb. 1), “Wayne’s World” (Feb. 1), “The Expanse” Season 3 (Feb. 8), “White Dragon” Season 1 (Feb. 8) and “The Party” (Feb. 17).—New to Hulu: “The Big Lebowski” (Jan. 1), “Born on the Fourth of July” (Feb. 1), “Caddyshack” (Feb. 1), “Capote” (Feb. 1), “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (Feb. 1), “Dazed and Confused” (Feb. 1), “Field of Dreams” (Feb. 1), “Four Weddings and a Funeral” (Feb. 1), “Hairspray” (Feb. 1), “Marathon Man” (Feb. 1), “Mississippi Burning” (Feb. 1), “Moonstruck” (Feb. 1), “Mystic Pizza” (Feb. 1), “The Portrait of a Lady” (Feb. 1), “The Royal Tenenbaums” (Feb. 1), “The Secret Garden” (Feb. 1), “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (Feb. 1), “Thelma & Louise” (Feb. 1), “Three Kings” (Feb. 1), “Wayne’s World” (Feb. 1), “Wedding Crashers” (Feb. 1), “Legion” Season 2 (Feb. 3), “The Party” (Feb. 17) and “The Sisters Brothers” (Feb. 18).—New to HBO: “The Bourne Identity” (Feb. 1), “Collateral” (Feb. 1), “The Pelican Brief” (Feb. 1), “Sunshine” (Feb. 1), “2 Dope Queens” Season 2 Premiere (Feb. 8), “Deadpool 2” (Feb. 16), “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” Season 6 Premiere (Feb. 18), “It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It” (Feb. 23) and “O.G.” (Feb. 23).—New to Netflix: “About a Boy” (Feb. 1), “As Good as It Gets” (Feb. 1), “Billy Elliot” (Feb. 1), “Hairspray” (Feb. 1), “Jaws” (Feb. 1), “Pretty in Pink” (Feb. 1), “The Edge of Seventeen” (Feb. 1), “Velvet Buzzsaw” (Feb. 1), “Ray Romano: Right Here, Around the Corner” (Feb. 5), “One Day at a Time” Season 3 (Feb. 8), “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” Volume 2 (Feb. 10), “Ken Jeong: You Complete Me, Ho” (Feb. 14), “The Breaker Upperers” (Feb. 15), “Larry Charles’ Dangerous World of Comedy” (Feb. 15), “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” (Feb. 16) and “Paddleton” (Feb. 22)."
5c4fc1b53a125f5075c06cca,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/smarter-living/podcast-recommendations-apps.html,"As a content-obsessed millennial, I have made podcasts part of my daily routine for years. I listen while commuting, cooking, running errands, putting away laundry, washing dishes or during any relatively mindless activity that can be done while wearing wireless headphones.My bond with podcasts is so cemented that it comes as a shock when someone I meet at a party — or someone in my family, or a friend I thought I knew — tells me that they, in the year 2019, do not listen to podcasts. And never have. And don’t really get what it’s all about. And, worse, don’t quite know how to start.Their reasons range from “I don’t have time” to “It’s passed me by” to “What should I even listen to?” Luckily, those concerns are easily answered and dispatched. For anyone who wants to become a full-fledged podcast listener, here’s what you need to know to get into it, from experts who know best.Find the right appTo keep and organize your podcasts, you’ll need a podcast app that allows you to subscribe to new shows and listen. If you’re brand-new to podcasts, the stock podcast app already installed on your smartphone is the easiest point of entry; for iPhone, you have the Apple Podcasts app, and for Android users, the easiest option is to play podcasts through the Play Music app.Beyond that, there is a huge range of third-party apps to choose from, but the app I use regularly and like best — and the favorite among the podcast experts interviewed for this article — is Pocket Casts, which costs a one-time payment of $3.99 on both Android and iOS.Nicholas Quah, who writes the podcast industry newsletter Hot Pod and is a podcast critic for Vulture, uses six different podcast apps, but prefers Pocket Casts. Dana Gerber-Margie, co-founder of the Bello Collective, a volunteer-run podcast review website and newsletter, has used many apps, most recently Stitcher, and made the switch to Pocket Casts because others “couldn’t handle the amount of subscriptions that I was maintaining.” (Currently, she subscribes to 1,427 podcasts in all and regularly listens to between 40 and 50.)Jody Avirgan, podcast host for FiveThirtyEight and ESPN’s “30 for 30,” too, uses Pocket Casts, because of the way it’s filtered and organized, but emphasized there’s not “a huge difference between the apps, especially for someone who’s totally starting from scratch.”Take the show on the roadNow that you have an app, make sure you can listen wherever and whenever you have the most time. Podcasts are all about killing two birds with one stone by listening while you do other things. For Mr. Quah of Hot Pod, “that’s part of the fun of it.”“A lot of the world feels a little boring sometimes, so having that layer on top of it is great,” he said.[Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]For many people, commuting by car takes up a large chunk of the day, so make sure your ride is wired for sound. For those using mass transit, I cannot recommend enough a pair of sound-cancelling headphones. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, picked the Sony H.ear On 2 headphones as its favorite. But if that’s too steep a cost, at least invest in a pair of wireless earbuds; for those, Wirecutter recommends the Jabra Elite 65t. Once you banish cords from your life and can connect your phone with the touch of a button, your podcast habit will kick into high gear.Beyond that, I’d recommend getting a cheap, portable Bluetooth speaker at home. I carry mine around the house as I’m puttering, sticking it in a cabinet in the kitchen, on a shelf in the hall or in a nook outside the shower to fully maximize my podcast-listening time. (And for those who want their speaker inside the shower, get a waterproof model: Wirecutter recommends the Tribit X-Boom.)Find the things you really want to hearNow that you have your app and gadgets, you’re ready for the fun part: finding podcasts you’re going to love.If it feels overwhelming, it’s not just you: Though podcasts have been around for at least a decade, there’s still no central database or clearinghouse for the thousands of podcasts out there, Ms. Gerber-Margie said.“A lot of discovery happens via the way you choose to listen. There’s no ‘New York Times best-seller list,’” she said.However, big podcasting powerhouses are a great first place to look. National Public Radio produces many worthwhile podcasts, including “Invisibilia,” “Planet Money” and the daily news show “Up First.” Likewise, public radio stations across the country produce a ton of great shows, like “Last Seen” by Boston’s WBUR and “Making Obama” by Chicago’s WBEZ, and large podcasting studios — Radiotopia, Gimlet Media, Maximum Fun — will give a range of solid choices with excellent production value. (We list some of our favorite shows below.)To mix in niche or offbeat podcasts with your brand-name shows, Mr. Quah of Hot Pod suggests going the old-fashioned route: word-of-mouth endorsements.“Find your local young person who listens to podcasts and get that person to cough up a few recommendations,” he said. “Part of the pleasure is combining your listening playlist with something everybody knows and loves — like “This American Life"" or something like it — with something that’s roughly edited, but feels specifically for you.”For him, that means hourslong shows on N.B.A. predictions. For James T. Green, a Brooklyn-based artist and audio producer, it means experimental audio like the work showcased on “Constellations,” a Canadian audio art podcast, and “The Black Guy Who Tips,” a comedy and current events talk show created by Charlotte, N.C., husband-and-wife pair Rod and Karen Morrow. Mr. Green has listened to the couple for years, ever since a dull desk job led him to search “black podcast” in the Apple podcast directory.“I listened to all the NPR standards, but I was really interested in hearing people like me,” he said. “I wanted to hear black voices.”For Kelly Moffitt, a producer with StoryCorps and the author of the newsletter “Flyover Podcast"" about shows made between coasts, she sees podcasts as a way to hear from people not represented in traditional media, particularly in rural areas. Some of her favorite shows are from Appalachia (“The Front Porch” from West Virginia Public Broadcasting) and Mississippi (“Gravy” produced by the Southern Foodways Alliance). Her advice for finding a great new show?Google “‘podcast’ along with the place you want to hear a podcast from,” she said.Ms. Gerber-Margie suggests looking at groups on Reddit and Facebook — such as Reddit’s podcast subreddit and the Facebook group Podcasts We Listen To — for recommendations from ordinary people “who just want something to listen to on their commute,” she said. Another option: Join The New York Times’s Podcast Club on Facebook for discussions and recommendations.Think about what type of mood you’ll be in when you listen and how much time you have, Mr. Avirgan, of 30 for 30, said, adding that when his commute doubled to 40 minutes his podcast diet completely changed. Above all, he said, “it should not feel like work.”“That’s not to say that you’re not going to listen to things that feel serious and important,” he said. “But it always needs to be, at its base level, compelling.”More recommendations to get you startedNicholas QuahRecommendation: Weird podcastingExample: “Everything is Alive,"" a podcast of interviews with inanimate objects that falls somewhere between fiction and philosophy, and “Sleep With Me,” a stream-of-consciousness podcast that aims to help its listeners fall asleep.James T. GreenRecommendation: Start with a great episode, not a whole showExample: Unsure if Radiolab is for you? Green fell in love with the show years ago while listening to their classic episode, “Loops” on an hourslong road trip. Not sure if you want to hear every episode of The Nod? Start with their oral history of the song “Knuck If You Buck.” “It’s kind of like hearing a good single and then you want to hear the album,” he said.Kelly MoffittRecommendation: Community-produced showsExample: “For a Bad Time Call"" in which women call in and leave voice mail messages about their rage, produced in Columbus, Ohio, or “Wet Mountain Valley Dry Goods,” a collection of interviews with every resident in a small town of Westcliffe, Colorado.Dana Gerber-MargieRecommendation: Shows that make sense of the worldExample: Among her favorite first podcasts were “Freakonomics” and “Marketplace,” which she began listening to soon after hearing the seminal This American Life series about the 2008 financial crash, “The Giant Pool of Money.”Jody AvirganRecommendation: Classic interviews, or “two people talking”Example: This could be Terry Gross interviewing someone fascinating on “Fresh Air” (one of Mr. Avirgan’s favorite shows) or chatter between two hosts with “an absurd level of chemistry,” like Roger Bennett and Michael Davies of the soccer podcast “Men in Blazers.”Rachel Holliday Smith, your new guide to podcastsRecommendation: Anything that’s not newsExample: I listen to podcasts to escape the news cycle, not catch up on it. Favorite shows include the delightful pseudo-celebrity-obsessed podcast “Who? Weekly"" (tagline: “Everything you need to know about the celebrities you don’t.”) and “Ear Hustle,” a podcast about life inside San Quentin State Prison made by inmates who live there."
5c503a773a125f5075c06dbe,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/dealbook/huawei-criminal-charges-trade-secrets.html,"Good Tuesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.U.S. charges Huawei with theft and sanctions evasionThe Justice Department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the Chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets, evade economic sanctions on Iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior.The context: The charges come as officials from Beijing and Washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the Trump administration tries to shoulder Huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China’s industry and information technology ministry called them “unfair and immoral.”The allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington’s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Throwing a wrench into trade talks with ChinaThe Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been “significant movement” on talks that involved “very complicated issues,” including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices. Yesterday, the chip maker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in China.As Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division, notes:“The damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump’s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.”ImageA section of border wall being built in the U.S. near Tijuana, Mexico.CreditScott Olson/Getty ImagesThe aftershocks of the shutdownThe five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of it permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.That’s nearly double the $5.7 billion President Trump is seeking for a southern border wall — a project he still wants and is still threatening to shut down the government to get.The damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay, but with the government only funded for three weeks, many federal employees plan to hold off on spending.Here’s another wrinkle: Government statisticians just now returning to work are behind on collecting and analyzing figures on retail sales, manufacturing data, housing statistics and other information. Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz defends his plan to run as an independentHoward Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump’s chances for re-election.“Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,” Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the “guts” to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called “childish.” Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: “Don’t help elect Trump,” yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, “Health care is a human right.”More: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz’s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Ghosn’s plight reveals a pattern in JapanCarlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request. His predicament has turned a spotlight on the Japanese criminal justice system, writes the NYT’s Motoko Rich:The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.Some in the West have reacted strongly to the power that prosecutors have wielded. “This is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,” one critic wrote.Revolving DoorBlackBerry named Bryan Palma, a senior vice president at Cisco, as its chief operating officer and president.

5cab264949f0eacbf1f81932,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/business/dealbook/tech-unicorn-ipo.html,"Good Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)Pinterest’s modest I.P.O. valuation should worry other unicornsThe digital pin board company disclosed today that its I.P.O. would value it at less than its last private fund-raising round. That’s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year.The high range of Pinterest’s I.P.O. would value it at $11.3 billion, below the $12 billion attained from private investors two years ago. In Silicon Valley speak, that’s a “down round” — something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence.Coupled with early volatility in Lyft’s first days of trading, the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start-ups, especially given that many won’t turn a profit for years.It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public, including Uber (whose I.P.O. was expected to give a valuation as high as $120 billion), the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty.But there’s some reason not to panic yet. After initially falling below their I.P.O. price, Lyft shares bounced back. Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds: For instance, the file-sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I.P.O. And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show.More I.P.O. news: Though many investors are betting against Lyft’s newly public stock, the high-profile short seller Andrew Left isn’t among them. ImageRay DalioCreditBrian Snyder/ReutersHow Ray Dalio would fix capitalismThe Bridgewater Associates founder argued last week that capitalism “needs to be reformed.” Now he has outlined how he would do it:Declare the wealth and opportunity gaps a national emergency. “I have a principle that you will not effect change unless you affect the people who have their hands on the levers of power so that they move them to change things the way you want them to change,” he writes.Devise clear metrics for success. “I’d bring that sort of accountability down to the individual level to encourage an accountability culture in which individuals are aware of whether they are net contributors or net detractors to the society, and the individuals and the society make attempts to make them net contributors.”Redistribute resources to eliminate disparities. Mr. Dalio’s personal recommendations include:• Creating private-public partnerships that would vet and invest in projects that produce both social and economic returns.• Raise taxes on pollution and other causes of bad health.• Impose targeted tax increases on the wealthiest to pay for social welfare programs to bolster economic productivity.Better coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, so that more money ends up in the hands of people who will spend it (the lower and middle classes) as opposed to saving it (the wealthy).ImageA Facebook ad in London.CreditHenry Nicholls/ReutersBritain’s plan to police the internetThe British government has proposed sweeping new powers to regulate harmful content and false information, recommending one of the world’s most aggressive actions to police the internet, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.• A regulator would be given the power to “issue fines, block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms.”• Terrorism, inciting violence, encouraging suicide, spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address. The rules would apply to social media platforms, discussion forums, messaging services and search engines.• Facebook and Twitter will work with the government, representatives from the companies said.“Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet. Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication,” Mr. Satariano writes. But governments have become more willing to intervene “as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real-life consequences by contributing to violence, compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies.”“In the United States, where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations, there’s been less momentum to regulate internet content,” Mr. Satariano adds. But even in America, there is increasing support for new rules.Why you don’t want a partisan FedPresident Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore — two vocal supporters of his policies — to the Federal Reserve board. Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank. Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would mean.Historically, Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussions.Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain wouldn’t change much at first. They’d hold two of 12 votes on the Fed’s Open Market Committee, so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilities.But over time, the Fed could lose credibility. “The United States’ role as the global reserve currency — which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight — is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades,” Mr. Irwin writes.The financial world is watching closely. “I think it’s a very big benefit to the U.S. economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed, and I hope that continues,” Ed Keon, the chief investment strategist at QMA, told CNBC.ImageCarlos GhosnCreditKazuhiro Nogi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCarlos Ghosn is ousted from Nissan’s boardNissan shareholders voted today to remove their former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from the board altogether, the WSJ reports.• “Much of the meeting was devoted to questions from angry shareholders, with many demanding Nissan executives step down for failing to find alleged wrongdoing.”• “In response to a shareholder who accused Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa of failing to take responsibility for any of the alleged wrongdoing, Mr. Saikawa said: ‘I never said we didn’t have responsibility. The problem built up over 20 years, and we cannot correct it overnight.’ ”Mr. Ghosn will be replaced by Renault’s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard. Greg Kelly, who is accused of abetting inaccurate disclosure of Mr. Ghosn’s compensation, was also voted off the board.More: Mr. Ghosn’s wife has appealed to the French government to help her husband.Time is running out of time for a Brexit compromisePrime Minister Theresa May sought to rekindle cross-party talks about her Brexit deal yesterday, just days before Britain is due to leave the E.U. without a deal, Benjamin Mueller of the NYT reports:• Mrs. May is seeking a way to persuade members of the opposition Labour Party to back her deal.• But Labour leaders maintained on Sunday “that Mrs. May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal.”• “And whatever overtures she makes to Labour, analysts said, she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal — a major sticking point in the cross-party talks.”Mrs. May will try to get another extension from Brussels this week. What such a delay would look like is undecided: Mrs. May wants a simple extension, while the European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, wants something more flexible. Either way, it will require the support of all 27 E.U. leaders at a summit meeting on Wednesday.If she doesn’t get an extension, Britain may crash out of the E.U. without a deal — or remain in the political bloc.Revolving doorKirstjen Nielsen resigned as the secretary of homeland security yesterday.

5c2cd02e3a125f5075c02898,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/business/china-internet-censor.html,"Li Chengzhi had a lot to learn when he first got a job as a professional censor. Like many young people in China, the 24-year-old recent college graduate knew little about the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. He had never heard of China’s most famous dissident, Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in custody two years ago.Now, after training, he knows what to look for — and what to block. He spends his hours scanning online content on behalf of Chinese media companies looking for anything that will provoke the government’s wrath. He knows how to spot code words that obliquely refer to Chinese leaders and scandals, or the memes that touch on subjects the Chinese government doesn’t want people to read about.Mr. Li, who still has traces of youthful acne on his face, takes his job seriously. “It helps cleanse the online environment,” he said. For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. That in turn has created a growing and lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Mr. Li works for Beyondsoft, a Beijing-based tech services company that, among other businesses, takes on the censorship burden for other companies. He works in its office in the city of Chengdu. In the heart of a high-tech industrial area, the space is bright and new enough that it resembles the offices of well-funded start-ups in tech centers like Beijing and Shenzhen. It recently moved to the space because customers complained that its previous office was too cramped to allow employees to do their best work.“Missing one beat could cause a serious political mistake,” said Yang Xiao, head of Beyondsoft’s internet service business, including content reviewing. (Beyondsoft declined to disclose which Chinese media or online companies it works for, citing confidentiality.)China has built the world’s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party’s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe. Once circumspect about its controls, China now preaches a vision of a government-supervised internet that has surprising resonance in other countries. Even traditional bastions of free expression like Western Europe and the United States are considering their own digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more people to better keep a handle on their content. Workers like Mr. Li show the extremes of that approach — one that controls what more than 800 million internet users in China see every day.Beyondsoft employs over 4,000 workers like Mr. Li at its content reviewing factories. That is up from about 200 in 2016. They review and censor content day and night.“We’re the Foxconn in the data industry,” said Mr. Yang, comparing his firm to the biggest contract manufacturer that makes iPhones and other products for Apple.Many online media companies have their own internal content review teams, sometimes numbering in the thousands. They are exploring ways to get artificial intelligence to do the work. The head of the A.I. lab at a major online media company, who asked for anonymity because the subject is sensitive, said the company had 120 machine learning models. But success is spotty. Users can easily fool algorithms. “The A.I. machines are intelligent, but they aren’t as clever as human brains,” Mr. Li said. “They miss a lot of things when reviewing content.”Beyondsoft has a team of 160 people in Chengdu working four shifts a day to review potentially politically sensitive content on a news aggregating app. For the same app, Beyondsoft has another team in the western city of Xi’an reviewing potentially vulgar or profane content. Like the rest of the world, China’s internet is rife with pornography and other material that many users might find offensive. In the Chengdu office, workers must put their smartphones in hallway lockers. They can’t take screenshots or send any information from their computers.The workers are almost all college graduates in their 20s. They are often unaware of, or indifferent to, politics. In China, many parents and teachers tell the young that caring about politics leads only to trouble.To overcome that, Mr. Yang and his colleagues developed a sophisticated training system. New hires start with weeklong “theory” training, during which senior employees teach them the sensitive information that they didn’t know before. “My office is next to the big training room,” Mr. Yang said. “I often hear the surprised sounds of ‘Ah, ah, ah.’” “They didn’t know things like June 4,” he added, referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. “They really didn’t know.”Beyondsoft has developed an extensive database based on such information that Mr. Yang calls one of its “core competencies.” It also uses anti-censorship software to regularly visit what it calls anti-revolutionary websites that are blocked by the Chinese government. It then updates the database.New employees study the database much like preparing for college entrance exams. After two weeks, they have to pass a test.The screen saver on each computer is the same: photos and names of current and past members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top leadership. Workers must memorize those faces: Only government-owned websites and specially approved political blogs — a group on what’s called a whitelist — are allowed to post photos of top leaders.Workers are briefed at the beginning of their shift on the newest censoring instructions sent by clients, which the clients themselves receive from government censors. Workers then must answer about 10 questions designed to test their memory. The results of the exam affect the workers’ pay.One question on a recent Friday: Which one of the following names is the daughter of Li Peng, China’s former premier? The correct answer is Li Xiaolin, a longtime target of online ridicule for her expensive fashion taste and for being one of many children of senior officials who come into high positions or wealth. That’s a relatively easy one. A tougher test is parsing the roundabout ways that China’s internet users evade stringent censorship to talk about current affairs. Take, for example, a Hong Kong news site’s 2017 commentary that compared the six Chinese leaders since Mao Zedong to emperors during the Han dynasty. Some Chinese users started using the emperors’ names when referring to the leaders. Beyondsoft’s workers have to know which emperor’s name is associated with which leader. Then there are the photos of an empty chair. They refer to Mr. Liu, the Nobel laureate, who wasn’t allowed to leave China to attend the award ceremony and was represented by an empty chair. References to George Orwell’s novel “1984” are also forbidden. Beyondsoft’s software trawls through web pages and marks potentially offensive words in different colors. If a page is full of color-coded words, it usually requires a closer look, according to the executives. If there are only one or two, it’s pretty safe to let it pass.According to Beyondsoft’s website, its content monitoring service, called Rainbow Shield, has compiled over 100,000 basic sensitive words and over three million derivative words. Politically sensitive words make up one-third of the total, followed by words related to pornography, prostitution, gambling and knives.Workers like Mr. Li make $350 to $500 a month, about average pay in Chengdu. Each worker is expected to review 1,000 to 2,000 articles during a shift. Articles uploaded to the news app must be approved or rejected within an hour. Unlike Foxconn workers, they don’t work much overtime because longer hours could hurt accuracy, said Mr. Yang, the executive.It’s easy to make mistakes. One article about Peng Liyuan, China’s first lady, mistakenly used the photo of a famous singer rumored to be linked to another leader. It was caught by someone else before it went out, Mr. Yang said.Mr. Li, the young censor, said the worst mistakes were almost all related to senior leaders. He once missed a tiny photo of Mr. Xi on a website not on the whitelist because he was tired. He still kicks himself for it.When asked whether he had shared with family and friends what he learned at work, such as the Tiananmen crackdown, Mr. Li vehemently said no.“This information is not for people outside to know,” he said. “Once many people know about it, it could generate rumors.”But the crackdown was history. It wasn’t a rumor. How would he reconcile that? “For certain things,” he said, “one just has to obey the rules.”"
5c2bb1353a125f5075c02768,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/business/timber-wood-construction-real-estate.html,"Developers have not used wood for much other than houses since the horse-and-buggy days. But the knotty building material is making a comeback.Seeking greener projects, which many consumers continue to embrace despite an anti-environmental mood in Washington, builders are choosing timber for offices, apartments and campus buildings, rather than the concrete and steel that dominated construction for decades.Not everybody is on board with the trend, which is playing out from coast to coast. Concerns persist about wood’s flame resistance and strength, as well as its cost, which can be 30 percent more than traditional materials.But proponents scored a huge win last month when the International Code Council, an influential advisory group in Washington, concluded that some wooden buildings could climb as high as 18 stories, more than twice the current permissible height, without compromising safety.Consumers have already shown interest.“The connections people have with wood cannot be underestimated,” said Tim Gokhman, the director of New Land Enterprises, which is behind two projects in Milwaukee that are mostly made of wood. One is a seven-story office building. The other is Ascent, a 201-unit luxury rental tower that, at 21 stories, would be the tallest timber building in the Western Hemisphere. Both await approvals — including permission to exceed height restrictions, which developers say will not pose any danger — but expect to break ground this year.Unlike the production of concrete and steel, which generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the creation of lumber is a relatively low-pollution process, Mr. Gokhman said.Trees are also an easily renewable resource, achieving nearly their full size in a decade, according to Jason Korb, an architect and a designer of both New Land projects. He added that the United States had some catching up to do, as wooden towers exist or are underway in Australia, Austria, Canada and Norway, among other places.“It’s really starting to come into its own around the world right now,” Mr. Korb said.For those who expect wooden buildings to resemble log cabins, the current crop may come as a surprise.ImageAn office building made with nailed wood in Brooklyn. City codes limit timber buildings to seven stories.CreditJohn Muggenborg for The New York TimesMost have metal or brick facades, a stipulation of building codes focused on fire restrictions, which means the buildings often do not stand out from the outside. Inside, though, gently striated lumber surfaces are on full display, as they are at Carbon12, an eight-story, 14-unit condominium in Portland, Ore., currently the country’s tallest wood structure.In fact, there is so much exposed and unpainted wood, in columns, beams and ceilings, it gives the condos the appearance of a construction zone. Half the condos, which range from $800,000 to $1.3 million, have sold since the building opened last spring, said Ben Kaiser, the developer.Mr. Kaiser faced challenges getting Carbon12 built. The permitting process took almost two years to wind through city and state agencies, largely because wood buildings in Oregon could top out at no more than six stories, he said.In the end, officials concluded that wooden high-rises could help revive Oregon’s stagnant timber industry, Mr. Kaiser said. In August, the state increased the height limit to 18 stories.Carbon12’s timber, however, did not come cheap, according to Mr. Kaiser, whose  offices were also built with timber. Indeed, at $11 million, Carbon12 was about 20 percent more expensive to construct than a concrete version would have been, which in some ways dictated that it be a luxury condo.“It’s like anything — the first iPhone, the first flat-screen TV,” Mr. Kaiser said. “Costs are high because not enough people are doing it.”Nevertheless, he plans to use wood from now on. In addition to their green benefits, he said, wood buildings perform well in earthquakes because of their lighter weight and flexibility.Proponents of wood must still overcome a longstanding bias. In the 1800s, fires were a scourge, prompting restrictions on wood. But steel is not infallible and can buckle in extreme heat, said John Peronto, a principal at the engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti who is involved in the two Milwaukee projects.“But we’ve gotten comfortable using steel and concrete products, so the question’s been, ‘Why would we change?’” he said.Still, wood is not what it used to be. The decline in old-growth forests means developers can no longer count on huge single trunks to support floors. Instead, they rely on mass timber, an engineered product made of layers of spruce or fir pressed together in a way that is similar to plywood but with a more elegant look.Nail-laminated timber fortifies T3, a three-year-old, seven-story office building in Minneapolis’s North Loop neighborhood. Eighty-two percent of the steel-clad building, whose name is shorthand for “timber, technology and transit,” is leased to tenants like Amazon, which occupies three floors. Asking rents are about $23 a square foot, said David Schreiber, a managing director at LaSalle Investment Management, the landlord.Also leasing space there is Industrious, a co-working provider, which had to spend about 15 percent more than usual to add conference rooms and private offices to its floor, said Jamie Hodari, a company co-founder. Industrious had to route cables to avoid damaging the wood, he said.But the investment appears worthwhile. T3 is far more popular among workers than Industrious’s other Minneapolis outpost, in a glassy modern high-rise, Mr. Hodari said.“It’s almost like walking into a Swedish sauna,” he said. “It’s incredibly beautiful.”Hines, the real estate investment firm that developed T3, took inspiration from a nearby office building it owns, which began life as a 19th-century warehouse. Despite robust demand, the brick-and-timber edifice had high turnover because it lacked contemporary finishes like soundproofing, said Steve Luthman, a Hines senior managing director. T3 kept its natural aesthetic, but Hines added touches like airtight windows and a modern heating system.Hines is taking T3 nationwide to cities like Atlanta, where a seven-story, 250,000-square-foot offering, developed with Invesco Real Estate, will open in West Midtown this summer.Denver and Chicago will get similar towers, which may be less expensive to construct than their predecessors. Wood remains expensive, but the assembly-line aspect of mass-timber production, in which factories make large panels, then assemble them on-site, saves time and labor costs.ImageFlank used nailed wood instead of cross-laminated timber out of worries that its buildings might not be approved.CreditJohn Muggenborg for The New York Times“I think it works out to about the same,” Mr. Luthman said.For all the recent headway, there have been stumbles.In March, a 1,000-pound section of floor gave way at a mass-timber building under construction at Oregon State University. The floor was made of a relatively new product, cross-laminated timber, in which layers of wood are glued at right angles to each other. And two of the seven layers broke loose, said Steven Clark, a university spokesman.“I think it had a quieting effect on the market,” he said. “People began to ask questions.”But after a four-month hiatus, construction of the $80 million building, Peavy Hall, resumed and is expected to be completed this year.Winning acceptance for mass timber seems especially challenging in New York, which appears to have lagged other cities in proposals. But a handful of projects are underway in Brooklyn, including a pair of office buildings in Williamsburg from the firm Flank.Those buildings, at three and five stories, conform to city codes, which limit timber buildings to seven stories. But the developer shied from cross-laminated timber because of worries that the buildings might not be approved. Flank went with nailed wood instead.“It’s hard to try new things here,” said Mick Walsdorf, a Flank managing partner.Because land is so expensive in New York, a short building can be unrealistic, developers say. Indeed, the height limit frustrated Jeff Spiritos, a developer who sought to build a 10-story timber condo near Manhattan’s High Line but withdrew the plan after two years of discussions.A former Hines executive, Mr. Spiritos is looking to put up wooden multifamily structures outside the city, like in New Haven. But New York may soon be more appealing, because of that December vote by the International Code Council.Any change to New York’s building code, which the City Council would need to ratify, could take years. But Mr. Spiritos called it “humongous” news all the same.“I feel so strongly about the environmental imperative of changing the way we build,” he added, “for the health of the planet.”"
5c2c7d9a3a125f5075c02819,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/arts/oscars-movies-best-of-2108-black-panther.html,"Having wrapped up their reviewing duties for 2018, our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, look back at a year of rage, silliness and sublimity at the movies and ahead to the 91st Academy Awards.A. O. SCOTT If I had to pick one movie moment to sum up 2018, it would probably be the last scene of “Support the Girls,” Andrew Bujalski’s workplace comedy about the manager of a Hooters-like bar and grill in Texas. Not enough people paid attention when the film was released in August, but Regina Hall’s performance has picked up some awards and nominations since then, and everyone should stream it right now.Anyway: The movie ends with three women — Hall, Haley Lu Richardson and Shayna McHayle — screaming on a roof. Not in terror (as women onscreen so often do), but in rage, frustration and a kind of righteous, rebellious glee. They are venting and protesting, having endured an endless cycle of everyday racism, sexism and exploitation. As an ending, it feels triumphant and bleak at the same time, which may be why I keep coming back to it.MANOHLA DARGIS I was up on that roof, at least in spirit. In some ways, this sisterly scream is the signature image for the past year. Scarcely a week (a day!) went by without a powerful man being called out for his alleged sexual misconduct, most publicly of course during the fraught Brett Kavanaugh nomination hearings. At the same time that we were witnessing this profound reckoning, we were also seeing a number of female-driven movies, most of which — it’s important to recognize — had finished shooting before news of the sexual harassment accusations against Harvey Weinstein broke in October 2017.Oddly, when I watched the roof interlude in “Support the Girls” I flashed on the scene in Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Last Tango in Paris” of Marlon Brando screaming — he’s cursing God — under a thundering overhead train. Bertolucci died in November, and his artistic legacy is forever linked, and rightly so, to allegations of abuse from that film’s co-star, Maria Schneider. In 2007, she said that while shooting its most infamous sex scene she felt humiliated and “a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci.” The allegations feel emblematic of the destructive power imbalance in an industry that has marginalized and victimized women while giving free license to male abuse.No wonder women are yelling.ImageIf one movie moment summed up 2018, it would be the sisterly scream by, from left, Haley Lu Richardson, Regina Hall and Shayna McHayle at the end of “Support the Girls.”CreditMagnolia PicturesSCOTT A few years ago you and I examined the state of female representation in movies, and found that it was improving, meaning that a wider range of roles seemed to be opening up. But in retrospect a lot of those roles — the varieties of strong, raunchy and badass comic and action heroines who emerged in the early and middle part of this decade — look like they were designed to deflect criticism or prove a narrow point: that girls could be just as tough, violent, brave or naughty as boys. This boldness was accompanied by a certain anxiety about losing the male audience, anticipating the tantrums that would later be thrown by some fragile “Ghostbusters” and “Star Wars” fans.[ Want help figuring out where to stream the best movies of the year? Subscribe to the Times’s Watching newsletter. ]In some ways, things haven’t changed so much. In a recent essay in Buzzfeed, Alison Willmore notes that “2018 has been as rich with slogany, simplified women’s empowerment callouts as it has been with reasons for women to be filled with rage and dread.” She singles out “On the Basis of Sex,” Mimi Leder’s film about Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s early career, and “Ocean’s 8,” Gary Ross’s #squadgoals heist picture with a cast including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling and Rihanna.But the careful, superficial conventionality of those movies highlights the complexity of so many others. It’s worth listing some of them, just as a reminder of how much feminist argument there has been in and about movies this year — how central the questions of women’s anger, power and autonomy have been in popular culture and politics more generally. In no particular order, and in addition to the ones we’ve already named, I would mention “Revenge,” “Widows,” “The Favourite,” “The Wife,” “Suspiria,” “Destroyer,” “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Roma,” “Eighth Grade,” “A Wrinkle in Time,” “Madeline’s Madeline,” “Let the Sunshine In” and “A Simple Favor.” It’s not that all of them offer equally plausible or positive images — they’re not all good movies! — but that filmmakers seem interested in the politics of women’s experiences in a way that feels different. One measure of the difference is that for the first time in I don’t know how many years the field of potential Oscar best actress nominees looks much wider and more interesting than the potential best actors.ImageSome films positing female empowerment, like “Ocean’s 8” (starring, from left, Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett and Awkwafina), trafficked in careful, superficial conventionality.CreditBarry Wetcher/Warner Bros., via Associated PressDARGIS It’s great to see so many female-driven stories, though — as you say — not all are good or feminist. “Widows” and “Ocean’s 8” put a spurious sisterly spin on old-fashioned American greed. Both would have been better and more honest if their characters were just as openly mercenary as any male movie thief and didn’t try to soften these women’s crimes with tears and rationalizations. By contrast, because “Support the Girls” leads with the lived-in, different truths of its characters, its feminism is organic, not performative or programmatic. “Roma” focuses on one woman, but, unlike most American movies, also looks at that life in the larger world of structural oppression.Taken together, all these movies — the good, the bad, the blah — are welcome just because they offer an actual range of different female roles and diverse ideas about women’s place in the world. Some of these ideas are stale and the moviemaking is dreary or worse, but I’m glad they exist. A movie like “The Wife,” for instance, is so devoid of aesthetic interest that the only thing we can discuss is how it frames power and gender while letting its title character — who has been long complicit in her husband’s literary fraud and his exploitation of her — off the hook.“The Wife” is calibrated for maximum audience flattery: viewers are encouraged to nod in recognition at the literary milieu and clap their hands in self-congratulatory glee at the husband’s fall. Men, bad; women, good — its feminism is irritatingly reductive, but it does make the movie topical fodder especially in 2018, a year that has reminded us that feminism speaks in many different voices. Some of these voices are radical and forward-thinking while others seem discouragingly stuck in the same era as, well, “Green Book,” yet another movie that seems mostly interested in making its audience — here, presumptively white — feel good about its own racial sensitivities.SCOTT I love that “The Wife,” most of which takes place in Stockholm during the Nobel Prize ceremonies, was released shortly before the Swedish Academy canceled the literature prize because of a sexual harassment scandal. I hope someone has optioned that kerfuffle — which is too baroque and weird to summarize — for a movie. Maybe Yorgos Lanthimos, fresh off the power games of “The Favourite.”ImageFilms like “Sorry to Bother You,” starring Tessa Thompson and Lakeith Stanfield, had more on their minds than comforting fables of finger-lickin’ harmony.CreditAnnapurna PicturesAh yes, “Green Book.” It’s sort of mind-boggling that Peter Farrelly’s compendium of tone-deaf racial clichés arrived on screens in the same year as “Sorry to Bother You,” “BlacKkKlansman” and “If Beale Street Could Talk.” It seems to come not only from a bygone era but from a whole different cinema planet, one governed by feel-good pieties that were dubious here on earth even back in the 1960s. The voting membership of the Academy circa 1987 would have given all the prizes to “Green Book,” but in 2019 its prospects are decidedly cloudier.Not that Boots Riley, Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins represent a unified perspective on black life and American racism, or that they are in perfect political and imaginative harmony with one another. Hardly, and thank goodness. But all of them are interested in offering something other than comforting fables of finger-lickin’ harmony. And even though “Beale Street” and “BlacKkKlansman” are set in the ‘70s, while “Sorry” unfolds in a speculative near-future, each one explicitly addresses the unfinished business of the present.Which is what I want: movies that, rather than arriving at pat or reassuring conclusions, embrace the complications of reality and invite the audience to really think about it. Mostly this year I found that in documentaries and in other movies made at some distance from the American commercial mainstream.DARGIS At this point it feels as if the remaining big studios have nothing to offer other than recycled ideas and brands, with some exceptions. I like some of the box office behemoths — mostly, I like “Black Panther” — but too many of them were numbingly familiar in every way, narratively, tonally, whatever. This isn’t new or news, but it’s bleak that “Avengers: Infinity War” receives attention simply because it is from Marvel. Each of its movies is just a delivery system for that brand, though this one did encourage me with the promise that its characters and this franchise are finally goners.Disney has been the dominant player for a while and, as its power has grown, each of its new movies feels like a product launch: The release of the new Marvel, Star Wars or Pixar movie is greeted like the release of the latest iPhone, including the rabid-dog media attention it generates. There are modifications, some nifty new features, but it’s mostly the same, just pricier. This seems like how things worked in classic Hollywood cinema, which depended on both standardization (through product quality control and storytelling norms, for instance) and differentiation (in the diversity of films and stars and so on).The current big-studio model, though, is more focused on sameness than difference. Each new addition to the franchise can’t be meaningfully different enough to mess with the brand. That’s partly what makes “Black Panther” interesting: It doesn’t just swap out one Chris for another (Chris Hemsworth’s Thor instead of Chris Evans’s Captain America). It introduces ideas and characters that are so strong, so in excess of what we normally see — African-American identity, Afro-futurism, Michael B. Jordan’s performance and the very figure of Killmonger — that they become bigger and more important than the Marvel brand and story beats.Image“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” brought an ingenious, unforced pluralism to the Peter Parker mythos.CreditSony Pictures AnimationSCOTT It turns out that when “diversity” means something more than pandering or tokenism — when, as in the case of “Black Panther,” an African-American filmmaker can claim the freedom to explore the cultural and political valences of an African superhero — a worked-over franchise can be revivified. That’s what Ryan Coogler did to the Marvel Universe. (He’d already done it to the “Rocky” cosmos with “Creed,” which he bequeathed to his fellow U.S.C. alum Steven Caple, Jr.)Something similar happened, on a more modest scale and with a more playful sensibility, in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” which brought an ingenious, unforced pluralism to the Peter Parker mythos. What if the radioactive spider happened to bite the Afro-Latino son of a police officer and a health care worker? It’s a fascinating question if the answer is handled with appropriate wit and authenticity, as it was by the gang at Sony Pictures Animation.Marvel Comics has been exploring these kinds of stories for a while, steadily eroding the white-male monopoly on superhero status in print. I’m glad the movie’s incarnations of those stories are starting to follow suit (and not only in the Marvel universe, to be fair). My political quarrel with “Black Panther” — wait, where are you going? — has to do with its commitment to monarchism and to Wakanda’s appropriation of Silicon Valley techno-neoliberalism as its guiding ideology. Superheroism remains a profoundly anti-democratic undertaking. I wish the great Senegalese filmmaker (and novelist, labor organizer and political gadfly) Ousmane Sembène were still around, so he could take up the next chapter in the franchise. Or maybe Disney would hire Raoul Peck (“Lumumba,” “I Am Not Your Negro”) or Abderrahmane Sissako (“Bamako,” “Timbuktu”) to direct a stand-alone Killmonger adventure, one that rescues that misunderstood villain from the condescension of comic-book history. The next phase of the dialectic is surely the synthesis of Marvel and Marx.A fellow can dream, anyway.DARGIS Keep dreaming, and I mean that in the nicest way, comrade. That “Black Panther” inspires such reveries — and indeed was one of the most exciting, idea-generating movies of the year — is further proof that its differences are profound, even if it is another male-driven heroic tale. It’s the kind of big-studio release that makes me think that the world of American industrial moviemaking isn’t a creative wasteland. Its impact even makes me look forward to the next Oscars. (Not really.)"
5c4052323a125f5075c04e06,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/design/national-parks-ansel-adams-photography.html,"BOSTON — Ah, wilderness! It’s our answer to Europe’s cathedrals, our proof of a unique national identity. Most citizens were first introduced to the wilderness by images. In the early 19th century, Thomas Cole placed the eastern wilderness — his beloved Catskill Mountains — on walls. Later in the century, Carleton Watkins’s 1861 photographs of Yosemite contributed heavily to Lincoln’s decision in 1864 to secure the valley forever “for public use, resort and recreation,” the first time any government anywhere set aside land to benefit the public. William Henry Jackson’s 1871 photographs of Yellowstone helped persuade Congress to establish the first national park in 1872. Then in the 1930s, Ansel Adams (1902-1984), a staunch conservationist who had grown up near the windswept dunes of Golden Gate Park, lobbied Congress and sent the government a book of his photographs of the southern Sierra Nevada range. They strongly influenced President Franklin Roosevelt’s decision to make the Kings Canyon area a national park. Late in the 19th century virtually every home had a viewer for 3-D stereographs of a West that looked like a fable. Manifestly — in mind-set as well as mission — the West was our destiny.And now it is bracing — if perhaps cautionary — to see, close to the moment that the government shutdown has affected many of the national parks, so many noble and challenging images of our country’s heritage starring in “Ansel Adams in Our Time,” at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It is a far-ranging, smartly and instructively installed show of more than 100 of his photographs. Not a mere retrospective, it also includes about 80 images by 23 contemporary photographers that the curator, Karen Haas, sees as a modern lens on Adams. Although the connections are occasionally a bit tenuous, their addition highlights how Adams, who carried the 19th century’s hymn to America into the 20th century, has remained an inescapable force.The photographers on view who adapt Adams’s images simultaneously make radical changes and commentaries. Their inclusion points out major shifts in the way both landscape photography and landscape itself are now regarded.Image“Monolith — The Face of Half Dome, Yosemite National Park,” Ansel Adams, 1927.CreditThe Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, via Museum of Fine Arts, BostonImage“Sand Dunes, Sunrise, Death Valley National Monument, California,” by Ansel Adams. Negative date, about 1948.CreditThe Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, via Museum of Fine Arts, BostonAlthough Adams gave his heart to the 19th century, he trained his eye on modernism and the “straight photography” of the 1930s, with its sharp focus, vivid contrast and compositions that amounted to studies in form and light. His iconic and still breathtaking mountainscapes of Yosemite and elsewhere are on view, as well as such semiabstract landscapes as “Sand Dunes, Sunrise, Death Valley National Monument, California,” which could stand comfortably beside an Edward Weston. Most come from the Lane Collection, a munificent gift of more than 450 Adams photographs to the M.F.A. There are surprises too, like the breadth of Adams’s interests (and the extent of his need to earn a living with commissions and magazine work), from Native Americans to ghost towns, from a World War II Japanese internment camp to cemeteries, churches, a cigar store Indian, a highway interchange.Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Adams experienced a heightened spirituality in the wilderness that spoke to a longing for the beauties, peace and spectacle of untrammeled nature — a yearning that lingers strongly in our time, suggesting it might be innate. He was 14 when he first visited Yosemite. He quickly took his Kodak into that stupendous valley and was so moved by the experience that it changed his life. Adams meant his images to convey the emotions he experienced while taking pictures and then heightening their impact in the darkroom. (He was a superb printer.) How lucky it is for the arts that human vision, though it does not register the world in black and white, can respond to colorless representation on a level within reach of its response to color.Landscape tourism grew exponentially from the post Civil War years to today, but untouched wilderness has dwindled as the population increased and migrated to cities and suburbs, while mining, drilling and industrialization encroached on open spaces. Adams, though well aware of how commercialized the national parks had become, could scarcely have anticipated that on summer weekends the grounds bordering the Grand Canyon would look like Woodstock. He preferred the parks pristine, and Eadweard J. Muybridge’s 19th-century photograph of Yosemite Valley with a logging road cutting across it is paired at the M.F.A. with Adams’s image of the same place, the road carefully retouched out.Photographers took note of how “progress” had changed the land. In the 1960s and 1970s, the movement called New Topographics signaled a radical shift from traditional depictions of the land to the many ways we had altered it.Image“The Tetons and Snake River, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming,” by Ansel Adams, 1942.CreditThe Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, via Museum of Fine Arts, BostonImage“Cemetery Statue and Oil Derricks, Long Beach, California,” by Ansel Adams, who in 1939 took note of how “progress” was changing the landscape.CreditThe Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, via Museum of Fine Arts, BostonRobert Adams, Lewis Baltz and others photographed what had once been purple mountains’ majesty — mountains now more likely to tower above rutted lanes and ticky-tacky houses. Adams took some note as well. His photograph of a housing development is at the M.F.A., as is his picture of a pensive cemetery statue that makes it clear that the cemetery borders on a forest — of oil derricks.The New Topographers were determined to acknowledge the slow decline of wilderness, which had been trampled in part by the lingering wish to be near nature, a wish that bit its own tail. Many of the houses destroyed by the recent Northern California fires were located in what’s called the wildland-urban interface, dangerously close to forests. In the late 1970s, a group called the Rephotographic Project figured out exactly where and in what season some important 19th-century landscape photographers had stood, then made photographs at the exact same times and places. The landscape, often enough, was quite recognizable but equally often overrun or partially obstructed by buildings.Nonetheless, art and commercial photographers today still photograph beautiful landscapes beautifully. Landscape photographs are everywhere, thanks to Instagram, providing proof that wilderness still exists, although it may be outnumbered by its portraits.SOME CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHERS ask a vital question of art history: What can be done with a scene that long ago became an icon and is tattooed upon our minds? The answer lies with what artists have done with icons for centuries: They have reinterpreted them.Mark Klett and Byron Wolfe incorporated pieces of earlier photographs into their own collaboration on exhibit here, stitching a time sequence into a single image. They photographed the view from Glacier Point overlook at exactly the spot where Carleton Watkins had stood, then replaced portions of their color photograph with a fragment of Adams’s and a fragment of Watkins’s photographs of the same view.Catherine Opie takes highly colored, out-of-focus pictures of Adams’s territory in the national parks. In a video at the exhibition she said that she wants people to know what they are looking at but to question it, an act of witnessing that one click on an iPhone, one glance at social media, does not create.Image“Untitled #1 (Yosemite Valley),” by Catherine Opie, 2015 photograph, pigment print.CreditCatherine Opie, via Regen Projects and Lehmann Maupin; via Museum of Fine Arts, BostonImage“Tent-Camera Image on Ground: View of Mount Moran and the Snake River from Oxbow Bend, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming,” by Abelardo Morell, 2011 photograph, inkjet print.CreditMuseum of Fine Arts, BostonAbelardo Morell converted a dark, sealed tent into a camera obscura. An image of what an attached periscope saw was projected through its angled mirror onto the tent’s ground. He then photographed that underfoot image and printed it just as it was, showcasing America the beautiful through smatters and tatters of grass and dirt, as if the soles of our shoes had risen up to insist they were as essential to viewing as the view itself.Binh Danh took daguerreotypes of Yosemite, a reversal of time and history. Daguerreotypes, made without a negative, are unique. They were introduced in 1839, never widely used for landscapes, and largely replaced by a negative process by the time Watkins photographed Yosemite in 1861. Their surface is reflective, so Binh Danh’s viewers see themselves looking at images of iconic places that they themselves are in.Other contemporaries report on the many lasting changes human hands have made on the landscape. Mark Ruwedel photographs the tunnels and cuts that railroads long ago carved through the West at terrible cost and later abandoned — useless paths to nowhere slicing across the land.Image“Altamont Pass Wind Farm, California,” by Mitch Epstein, 2007 photograph, chromogenic print.CreditMuseum of Fine Arts, BostonMitch Epstein’s “Altamont Pass Wind Farm” suggests that human interference has reached an implausible level. The wind farm sits in a barren desert, but where the windmills end a glistening green golf course begins, equipped with a concrete lane for golf carts. Where did, where does, the water come from? And the dirt? It may be ironic to plunk an entire course down beside a sand trap, but the 19th-century idea that God meant us to tame and reconfigure the land for our use did not have this in mind.David Emitt Adams also photographs a deranged landscape, printing tintypes (another 19th-century process) of landscape details onto sculptures he made of old, beat-up, discarded metal cans he collected in the desert, where they pepper the ground. A new role for the desert: prime dump.Though Adams remains extravagantly popular and landscape photographers across America and the world continue to provide us with luscious images, probably the largest number of landscape photographs people see, on television, the web, on mobile and in newspapers, are images of environmental destruction that is at least partially due to climate change: flooded beaches, rivers, towns, and islands, shrinking glaciers, forest fires feeding on drought, hurricane damage of cities and fields. All scientific predictions say this will grow worse unless strong action is taken soon.Beautiful landscapes are good for the eye, the mind, the spirit. One day images of them may be all that we have left.Ansel Adams in Our TimeThrough Feb. 24 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; 617-267-9300, mfa.org.Related ExhibitionThrough March 3, the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., has on view “Contemplating the View: American Landscape Photographs,” an exceptional photography exhibition with examples of Adams’s work.Related CoverageWhat Is and Isn’t Affected by the Government ShutdownJan. 2, 2019His Three Loves: Photography, Art History and LisaNov. 5, 2018Dispatches From a Ruined ParadiseOct. 25, 2018What Adams Saw Through His LensApril 27, 2008Altered Visions and Changing VistasMarch 28, 2015"

Military officials at the time chose not to retaliate. Another angle: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, today to discuss several issues that have weakened the U.S.-Saudi alliance, including the war in Yemen.News analysis: The void left by America’s growing disengagement in the Middle East is being filled by Russia and Iran, our bureau chief in Beirut, Lebanon, writes.President Trump faces a growing political fightMichael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, is scheduled to testify publicly in Congress next month about his work for Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders of House committees warned the president on Sunday against trying to influence witnesses’ testimony. The Democrats’ warning capped a busy weekend: The Times learned that the F.B.I. investigated whether the president was secretly working on Russia’s behalf, and The Washington Post reported that the president tried to hide details of his conversations with President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump was asked in an interview on Fox News on Saturday whether he was working for Russia. “I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he answered. News analysis: “Mr. Trump faces the prospect of an all-out political war for survival,” our chief White House correspondent writes.What’s next: Confirmation hearings are set to begin on Tuesday for William Barr, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, who has a broad view of presidential power. Democrats have demanded that Mr. Barr protect the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference.

5c67ed8d3a125f5075c0a0d4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/style/plastic-free-living.html,"For Beth Terry, the epiphany came when she read an article about how albatross chicks are being killed by discarded plastics. It was time to banish plastic from her life.First, she focused on her kitchen and got rid of the shopping bags, microwaveable Stouffer’s macaroni and cheese, Clif energy bars and the prewashed salads in plastic tubs. Then she turned to her bathroom, where she switched to shampoo bars instead of bottles and made her own hair conditioner from apple cider vinegar. Toothpaste without plastic packaging was exceptionally hard to find, so she started making her own with baking soda.Sometimes her personal war on plastic created awkward moments. During a vacation to Disneyland in California to run a half-marathon, Ms. Terry and her husband left their reusable cloth bags in the hotel, soon discovering that the local supermarket only had plastic bags. How to carry a bunch of apples, oranges, avocados and melons?“We just rolled it up in our T-shirts and carried it that way,” said Ms. Terry, 54, recalling how she crab-walked back to the hotel to stay true to her principles. “If I let myself off the hook this time, it would be easier for me to take plastic next time.”Treating plastic like a drug habit that needs to be kicked is a lifestyle pledge being shared by more and more consumers, horrified by the tens of millions of metric tons of plastic created worldwide each year, much of it in the form of single-use items like straws, that end up in landfills or, worse, the oceans. As a marketing term, “plastic free” is emerging as the new “no carbs.” Stores that pride themselves on zero plastics have opened in Brooklyn and London, selling items like silicone water bottles, cardboard poop scoopers, biodegradable vibrators and iPhone cases made of flax. ImageReusable cloth bags are a must.CreditAdam Amengual for The New York TimesDesigners have embraced “plastic free” as a new challenge, whether it’s building a supermarket aisle without plastics or making eco-friendly clothing that does not involve “virgin” plastics. Celebrities including Jeff Bridges and SZA have joined the anti-plastic crusade.Some Fortune 500 companies, like Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, want a piece of the action. This summer, those companies will test selling products like Tropicana orange juice in glass bottles, Pantene shampoo in aluminum bottles and other items in refillable nonplastic containers, harking back to the days of the milkman.“The awareness has exploded,” said Susan Freinkel, a journalist in the Bay Area and the author of “Plastic: A Toxic Love Story.” “The movement to get rid of trivial plastic has taken off. There is a critical mass of consciousness.”But to exist in the modern world without plastic, however noble a goal, may not actually be possible.‘Grind Your Own’ If you gathered up all your plastic waste each week, as Ms. Terry once did, you would have a huge mound on the floor. Where to even begin?“The one thing I try to emphasize to people is to go step by step,” said Ms. Terry, an accountant who lives in Greenbelt, Md., and who is the author of “Plastic-Free: How I Kicked the Plastic Habit and How You Can Too.” “Don’t try to do everything at once. It’s been a practice of mine to not get overwhelmed by it all.”ImageA refrigerator filled with (almost) no plastic food containers.CreditAdam Amengual for The New York TimesThat’s easier said than done, because once you wake up to the plastic problem, you see it everywhere: in jars of peanut butter and bags of grapes, in tubes of toothpaste and Tupperware containers, in bottles of Dawn dish soap and Tide laundry detergent, in the wrappers of Doritos chips and the lining of milk cartons. “I thought I’d be able to find a plastic-free version of all the convenient foods I was consuming,” Ms. Terry said. “I didn’t realize that plastic made those foods possible.”At the grocery store, you find yourself staring at a 10-foot shelf of yogurt brands, with only one in a glass jar: Oui by Yoplait. But you don’t like Oui by Yoplait. Also, it costs much more. What do you do? To navigate the consumer minefield, plastic purgers develop mental maps of places where they can shop. It may take months, but they learn where to get milk in a glass bottle, or which health-food store lets you grind your own peanut butter. And rather than see it as a huge inconvenience, they treat living plastic free as a fun game.“I wake up and think, ‘How am I going to make it through the day without using any single-use plastic?’” said Dianna Cohen, 53, an artist in Santa Monica, Calif., and a founder of Plastic Pollution Coalition, an advocacy group. “Right away the challenge hits you in the bathroom with the toothbrush.”ImageDianna Cohen, a plastic purger, brings her own baskets to the Hollywood Farmers' Market in Los Angeles.CreditAdam Amengual for The New York TimesFor her, the answer is often the farmers’ markets, which exist year-round in Southern California. Needless to say, she brings her own bags. “I’m a big fan of baskets,” Ms. Cohen said. “I bring baskets and canvas bags to put vegetables in. I will bring my own glass jam jars.”Like many who aim to live plastic free, Ms. Cohen never leaves home without her eco-survival kit, which includes a steel cup, a set of bamboo utensils or metal spork, two stainless-steel straws and a cloth bag. To her, it’s totally worth the extra minutes spent in interactions with shops and clerks, and the time it takes to ready herself before leaving the house. “I have to be very thoughtful in advance,” she said.Plastic purgers need to rearrange their lives to avoid the offending material. If a restaurant serves food only on plastic plates, they won’t eat there. Fast food? Most wrappers contain plastic. Smoothies from a juice bar? Unless they put the smoothie in a stainless-steel to-go cup, move on, or make your own at home. Bread? Buy it from a local bakery to avoid fresh-seal bags. But there are certain situations where plastics are unavoidable. Try having a medical procedure without using a plastic syringe or an intravenous drip bag. Plastic water bottles can be indispensable after natural disasters.Despite their best efforts, the purgers all say they can’t totally banish plastic from their lives. For Ms. Cohen, it’s a favorite hairbrush she has had for decades. And Ms. Terry confronts the limits of her plastic ban each time she visits the pharmacy, where no pharmacist would put medicine in a Mason jar. ImagePickled vegetables sold in mason jars.CreditAdam Amengual for The New York Times“It’s a daily challenge,” Ms. Cohen said. “But I think it’s becoming easier. It’s really just learning new behavior.”Pig-Hair ToothbrushesGoing plastic free is also easier these days because there’s more awareness and alternatives. Stores now sell dental floss made of silk, wooden toothbrushes with pig-hair bristles, stainless-steel ice cube trays, food wrappers made with beeswax coated cotton, and other nonplastic versions of household items.Jay Sinha and Chantal Plamondon, who live in Wakefield, Quebec, started the store Life Without Plastic in 2006, a few years after their son was born. They wanted to avoid exposing him to bisphenol A, found in many baby bottles, but they had trouble finding a safer alternative. When Ms. Plamondon tracked down a glass bottle, it was one of the first items they sold.Since then, the site and its customers base have evolved. “It was more the mother crowd before, but in the past few years, it’s about plastic pollution, the oceans,” Ms. Plamondon said. “Recently we noticed more millennials shopping the site.” ImageMs. Cohen favors vendors who don't use plastic. CreditAdam Amengual for The New York TimesOne of those younger converts is Tessa Carleton, 24, who makes and sells handmade goods like macramé in rural Quebec. After a conversation with an environmentalist friend four years ago, Ms. Carleton donated or gave away the shampoo bottles, nail polish remover and Ziploc bags. And she is still purging.“It was a long process,” Ms. Carleton said. “I still don’t think it’s over.”The farmhouse she shares with her husband, Jacob, feels like a 75-year-old time capsule. In addition to raising pigs and chickens for food, they make their own deodorant, lip balm and body moisturizer. And almost everything, like the hemp shower curtain she bought from Life Without Plastic, is made of natural materials in subdued colors with no branding. It’s domestic life before the Plastic Age.Still, some wonder whether buying metal ice-cube trays is just another example of conscious consumerism. Buying a four-pack of metal straws at Urban Outfitters can be a kind of trendy virtue signaling. It offers a way to feel good without examining one’s larger environmental impact (like the energy required to ship glass or metal, both heavier than plastic). But those committed to living plastic free say that the small steps add up and make an impact. “Given that single-use disposable plastics are at the heart of the plastic pollution problem, if you do these simple things, you could potentially reduce your plastic consumption by 80 percent or maybe even more,” said Mr. Sinha, who wrote a guide to avoiding plastics with Ms. Plamondon.Nevertheless, it is usually more expensive to buy stainless-steel or wood items instead of plastic ones, or fresh foods instead of packaged ones. And it can be difficult to avoid plastic in poorer communities. Not everyone has access to year-round farmers’ markets, or the means to shop at them. (According to U.S.D.A. data, as of early February, 2019, more than 3200 farmer’s markets in the U.S. are authorized to accept food stamps.) Kristal Ambrose, 29, an environmental scientist who founded the Bahamas Plastic Movement, an advocacy group, faces that challenge daily. Much of what is sold on the island nation is imported and shipped in plastic. “I avoid plastic in areas where I can control,” said Ms. Ambrose, who carries bamboo cutlery and a reusable bottle with her at all times. “For me, not using a plastic bag means so much more. But the mother who’s juggling work, kids, other things — their priorities are different.”Part of her mission is to show that you don’t need to be rich to avoid plastic. “Sometimes people can’t afford a bamboo kit, but you can take a fork from home,” Ms. Ambrose said. “Even an old pasta sauce jar can be made into a reusable item.” Can you do it?9 Ways to Cut Down on PlasticIt’s all about reducing single-use plastics.Feb. 16, 2019"
5c31d1ad3a125f5075c03089,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/us/politics/tlaib-aoc-new-congress.html,"WASHINGTON — It took less than 48 hours into the new Congress for some of the most liberal freshmen of the now Democratic-controlled House to upend Capitol Hill — and they see no reason to slow down.They have pressed for an ambitious and costly climate change proposal that would eliminate the use of fossil fuels in 12 years and provide a job to anyone who wants one. After conservatives tried to embarrass Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York with old footage of her dancing, she faced them down by videotaping new footage of her dancing — outside her new congressional office.I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous.Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! 💃🏽Have a great weekend everyone :) pic.twitter.com/9y6ALOw4F6— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 4, 2019
Between dance numbers and knowing Instagram posts, she tried — and failed — to beat back an obscure austerity measure for the incoming Congress, and she floated plans to tax the extremely wealthy by as much as 70 percent. In the meantime, her freshman classmate Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was unapologetically upsetting Democratic talking points with an exuberant, expletive-filled pledge to impeach the president.“Congresswoman Tlaib was elected to shake up Washington, not continue the status quo,” her office said in a statement standing by her remarks even as President Trump was denouncing them, and her, on national television.In case it wasn’t already clear, the insurgent freshmen who promised bold and uncompromising action, uninterested in and unbowed by the strictures of the status quo, are showing no signs of wavering. They appear determined to push their party to the left, even as more experienced lawmakers fear that their antics and programs could divide the party and empower Republicans.“I think some lessons will be learned pretty quickly around here,” Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada and a former professor of political science, said after Ms. Tlaib’s profane outburst. “You don’t want to hand the gun for the other side to shoot you with.”The 2019 freshmen are hardly the first incoming class to come in swinging. The “Watergate babies” of 1975 came in with a mandate to clean up government. Newt Gingrich’s Republican Revolutionaries of 1995 and the Tea Party class of 2011 believed they had a mandate for conservative change; what they lacked in realism, they made up for in moxie.This new class has deeper ideological divisions, but its liberal wing is in the spotlight, thanks to the iPhone video-Instagram generation that powered its ascent. Its reach, as of yet, has gone only so far, though. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took pains to welcome the freshmen and praise their victories, must also attend to the demands of more moderate lawmakers whose victories in Republican districts sealed the party’s majority — and whose re-elections are necessary to keep it.Ms. Pelosi has curtailed many of the insurgent progressives’ demands. For instance, she held off on tasking a new climate change committee with a mandate to produce a “Green New Deal” and deprived it of subpoena power.She also put down an insurrection designed to block the reinstatement of so-called pay-as-you-go rules that require new spending to be offset by equal spending cuts or tax increases. The speaker assuaged liberals with an assurance that they could waive pay-as-you-go for legislative priorities, and she agreed to hearings for their “Medicare for All” single-payer health plan.But the newcomers’ mix of bold policy proposals and lighthearted personas has caught the nation’s attention — on Friday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest lawmaker in the chamber, surpassed Ms. Pelosi in Twitter followers. Their savvy, almost Trumpian use of social media may not pass a national health plan or a 70 percent income tax bracket, but it has helped muscle the policy conversation into the national discourse, and has nudged the party to the left.Representative Jackie Speier of California, one of the more senior women in the House, praised the new women for “invigorating the Congress” and “having the guts to say these rules don’t make any sense.” Nodding toward their tools of communication, she added, “I think what we’ve learned from President Trump is that people like authenticity.”The comparison to Mr. Trump may rankle, but their policy proposals bring to mind the Tea Party class of 2011, whose hard-right positions moved the Republican Party by making traditionally conservative proposals seem more moderate.“In many ways, the positions that very progressive caucus members take help provide space for us to get to yes on some hard issues for folks,” said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan.But there is concern. Liberal messaging bills with no legislative prospects will not be helpful, said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, one of more than two dozen Democrats elected in Trump districts and the new head of the House Democrats’ campaign arm. “If I have any say to what happens legislatively, it’s that we get something done.”Several of the freshman proposals are not particularly new. For years, liberals have demanded greater attention to climate change. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made Medicare for All central to his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.ImageInsurgent House Democratic freshmen have promised bold and uncompromising action.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBut they are adding a youthful veneer.“It’s not that they own it all by themselves,” said Representative Alan Lowenthal, Democrat of California. The new efforts, he added, are “pushing people who were ready to be pushed.”The downside of their undisciplined messaging power was on display Friday, as Ms. Tlaib’s impeachment comments ricocheted from the internet to the political conversation and overshadowed the rollout of the House Democrats’ first legislative priority, an ambitious overhaul of ethics and accountability measures. Instead of answering questions about the proposal, Democrats were forced to critique their newly sworn-in colleague, just as Republicans have been answerable to Mr. Trump’s tweets.“You cannot accomplish much of anything unless you have civility and show respect for your colleagues,” Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told reporters.The comments gave Republicans already irked by the progressive freshmen perhaps the most substantive fodder to date. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the Republicans’ messaging leader, warned anew of the foothold that Democratic “radicals” were gaining in the House.“Pelosi’s got her first test, and it happened on Day 1: How is she going to stand up to the most radical left elements of her party when they become unhinged?” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican.The kerfuffle is likely to be swamped by the coming fights over policy. The freshmen are teaming up with other liberals like Representatives Pramila Jayapal and Ro Khanna to make another run at repealing pay-as-you-go, arguing that Republicans put no such limits on themselves when they cut taxes by $1.5 trillion in 2017 or created the prescription drug benefit for Medicare in 2003.Ms. Tlaib and Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, have threatened to take aim at the longstanding pro-Israel positions of both parties.But no issue might be as problematic for Democrats as climate change, specifically how far the House should go to combat it when the Senate is in Republican hands, headed by a majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, who jealously guards the coal interests of his state, Kentucky.After two years of railing against Mr. Trump for denying the established science of climate change, Democrats are eager to make a difference on global warming. There’s little unity, however, over how to do it.A number of lawmakers have embraced a “Green New Deal,” an ambitious, still vague climate stimulus package inspired by the programs that Franklin D. Roosevelt created to pull the United States out of the Great Depression.“This is going to be the New Deal, the Great Society, the moon shot, the civil rights movement of our generation,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town-hall-style event.But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won’t be leading the climate change panel. Instead, Ms. Pelosi has tapped Representative Kathy Castor of Florida. She also sidestepped demands from progressives that the panel be specifically tasked with fleshing out the details of the Green New Deal, a move that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez publicly pilloried.In an interview, Ms. Castor had only praise for the freshmen’s efforts on climate change, calling them “transformative.”“Part of the message is, ‘No way, we do not have time for climate deniers, and we’re going to press on,’” she said. “Yes, they’re going to be pressing Democrats here, but I see a huge movement underway. This is our moment, and we need this youthful energy.”But Ms. Castor has history to worry about. In 2009 and 2010, House Democrats embraced a more market-oriented approach to climate change that would have capped the emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide and had companies trade credits to allow some to emit more than others, as long as overall emissions declined.Former Representative Henry Waxman, one of the bill’s authors, noted that the legislation was based on a plan developed by a coalition of leading environmental and business groups, including members of the fossil fuel industry, to encourage Republican support.“It turned out we were wrong. Republicans didn’t care at all what business interests had to say,” Mr. Waxman said.Ms. Pelosi muscled the bill through the House in 2009 at great cost to some Democrats in conservative areas, only to see the Senate not even touch it, even though it was in Democratic control. That House vote helped sweep Democrats from power the next year."
5c5876993a125f5075c07f10,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/science/north-magnetic-pole-model.html,"The north magnetic pole is restless.Distinct from the geographic North Pole, where all the lines of longitude meet at the top of the world, the magnetic pole is the point that a compass recognizes as north. At the moment, it’s located four degrees south of the geographic North Pole, which lies in the Arctic Ocean at 90 degrees north. But that wasn’t always the case.In the mid-19th century, the north magnetic pole floated much further south, roaming around Canada. For the past 150 years, however, the pole has been sprinting away from Canada and toward Siberia. That change of address cannot be ignored, given that magnetic compasses still underpin modern navigation, from the systems used by civilian and military airplanes to those that orient your iPhone.In 1965, scientists launched a data-based, mathematical representation of Earth’s magnetic field in order to better keep track of the pole’s ever-changing home. The World Magnetic Model is updated every five years — most recently in 2015 — because the magnetic field is constantly shifting.In early 2018, it became clear that 2015’s edition was in trouble, because the pole’s Siberian stroll had picked up speed, rendering the model — and therefore a number of navigational systems — incorrect.So for the first time, scientists have updated the model ahead of schedule, which they released Monday afternoon. Since this work was completed in the wake of the partial government shutdown (which delayed its full release), researchers still are trying to get a handle on the mysteries within Earth’s core that must be driving the magnetic pole’s surprising behavior.Heading NorthThe north magnetic pole, the point on the Earth where a compass needle would point down, is sliding about 35 miles closer to Russia each year.

The first magnetic maps, which were hand-drawn by exploring sailors, revealed that for the next two centuries, magnetic north twirled among the many islands and channels of the Arctic Archipelago. Then around 1860, it took a sharp turn and bee-lined toward Siberia. Since then, the pole has traveled nearly 1,500 miles and was most recently found in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, still en route to Russia.Scientists attribute this wanderlust to the liquid iron sloshing within our planet’s outer core. That iron is buoyant — it rises, cools and then sinks. And that motion below carries Earth’s magnetic field with it, producing changes above.ImageThe north magnetic pole is distinct from the geographic north pole, which is where all the lines of longitude meet at the top of the world. The magnetic pole is the point that compasses recognize as north.CreditNorman Kuring, NASA/GSFC/Suomi NPPTo more accurately map those changes, scientists launched the precursor to the World Magnetic Model nearly 55 years ago, which began as a collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom.The map we know today has existed in its current form since 1990 and is created by an agency within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the British Geological Survey (BGS). It’s commissioned by American and British military agencies, and used by many other militaries across the world.Alongside GPS, navigational systems utilized by satellites, aircraft, ships, submarines and other vehicles rely on magnetic compasses to ensure they’re traveling in the correct direction. Perhaps the most visible sign of this can be found at the end of every airport runway, where large white numbers reflect the runway’s magnetic heading.But as the magnetic field shifts, those headings change and runways get a makeover. Later this year, for example, the runways that make up the Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport in Wichita, Kan., will receive new names that match their new headings. The process — which includes repainting the huge numbers at the end of each runway and replacing other signage — will likely cost several hundred thousand dollars.And it all depends on the World Magnetic Model, which is not easy to build. Unlike the kilogram or the second, the magnetic field cannot be defined once and then used for decades. “The magnetic field is constantly changing,” said Susan McLean, the retired chief of the geophysical sciences division at NOAA, who helped set the magnetic model in the past. “It changes with time. It changes with location. And it changes the way it changes.” Tracking the planetary magnetic field, she added, is more akin to forecasting the weather.And like the weather, perfectly predicting where the pole will move is downright impossible. But scientists can get close with a wealth of data collected from satellite and ground-based observatories. That data allows them to deduce how the magnetic field has changed over the past several years and to extrapolate into the future with a model that will — hopefully — remain accurate for the next five years.The pole’s pilgrimageImageA changing magnetic pole will require repainting the headings on airport runways. The shift also affects navigation on flights with routes over the geographic North Pole.CreditMichael Phillips, via Getty ImagesAfter scientists released the World Magnetic Model in 2015, they periodically checked it against field measurements to ensure that it was accurately predicting variations in Earth’s magnetic field. When they ran that check in early 2018, they discovered that the model and reality were out of alignment.“We noticed that the error in the Arctic was increasing faster than what we would expect,” said Arnaud Chulliat, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado at Boulder and NOAA.Although the north magnetic pole has long been scurrying away from Canada and toward Siberia, the rate at which it moves drastically changes. Throughout most of the 20th century, it drifted at roughly 6 miles per year. In the 1980s, magnetic north picked up speed, and by the year 2000 it was traveling at 35 miles per year on the way out of Canada. Then, in 2015, the pole actually slowed to 30 miles per year. So when the team issued the most recent magnetic map, scientists predicted that the speed would continue dropping — only it didn’t. Just after the model was released, the north magnetic pole picked up momentum again, and now it is fluctuating at around 35 miles per year. In late 2017, the pole crossed the international date line into the Eastern Hemisphere.“It’s not the fact that the pole is moving that is a problem, it’s the fact that it’s accelerating at this rate,” said William Brown, a geophysicist at the British Geological Survey. “The more acceleration or deceleration there is, the harder to predict where the thing is going to be.”And that means the model is currently incorrect — at least, in the Arctic.While many of us might not spend much time — or any time — at the top of the world, some international airline flights fly close to the geographic North Pole. They need the magnetic model to be accurate for safe journeys. If you were to use the current model to travel to the north magnetic pole, you would end up 25 miles away from where the pole actually resides.So scientists raced to fix the model by feeding it several years of recent data. Together, B.G.S. and NOAA have made a new version available. But efforts to finish the revision on publicly available online systems maintained by NOAA were delayed by the partial government shutdown in the United States. The researchers were able to complete the update on Monday.The public maps will have many uses, from recalculating runway names to ensuring that Defense Department systems are properly installed. Engineers incorporate the model into the navigation systems on your smartphone and in your car, Dr. Brown said.But for most people at low- and mid-latitudes, the current model is safe to use.“South of 65 degrees north and away from Canada, the average user will notice very little difference to their daily life,” said Ciaran Beggan, a geophysicist at B.G.S.Geomagnetic apocalypse? Probably notWith the updates now complete, scientists are anxious to understand the causes of the pole’s Siberian sprint. “It’s clear that something strange is happening,” said Phil Livermore, a geophysicist at the University of Leeds in England.On multiple occasions during Earth’s long history, the magnetic field has weakened dramatically. The north magnetic pole slipped toward the bottom of the planet, and the south magnetic sauntered toward the top. The process took a few thousand years, but by the time the field’s full strength returns, it has flipped.The pole’s recent journey, along with other changes — like a weakening of Earth’s magnetic field — has led some scientists to wonder whether such a reversal might be around the corner, geologically speaking.“It does tick off some of the boxes of magnetic reversal,” said Courtney Sprain, a geophysicist at the University of Liverpool in England, who added that, “we definitely can’t say that for sure.”Most scientists, including Dr. Sprain, doubt an impending geomagnetic reversal. First, while the north magnetic pole does appear to be on the move, it doesn’t represent a global phenomenon, just a regional one.Dr. Livermore, for example, thinks there are two large magnetic structures in the planet’s outer core, one beneath Canada and one beneath Siberia, which interact together to emit the magnetic pole. The Canadian patch is weakening, which means that it’s essentially losing a tug-of-war, causing the north magnetic pole to turn toward Siberia. At the same time, the south magnetic pole is standing relatively still.Second, while Earth’s magnetic field is weakening, many experts argue that it’s still above the long-term geologic average.Peter Olson, a geophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, thinks that the current changes represent a transient fluctuation and not a reversal.“It’s the analogy between a stock market correction and a worldwide depression,” he said. “How do you know the stock market today is not heading toward a worldwide depression, a crash? Well, it could be. But much more likely, it’s a correction and it will rebound.”Even if the magnetic field were on the edge of a flip, scientists argue that it’s not an apocalyptic scenario. Although the field provides essential protection from the sun’s powerful radiation, fossil records reveal no mass extinctions during past reversals. And whatever the risks to power grids and communications, humanity would have ample time to prepare.“Of all the problems we have, this is not a top 10 problem,” said Dr. Olson.Earlier reporting on magnetic fluctuations and the North Pole Ancient Jars Hold Clues About Earth’s Fluctuating Magnetic FieldsFeb. 14, 2017Newly Discovered Prehistoric Bird Lived Near a Balmy North PoleDec. 22, 2016Diary of the Earth's Magnetic Field Shows a Temporary CalmMay 16, 2006"

Sign up here.)There are other ways to tax the wealthyA majority of Americans are increasingly open to raising taxes on the wealthy. Lawmakers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders have proposed revolutionary ways of reducing wealth inequality. But Andrew writes that there are other ways of bridging the gap — ways that stand a chance of becoming law.Start with the estate tax. Gary Cohn, the former White House economic adviser, once said, “Only morons pay the estate tax.” Andrew recommends starting there, writing that no fix could work without this. One solution: taxing inherited property at its current worth to capture gains in value made over decades. According to the Congressional Budget Office, closing this loophole could raise more than $650 billion over a decade.Raise capital gains rates for the wealthy. Andrew suggests introducing two new tax brackets — say, a marginal 30 percent bracket for those earning over $5 million and a 35 percent bracket for over $15 million — so the U.S. could raise money without discouraging investment.Close the carried-interest loophole. Current tax law allows executives at investment firms to have bonuses taxed as capital gains, not ordinary income. Scrapping that — an idea that President Trump has supported — has clear appeal to Americans’ basic sense of fairness.Reconsider breaks for charitable giving. At a minimum, Andrew writes, “we ought to consider whether the wealthy should be allowed to take deductions when they move money to their own foundations, or whether they should only take a deduction when the money is spent.” Support the I.R.S. “The agency is so underfunded that the chance an individual gets audited is minuscule,” Andrew writes.Deadline extension doesn’t end the trade warPresident Trump has delayed his own March 1 deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport of the NYT report:• Mr. Trump cited “substantial progress” in trade talks between American and Chinese officials.• He said that negotiators had forged a compromise on key issues, including intellectual property and the trade of agriculture and energy products.• The president also expects to meet with President Xi Jinping of China to finalize a deal.“The extension will prevent the United States from increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2,” Ms. Swanson and Mr. Rappeport write. “The delay, which Mr. Trump had dangled as a possibility in recent weeks, is likely to calm volatile financial markets and reassure business owners who depend on China.”But there is still uncertainty. “In a hint of how fluid the talks remain, the two sides did not sign an official agreement and the White House did not release details on any agreements,” Ms. Swanson and Mr. Rappeport write. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua says that “new uncertainties” could emerge, and analysts think trade tensions won’t go away.Tensions are reportedly high inside the White House.  Mr. Trump and his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, “have grown increasingly frustrated with each other,” Bloomberg reports, citing unidentified sources. Mr. Trump was apparently embarrassed when Mr. Lightizer corrected him in front of the Chinese delegation, while Mr. Lightizer “has been growing irritated with Mr. Trump’s interventions.”Theresa May delayed a crucial Brexit voteThe British prime minister announced yesterday that a final vote on her Brexit deal that had been scheduled for this week will now take place by March 12 — just 17 days before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U.She is trying to buy time, so that she can secure tweaks to the agreement that will make it palatable to British lawmakers. “We still have it within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on the 29th of March,” she told reporters. The Confederation of British Industry accused her of “running down the clock.”Parliament could undermine her game plan. Mrs. May is trying to keep the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on the table, hoping that will convince lawmakers to support her deal. Yet a proposal that will go to vote in Parliament this week “would force the government to hand power to Parliament if no U.K.-E.U. withdrawal deal has been approved by March 13,” the FT notes.The E.U. is reportedly considering a delay. “The European Union is considering telling Theresa May that if she can’t get her Brexit deal through Parliament and wants to delay the departure date, the country will have to stay in the bloc until 2021,” Bloomberg reports.How the dollar has kept its crownThe U.S. economy looks precarious, thanks to an enormous public debt and turbulent politics. But as Peter Goodman of the NYT points out, the dollar remains the world’s haven, at least when it comes to currencies.• “Because banks cannot risk jeopardizing their access to the plumbing of the dollar-based global financial network, they have taken pains to steer clear of nations and companies deemed pariahs in Washington.”• “In a clear indication that the American currency has been gaining power, dollar-denominated lending to borrowers outside the United States, excluding banks, soared between late 2007 and early 2018, according to the Bank for International Settlements.”• “The Chinese government’s restrictions on taking money out of the country and its alarming detentions of foreigners — often in parallel with geopolitical scrapes — have tested the appeal of holding money embossed with the image of Chairman Mao.”• “A series of crises within the 19 countries that share the euro has provoked more animosity than unity, revealing a foundational defect: The euro is a common currency lacking a common political structure that can guarantee a robust response when trouble arises.”• “‘There is no alternative to the dollar,’ said Mark Blyth, an international political economist at Brown University.”ImageRichard Yu, the C.E.O. of Huawei’s consumer unit, showing off the Mate X folding phone.CreditAndreu Dalmau/EPA, via ShutterstockWhat to expect from the world’s biggest mobile showMobile World Congress, the world’s largest mobile technology event, takes place in Barcelona this week. Here’s what will be grabbing headlines:• So much 5G. The next-generation wireless standard has been making political as well as technological headlines recently. Carriers will announce their plans, while countries continue to weigh the security implications of using Huawei hardware in their networks.• Folding phones. Samsung was first with its Galaxy Fold. Now Huawei has unveiled its own folding phone, the Mate X, and other manufacturers are expected to follow suit.• Eye-watering prices. The $1,000 iPhone X seemed expensive initially. But experimental smartphones like the Galaxy Fold and Mate X cost twice as much. (Don’t worry: Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion argues that you aren’t expected to buy one just yet.)Hacking attacks escalate at financial services firmsBritain’s Financial Conduct Authority says that financial services companies in the country experienced a fivefold rise in data breaches last year, the FT reports:• “Companies reported 145 breaches to the F.C.A. last year, up from 25 in 2017, with investment banks reporting the highest number of incidents at 34, up from just three the previous year.”• “Last year’s jump in reported attacks can partly be explained by the introduction of the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation last May, which requires businesses to identify and report cyber attacks within 72 hours or face penalties.”• “But executives at major banks and payments companies said they were now under almost constant fire from attackers. A chief information officer at one U.K. bank said: ‘We are seeing a lot more threat actors knocking at the front door.’”ImageA scene from Netflix’s “Roma.”CreditAlfonso Cuarón/Netflix, via Associated PressHow long until Netflix wins a best picture Oscar?The big winner of last night’s Academy Awards was “Green Book,” which took the best picture trophy. Commentators regarded the decision as a deliberate snub of Netflix, which had pushed aggressively for “Roma.”.Netflix didn’t play by the rules. The company spent millions promoting “Roma,” but refused to let it run exclusively in movie theaters for an industry-standard three months. (It ran for three weeks before being streamed.) Netflix also refused to release box-office data.That annoyed Hollywood traditionalists. Several theater chains refused to show “Roma.” Steven Spielberg is among those who think Netflix films shouldn’t contend for an Oscar: “Once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie,” he has said. “You certainly, if it’s a good show, deserve an Emmy — but not an Oscar.”The reluctance will be tested. “That debate is only going to grow more contentious as Netflix commissions more and more films from A-list filmmakers,” Gregg Kilday of The Hollywood Reporter writes.Revolving doorEv Williams, one of Twitter’s co-founders, is stepping down from its board after 12 years.AutoNation hired Carl Liebert as its new C.E.O., succeeding Mike Jackson.Tony Nicely stepped down as C.E.O. of Berkshire Hathaway’s Geico insurer last year, Warren Buffett disclosed on Saturday.Caesars Entertainment reportedly offered to let Carl Icahn help pick its next C.E.O.The White House nominated Kelly Kraft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, as its pick for U.S. ambassador to the U.N.The British insurer Legal & General named Michelle Scrimgeour as chief of its investment management unit.The speed readDeals• Barrick Gold unveiled a $17.8 billion unsolicited takeover bid for Newmont Mining.

What now?The special counsel, Robert Mueller, did not find evidence that President Trump coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr said yesterday. But the White House still faces legal challenges.Mr. Trump claimed victory from the report, which concluded Mr. Mueller’s two-year investigation into the Russia issue. Especially comforting to the president: Mr. Mueller did not recommend additional indictments of his inner circle.The president was not found to have obstructed justice, Mr. Barr added, saying that the special counsel did not find enough evidence. But the report did not exonerate Mr. Trump on this accusation, as Mr. Mueller did not provide a verdict either way.Mr. Trump derided the inquiry as an “illegal takedown that failed,” and demanded that those responsible for it face additional scrutiny. That triumphalism ran counter to advice from aides.But the White House isn’t in the clear yet. Congressional Democrats pledged to continue pursuing investigations into Trump and his allies. And prosecutors in New York City are still investigating an array of issues that touch on Mr. Trump’s business and political dealings.The markets may get a small boost from the end of the investigation, according to analysts who spoke to CNBC.China’s new trade play: opennessChina’s top economic policymakers have promised more market-based competition and international trade, in the latest sign that the country is eager to end its trade war with the U.S., Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes.The promises being made were significant. Officials at the China Development Forum, the country’s premier annual economic policy conference, spoke of increasing imports, a desire for more foreign investment and a willingness to allow foreign financial firms to own larger stakes in their Chinese competitors.They may sound familiar, however. “Chinese officials have said for years that they were ready to allow foreign competitors to enter their market on a more equal footing,” Mr. Bradsher writes. “The promises made over the weekend in many cases repeated pledges that have been made before.”But China now has other reasons to embrace openness. “In addition to a trade war that is hitting the country’s exporters, China’s economy has also been hurt by private sector business leaders who have become increasingly cautious in recent months about making new investments,” Mr. Bradsher adds.The promises will most likely feature in trade talks. American and Chinese officials are scheduled to hold trade talks in Beijing in the coming days, and another round of talks in Washington the following week.ImageBoeing 737 Max planes at a factory in Renton, Wash.CreditLindsey Wasson/ReutersBoeing scrambles to fix its 737 Max problemThe airplane maker is taking more steps to convince the authorities and customers that fixes for its 737 Max 8 jets — two of which have crashed in recent months — are near.It tested a software update  for the Max 8 aircraft with pilots from five airlines over the weekend, the NYT reports. Using flight simulators, the pilots were able to safely land planes suffering from problems believed to have brought down Lion Air Flight 610 last year.And the company outlined other software fixes that are meant to eliminate flaws in an automated piloting program at the heart of the crashes. Boeing also said that it would now make two previously optional safety features on the planes free of charge.But Boeing is facing heat from Congress over the safety-certification process that cleared the Max 8 for flight. Lawmakers are concerned about how much responsibility the company held for certifying the safety of its own planes.More Boeing news: How the company rushed to roll out the 737 Max to catch up with Airbus. Why the crashes highlight the challenges of adding modern software to older technology. And why JPMorgan Chase economists worry about broader fallout from Boeing’s problems.Don’t panic, but part of the yield curve invertedThe yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Since 1960, every time that it has inverted — when long-term rates were lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed.It happened on Friday.More on that from Matt Phillips of the NYT:• “The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled to 2.44 percent Friday, its lowest level since January 2018. That was just below the 2.45 percent yield on three-month Treasury bills.”• “Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has cited the yield difference between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes — which inverted Friday — as the most reliable predictor of recession risk.”• “On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent, as stock market investors grew concerned about the outlook for economic growth. It was the second-worst drop for the market this year.”Don’t hyperventilate. Some parts of the yield curve have not yet inverted, and experts say the inversion doesn’t necessarily predict economic collapse. “A model is just a model,” Campbell Harvey, a Duke University finance professor, told the NYT. “It’s not an oracle. It helps us forecast the future, but it might at any point fail.”ImageCreditJosh Edelson/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesComing up: Apple’s big media announcementWith smartphone sales stagnating, Apple is making a push to make money from services.

But meetings over the weekend with high-profile Euroskeptic lawmakers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to gain their backing. That means she still lacks the support needed to win a third vote on her proposal.All this comes against the backdrop of public demand for a second referendum on Brexit. On Saturday, an estimated 1 million people marched through London to demand a new vote on leaving the E.U.ImageElon MuskCreditJae C. Hong/Associated PressMusk says the S.E.C. is ‘virtually wrong at every level’ about his tweetsAs the S.E.C. and Elon Musk continue to fight in court over his tweeting, the Tesla C.E.O. fired back on Friday. His latest argument: the agency is incorrectly interpreting a settlement agreement between the two.Mr. Musk’s insists his tweet review process is O.K. In his view, he is supposed to only run tweets containing material information about Tesla by an in-house lawyer — and he is free to determine what qualifies. An earlier draft of the settlement, offered by the S.E.C., would have required him to run all public statements by a lawyer. He rejected that proposal.He also says the tweet that drew the ire of the S.E.C. wasn’t controversial. His comment about Tesla production forecasts, he argues, contained information that had previously been made public, and was made after stock markets closed for the day. But the S.E.C. says that’s an after-the-fact rationalization.It’s up to a judge to decide whether Mr. Musk violated the settlement and should be held in contempt. The S.E.C. has declined to ask for a hearing on the matter, The Verge reports, since it believes it has already made its case.A life without screens is a luxurySilicon Valley’s business model pretty much relies on pervasive screens being a good thing. But Big Tech’s most successful executives increasingly spend lots of money to shelter themselves from the digital reality they helped create, Nellie Bowles of the NYT reports, potentially creating a new class divide.• At first, tech products like Facebook and Gmail were democratic: They were the same no matter who you were, and they were free. Companies extolled the value of widespread laptop use in schools, arguing that they were preparing kids for the future.• But now schools that are short of cash, like those in Kansas, focus on screens, not human interaction. And low-income elderly patients rely on digital avatars to keep them company.• Meanwhile, Ms. Bowles writes, “As wealthy kids are growing up with less screen time, poor kids are growing up with more.

Every Monday, S.L. editor Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Here’s what my browser generally looks like: work email in the left-most tab, always open. TweetDeck in the next one, always open. A few Google Docs tabs with projects I’m working on, followed by my calendar, Facebook, YouTube, this publication’s website and about 10 stories I want to read — along with whatever random shiny thing comes across my desktop. (Not to mention my iPhone constantly nagging me, though I’ve mostly fixed that problem.)This is no way to work! It’s awful, and my attention is divided across a dozen different things. My situation is far from unique, and most people who do most of their work on a computer know it all too well.Enter “deep work,” a concept coined by one of my favorite thinkers in this space, Cal Newport. He published a book in 2016 by that name, and in it he details his philosophy and strategy for actually focusing on the things we can do and accomplish.This week I’ve invited Cal, whose new book, “Digital Minimalism,” comes out next month, to talk about how to do deep work, why it matters and how we can use it in our lives.Tim Herrera: Hey, Cal! Thanks so much for chatting with me this week. For those who don’t know: What exactly is deep work?Cal Newport: Deep work is my term for the activity of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It describes, in other words, when you’re really locked into doing something hard with your mind.TH: So, like, closing your email tab or putting your phone in a drawer?CN: Right. In order for a session to count as deep work there must be zero distractions. Even a quick glance at your phone or email inbox can significantly reduce your performance due to the cost of context switching.TH: You use a term in your book to describe that feeling: attention residue. What exactly do you mean by that, and what’s the reason for it? Is there a way to actually avoid it?CN: Every time you switch your attention from one target to another and then back again, there’s a cost. This switching creates an effect that psychologists call attention residue, which can reduce your cognitive capacity for a non-trivial amount of time before it clears. If you constantly make “quick checks” of various devices and inboxes, you essentially keep yourself in a state of persistent attention residue, which is a terrible idea if you’re someone who uses your brain to make a living.[Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]TH: You outline the four rules of deep work in your book, which I think is a great place to start for someone who’s just learning about these ideas. Let’s go through them. What is the first rule of deep work, and how do I apply it to my life?CN: The first rule is to “work deeply.” The idea here is that if you want to successfully integrate more deep work into your professional life, you cannot just wait until you find yourself with lots of free time and in the mood to concentrate. You have to actively fight to incorporate this into your schedule. It helps, for example, to include deep work blocks on my calendar like meetings or appointments and then protect them as you would a meeting or appointment.TH: And that has a lot to do with habit formation vs. willpower, too, right?CN: Right. Deep work is demanding, and our brains, which are evolved to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure, therefore try to avoid it if possible. We’re simply not evolved to give concentration the same priority that we might give to evading a charging lion. Therefore, you cannot rely on willpower alone. You need all the help you can get to trick yourself into getting started with this activity.TH: So, great, we’ve got a strategy to build habits around deep work and to actually do it. What’s rule two?CN: The second rule is to “embrace boredom.” The broader point here is that the ability to concentrate is a skill that you have to train if you expect to do it well. A simple way to get started training this ability is to frequently expose yourself to boredom. If you instead always whip out your phone and bathe yourself in novel stimuli at the slightest hint of boredom, your brain will build a Pavlovian connection between boredom and stimuli, which means that when it comes time to think deeply about something (a boring task, at least in the sense that it lacks moment-to-moment novelty), your brain won’t tolerate it.TH: Which is a perfect segue into your third rule of deep work.CN: The third rule is to “quit social media.” The basic idea is that people need to be way more intentional and selective about what apps and services they allow into their digital lives. If you only focus on possible advantages, you’ll end up, like so many of us today, with a digital life that’s so cluttered with thrumming, shiny knots of distraction pulling at our attention and manipulating our moods that we end up a shell of our potential. In “Deep Work,” I introduced this idea mainly to help professionals protect their ability to focus, but it hit a nerve, and eventually evolved into the popular digital minimalism movement that I’ve been writing about more recently.For example, I’ve never had a social media account, and though I may have missed out on various small advantages here and there, I’m convinced that it has had large positive impacts on my professional output and personal satisfaction.TH: Which brings us full circle to your final rule of deep work: “Drain the shallows.” What does that mean, and how do we do it?CN: “Shallow work” is my term for anything that doesn’t require uninterrupted concentration. This includes, for example, most administrative tasks like answering email or scheduling meetings. If you allow your schedule to become dominated by shallow work, you’ll never find time to do the deep efforts that really move the needle. It’s really important, therefore, that you work to aggressively minimize optional shallow work and then be very organized and productive about how you execute what remains. It’s not that shallow work is bad, but that its opposite, deep work, is so valuable that you have to do everything you can to make room for it.TH: That’s perfect. I’m taking this to be permission to ignore all of my emails, and now I’m going to go delete my Twitter. Thanks so much for chatting, Cal. Any last words on how we can make deep work work in our lives?CN: When it comes to topics like distraction in the workplace, my philosophy is that instead of focusing too much on what’s bad about distractions, it’s important to step back and remember what’s so valuable about its opposite. Concentration is like a super power in most knowledge work pursuits. If you take the time to cultivate this power, you’ll never look back.How do you find focus in your work?

A new study found that most authors’ incomes are below the poverty line.Tip of the WeekThis week I’ve invited the writer Stephanie Dubick to tell us how to ask our parents questions that matter.We spend a lot of time cultivating different relationships in our lives. From best friends to significant others, casual acquaintances to semi-awkward relationships with co-workers, we learn a lot about one another through the bonds we build.But what about our relationship with our parents? While we might look to those who raised us for guidance, support and discussions about when we might be moving out, we can also look to them for more intimate conversations, to understand who they are and where they came from. Parents are people, too, right? Why not get to know them better?First things first: Ask them about themselves. Ask them about their childhood, what it was like growing up where they did, what their relationship was like with their parents, regrets they have and important lessons they’ve learned. If you’re looking to clear up what happened with a divorce, or to understand a family secret you’ve been hearing about for years, go for it. Ask away! Questions like these can evolve into larger conversations that reveal aspects about our parents we never knew before. It can give us a deeper sense of identity, and it may clear up past issues or traumas.Of course, our relationship with our parents varies. Sometimes we get along with them, sometimes we don’t. But, if you’re looking to improve a connection, or to learn about your parents’ past, go ahead, ask them a question or two (or three) and learn a little bit about the people who raised you. You may learn a lot about yourself."

En la última semana, nueve mujeres han denunciado por acoso o abuso sexual al exmandatario costarricense y su caso se ha vuelto el de más alto perfil del movimiento #MeToo en América Latina. Sin embargo, el temor de las mujeres de hacer públicas sus acusaciones y los retos para conseguir representación legal han entorpecido el camino contra uno de los hombres más poderosos del país centroamericano. Yazmín Morales, quien fuera reina de belleza en Costa Rica, por ejemplo, cuenta que su caso fue rechazado por al menos tres de los principales abogados del país.ImageUna manifestación en respaldo a las mujeres que han denunciado al expresidente costarricense por acoso y abuso sexual, el 8 de febreroCreditJuan Carlos Ulate/Reuters• La oposición venezolana reparte ayuda humanitaria antes de una nueva jornada de protestas. Juan Guaidó, quien se juramentó presidente encargado de Venezuela a finales de enero, dijo ayer que una primera tanda de medicinas y suplementos alimenticios fue repartida a niños y mujeres embarazadas, sin dar detalles de cómo se consiguieron los productos. Una de la promesas de la oposición mientras intenta que Nicolás Maduro deje el poder es empezar a paliar los efectos de la crisis económica. Guaidó convocó a marchar hoy para exigir que las fuerzas armadas permitan el paso de más ayuda humanitaria a través de la frontera con Colombia.Maduro, por su parte, presentó ayer en un acto público la marca país Venezuela y declaró que “no hay otro país en el mundo con mayores oportunidades, con mayores ventajas para la inversión”.

5c62ad9f3a125f5075c093b5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/business/dealbook/border-government-shutdown.html,"Good Tuesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.The best shot yet at averting a new shutdownDemocratic and Republican negotiators said last night that they had an “agreement in principle” on border security funding that could keep the federal government open.The deal includes $1.38 billion to pay for 55 miles of new fencing, technology and staffing for border protection. It’s not the $5.7 billion that President Trump had demanded to build a 200-mile wall. Democrats waived their demand for limits on detention capacity for immigrants.But there’s no guarantee that it will go through. The House and Senate would have to vote on the pact, and Mr. Trump would have to sign it. “I think everyone will say, ‘Good work,’ ” Representative Kay Granger of Texas, one of the Republican negotiators, said. Still, at a rally in Texas last night, Mr. Trump insisted that he will build a wall. And influential Republican commentators like the Fox News host Sean Hannity called the deal a “garbage compromise.”The remaining alternatives are hugely unattractive. Politico notes that a potential White House plan to redirect unspent federal funds toward the wall would “create a firestorm.” And another government shutdown could hit the U.S. economy and endanger aviation safety.Theresa May wants more timeThe British prime minister is scheduled to update lawmakers later today on progress in negotiations on withdrawing from the E.U.She has a big favor to ask. Mrs. May is focused on making changes to the so-called backstop in her exit deal, which is designed to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. She has made little headway. Bloomberg explains her plan for today:• Mrs. May will “update Parliament on the progress of talks with the E.U. and outline a motion she’ll put before M.P.s for debate on Thursday, her office said.”• She “is expected to ask Parliament to restate its demand to remove the backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement and to promise a further vote if she hasn’t brought a renegotiated deal back to Parliament by Feb. 27.”• The aim is “to reassure members from across the House of Commons who are concerned that May is deliberately running down the clock and risking a potentially disastrous no-deal divorce.”But the E.U. still isn’t budging. Its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said yesterday that “something has to give on the British side.”Yet Mrs. May could force her plan through Parliament. Bloomberg explains how, though it also admits that “a lot could go wrong.”More Brexit news: Britain had its weakest economic growth in six years last year. It has signed a trade deal with Switzerland, its biggest since the 2016 Brexit referendum. And its government is being sued for awarding a contract for freight shipments after a no-deal Brexit to a ferry company with no boats.ImagePaul Volcker, left, and Ray Dalio.CreditYouTubePaul Volcker’s fight to fix WashingtonThe former Fed chairman recently sat down with Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Capital for a wide-ranging conversation, with topics from the state of the U.S. to the principles of good government. Don’t have time to watch? Here are the highlights:On Washington: Mr. Volcker lamented the condition of the U.S. government, repeating past criticisms. “You’ve got presidents who don’t seem to mind either personal behavior or making outrageous statements, true or not,” he told Mr. Dalio. “You have a Congress that’s been unable to function effectively.”On the Civil Service: For the former Fed chairman, an important problem to solve now is how to make government work again appear to be honorable. “Public administration’s a bad word now,” he told Mr. Dalio, leaving important government departments without effective leaders.What Mr. Volcker is doing: He has set up the Volcker Alliance, which is meant to help schools train future government officials. “It’s a great trick,” Mr. Volcker said. “How can you get the expertise and leadership you need and still respect the popular desire?”Americans are thrilled about their financesOptimism about personal finances hasn’t been this high in more than 16 years, according to a study by Gallup.Sixty-nine percent of Americans expect to be better off this time next year. That is “only two percentage points below the all-time high of 71 percent, recorded in March 1998,” according to Gallup. That’s in a survey carried out between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10, in the middle of the government shutdown.Half of respondents say they’re better off than they were a year ago. That figure had been consistently under half since 2007, Gallup says.The optimism is hard to overstate. “Only 11 times in 109 polls stretching back to 1976 have at least half of those polled said they were in better financial shape than they had been a year prior,” Gallup notes. “Only once in 114 polls going back to 1977 have Americans been more optimistic about their personal finances in the coming year than they are today.”George Soros has a warning for Europe“Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion, and the people of Europe need to wake up before it is too late,” George Soros writes in an opinion piece on Project Syndicate:• “Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain.”• “The next inflection point will be the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. Unfortunately, anti-European forces will enjoy a competitive advantage in the balloting.”• “The first step to defending Europe from its enemies, both internal and external, is to recognize the magnitude of the threat they present. The second is to awaken the sleeping pro-European majority and mobilize it to defend the values on which the E.U. was founded.”Morgan Stanley bets on future millionairesThe firm said yesterday that it would buy Solium Capital, which manages stock paid out to corporate employees, for $900 million. It’s the biggest deal by a major Wall Street firm since the financial crisis — so what’s the rationale?The bank wants in on millennial wealth. Solium’s clients include start-ups, like Instacart and Stripe, which could go public at multibillion-dollar valuations — making some employees very rich.Wall Street approves of the strategy. Analysts at Evercore ISI wrote yesterday that Solium gives Morgan Stanley “a real path towards the organic growth and next generation of clients that many investors have been questioning.” Matthew Klein of Barron’s wrote last week that millennials could hold the key to improving American productivity — and wealth.And banks seem newly hungry for deals. Days before Morgan Stanley’s acquisition, BB&T agreed to buy SunTrust in the biggest bank merger since the 2008 crisis. Banking chiefs seem heartened by loosened regulations on their sector — and eager to capitalize through acquisitions. “We’d like to do more,” James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s C.E.O., told the WSJ. (And JPMorgan Chase has reportedly considered buying the asset manager WisdomTree, according to Bloomberg.)ImageMario DraghiCreditVincent Kessler/ReutersWho will run the E.C.B. after Mario Draghi?It’s just eight months until Mario Draghi’s finishes his nonrenewable term as president of the European Central Bank. Choosing his successor is both important and difficult, the WSJ reports:• Investors have trusted Mr. Draghi, the WSJ says, as they navigate “a toxic mix of risks in Europe, from Brexit to trade wars.”• “At least five unofficial candidates appear to be in the running to replace him, according to European officials: two Frenchmen, two Finns and a German. The candidates have very different economic philosophies, and there is no clear front-runner.”• The winner might be chosen to balance the nationalities of the E.U.’s leadership, rather than purely on merit. The WSJ quotes Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Centre for European Policy Studies, a Brussels think tank, on the risks of that. “It’s the most systemically important job in Europe, this man controls the show,” he said. “It can go badly wrong.”Grading China’s slowdownWSJ reporters scoured fourth-quarter results from U.S. companies in an attempt to better understand the slowing of China’s economic growth.What they found: Many companies are “struggling with weaker demand from export manufacturers in China, which are pulling back amid fears that trade tensions will worsen,” Austen Hufford and Theo Francis of the WSJ report. “Retailers and other companies catering to Chinese consumers face signs of weakness among the country’s growing middle class. They are buying fewer cars, phones and are traveling less.”The conclusion: “The indications are that slowing growth there is broad, if still modest,” Mr. Hufford and Mr. Francis write.Revolving doorJust half of PG&E’s directors will stand for re-election this year after the utility filed for bankruptcy amid the California wildfires.Colgate-Palmolive named Noel Wallace, its C.O.O., as  chief executive, replacing Ian Cook.GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet, hired David Schenkein, the former C.E.O. of Agios Pharmaceuticals, as its co-head of life sciences.Apple named Frank Casanova, a longtime iPhone executive, as its first head of marketing for augmented reality.Sony appointed Jim Ryan as C.E.O. of its PlayStation business.The speed readDeals• Colony Capital, the investment firm founded by the real estate mogul Tom Barrack, will explore selling assets after an activist hedge fund, Blackwells Capital, took a stake.

5c54704d3a125f5075c07929,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/netflix-canada-best-february.html,"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.Movies‘Back to the Future’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Netflix is adding all three “Back to the Future” movies at the beginning of February, but the first remains a high-water mark of blockbuster filmmaking, both a technical marvel and an exquisitely crafted mix of screwball comedy and science fiction. The director Robert Zemeckis and his longtime screenwriting partner Bob Gale have an appreciation for the mechanics of the form, those tiny gears and springs that make complicated storytelling look effortless. There’s plenty of fun to be had in watching Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) go back to the ‘50s to save his scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) and play matchmaker to his own parents, but “Back to the Future” is also an intricately worked-out time travel movie.‘Nocturnal Animals’Starts streaming: Feb. 1For his follow-up to the impeccable 2009 debut feature “A Single Man,” the designer turned director Tom Ford stirred some controversy with “Nocturnal Animals,” a neo-noir that opens with a much-talked-about montage of women dancing in the nude and gets more provocative from there. The extreme archness of Ford’s style proves a good match for the material, a matryoshka doll of narratives about an art gallery owner (Amy Adams) whose first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) surprises her with a manuscript of his novel. Michael Shannon is particularly good in the story-within-a-story as a West Texas detective assigned to sort through a grisly kidnapping and murder case.‘Schindler’s List’Starts streaming: Feb. 1After surfacing in theaters last year for its 25th anniversary, Steven Spielberg’s Holocaust drama arrives on Netflix as a timely reminder of the human potential for evil and its equal capacity for courage and compassion. Shooting in a black and white that’s alternately stark and lustrous, Spielberg looks at history through the complicated lens of a German businessman (Liam Neeson) who staffs a Krakow factory with mostly Jewish workers and succeeds in protecting them from extermination once the SS comes around. Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performance as an SS second lieutenant who oversees the construction of a concentration camp at Krakow and brings in captives from liquidated Jewish ghettos.‘The Lego Batman Movie’Starts streaming: Feb. 1After Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan moved the Caped Crusader in an increasingly dark direction — to say nothing of the outright drudgery of Ben Affleck in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” — the Batman character really needed to lighten up a bit. “The Lego Batman Movie” does the great service of taking him down a peg, with a gravel-voiced Will Arnett playing a vain, egomaniacal jerk who doesn’t work well with others and wants to take all the credit for himself. As with all the Lego movies, this one is chockablock with pop culture references and playroom action sequences, but it carries a well-realized theme about the value of friendship and teamwork, and how real heroes don’t have to go it alone.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]‘Velvet Buzzsaw’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Five years after teaming up for “Nightcrawler,” their searing critique of if-it-bleeds-it-leads journalism, the director Dan Gilroy and Jake Gyllenhaal have reunited for the art-world satire “Velvet Buzzsaw,” which arrives on Netflix less than a week after its Sundance premiere. The macabre premise sees an art critic (Gyllenhaal) and an influential gallery owner (Rene Russo) descend on a collection of paintings from a dead artist who had wanted them destroyed. Instead, the paintings are literally destroying the lives of those who are buying and selling them for outrageous fees.‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor?’Starts streaming: Feb. 1For those who grew up watching “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” from cribs and playpens, Morgan Neville’s documentary about Fred Rogers is an insta-cry, tapping into memories from an age before creating memories was possible. But even younger generations should find plenty to appreciate about “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” which paints Rogers as a friendly radical who broke every television rule to speak directly to children. Rejecting all commercial considerations, Rogers held theme weeks on divorce, poverty and death, and offered gentle guidance for his most vulnerable viewers.‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin’Starts streaming: Feb. 6It didn’t seem revolutionary at the time, but when Judd Apatow’s “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” slipped into theaters in 2005, it changed the landscape of studio comedy, introducing a gallery of rising stars and a producer/director whose imprimatur would dominate film and television, and putting a new premium on improv-heavy ensembles and huge comic set pieces. As a film, it’s still a sweet and hilarious upending of the ‘80s-style teen sex comedy, casting Steve Carell as a middle-age bachelor who has yet to be deflowered. Apatow and company would run the theme of arrested adolescence into the ground in the years to come, but the earnestness underpinning Carell’s relationship to his buddies (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) and his more experienced girlfriend (Catherine Keener) counteracts the juvenilia.‘High Flying Bird’Starts streaming: Feb. 8Steven Soderbergh’s latest experiment in iPhone filmmaking takes a stripped-down approach to the wheeling and dealing of professional basketball. Written by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who scripted “Moonlight,” “High Flying Bird” takes place during a lockout that’s draining millions from the sport. André Holland stars as a sports agent who devises an unconventional and disruptive plan around his new blue-chip rookie client. At a time when the real N.B.A. is thriving, Soderbergh and McCraney work to expose the racial and economic dynamics of the league, which favor the priorities and pocketbooks of white owners over the mostly black athletes who drive ticket sales.‘Paddleton’Starts streaming: Feb. 22Another from the Sundance-to-Netflix pipeline, “Paddleton” reunites co-writer and star Mark Duplass and the director Alex Lehmann, who worked together on the stellar coming-home drama “Blue Jay.” Though it addresses the issue of assisted suicide, “Paddleton” is another low-key Duplass production that’s more about relationships than politics, focusing on the bond between a terminally ill layabout (Duplass) and his neighbor (Ray Romano) in a crummy apartment building. The two have to travel a great distance to get the necessary drugs, which gives the film the shambling quality of a road movie, albeit one that pauses frequently to indulge the lifestyle of two middle-age slackers.TV Series‘Russian Doll’Starts streaming: Feb. 1From “Slums of Beverly Hills” to “Orange Is the New Black,” Natasha Lyonne has specialized in playing hot messes, beating back misfortune with acerbic wit and self-deprecation. Lyonne’s highly anticipated new series “Russian Doll,” which she created with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, takes those qualities to dark new extremes, casting her as a panicked young woman stuck in a grisly “Groundhog Day” scenario. Every night she goes to the same New York City party, and every night she dies in some horrific fashion. What lesson is the universe trying to teach her? Presumably the show will have the answer.‘One Day at a Time’: Season 3Starts streaming: Feb. 8One of the benefits of Netflix and its niche-driven programming is that the standard models for successful television shows are thrown out the window and past trends can be revisited. Norman Lear’s original series “One Day at a Time” hailed from an era of socially conscious entertainment that has long since passed. Its Netflix revival, built around a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles, has successfully carried the same spirit into the issues of the day. If the third season is anything like the first two, it will draw laughter and tears from the everyday issues facing a household with two matriarchs: a single mother and nurse (Justina Machado) who suffers from PTSD from her time in the military, and her feisty mother, played by the legendary Rita Moreno.‘Dating Around’Starts streaming: Feb. 14Let’s be absolutely clear about this: It’s likely that “Dating Around” will be a trashy television show, an attempt by Netflix to enter the sordid and inauthentic world of reality romance. That doesn’t mean it won’t be a guilty pleasure. Each episode of “Dating Around” follows a single person through five blind dates, with the hope that one of them will yield a second date. It premieres on Valentine’s Day, for maximum compare-and-contrast to viewers’ real-life love connections.‘Dirty John’Starts streaming: Feb. 14Hosted by the Los Angeles Times reporter Christopher Goffard, “Dirty John” was a popular true-crime podcast for a reason: It tells the bizarre and frightening story of a wealthy middle-age interior decorator who was seduced and nearly destroyed by a violent scam artist. Coming to Netflix shortly after a successful run on Bravo, the TV adaptation loses some of the podcast’s ambience and storytelling economy, but Connie Britton is ideally cast as a big-hearted woman with bad taste in men, and Eric Bana is solid as the fake anesthesiologist who takes advantage. Juno Temple and Julia Garner co-star as her skeptical adult daughters.‘Larry Charles’ Dangerous World of Comedy’Starts streaming: Feb. 15The bearded anarchist of the comedy world, Larry Charles is associated with some of the biggest names in the business. He worked with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David on “Seinfeld” and the David offshoot “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” and directed Sacha Baron Cohen in “Borat,” Brüno” and “The Dictator.” Charles tends to favor acts of guerrilla humor, with lots of room for spontaneity and improvisation, and that sensibility seems quite likely to inform “Larry Charles’ Dangerous World of Comedy,” a four-part series that takes him to far-flung places to discover new talent. The word “dangerous” is key: Charles’s visits to countries including Russia, Iran, Nigeria and Turkey are intended to emphasize the value of laughter as a tool for survival.‘The Umbrella Academy’Starts streaming: Feb. 15Based on Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá’s quirky superhero comic, “The Umbrella Academy” has a grabby premise: In October 1989, 43 women gave birth despite having not been pregnant when the day began. Seven of these special children were adopted by a billionaire and placed in a school designed to develop and harness their powers. The children disbanded as teenagers, but circumstances have brought them back together in their thirties as a dysfunctional surrogate family trying to save the world. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper, Robert Sheehan and Mary J. Blige are among the bigger names in the cast, and its Canadian-American showrunner Steve Blackman brings a wealth of genre experience on shows like “Bones,” “Fargo” and Netflix’s “Altered Carbon.”Also of interest: “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (Feb. 1), “Snow White and the Huntsman” (Feb. 1), U-571 (Feb. 1), “Romance Is a Bonus Book” (Feb. 2), “Jaws” (Feb. 6), “Kevin Hart’s Guide to Black History” (Feb. 8), “The Breaker Upperers” (Feb. 15), “The Town” (Feb. 15), “The Drug King” (Feb. 21), “Chef’s Table”: Season 6 (Feb. 22)."
5c542f4d3a125f5075c0787b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/dealbook/trump-us-china-trade-deal.html,"Good Friday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.“At halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations”President Trump might keep some tariffs on Chinese goods even if Beijing and Washington reach a trade agreement, he told the NYT yesterday, after delegates from both countries wrapped up another round of negotiations.“Without the tariffs, we wouldn’t be talking,” he said in an interview.How were the discussions? According to Mr. Trump’s posts on Twitter, they went well, “with good intent and spirit on both sides.” He hosted the negotiators in the Oval Office and suggested that President Xi Jinping of China was willing to welcome more American companies and to buy more American products — including five million tons of soybeans. The Chinese representatives, led by the American-educated vice premier, Liu He, said that the two sides had made “important progress” and had “candid, specific and fruitful” talks. Robert Lighthizer, the top American trade negotiator, was less sanguine. “We did not come off the rails,” he said. “That’s significant.”What’s next? The two sides hope to reach an agreement by early March, before Mr. Trump plans to increase tariffs after a 90-day truce. Mr. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will go to Beijing after the Chinese New Year holiday this month to prepare for  talks between the two presidents. Mr. Trump said that summit meeting would happen “in the near future” and that it would address “some of the long standing and more difficult points.” According to Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game.” He also used another sports analogy to describe the negotiations:I would now say we are at halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________A reminder to Facebook and Google: Don’t mess with AppleFacebook’s 35,000 employees got a reminder this week of Apple’s power over their day-to-day routines. So did workers at Google.After Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple’s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users’ consent. Apple eventually restored access for both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.The tension with Apple was not Facebook’s only concern.• The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be following the Russian playbook for using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.• Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target of several more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.A Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank merger seems increasingly likelyDeutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it’s looking increasingly probable that the German government will step in to combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.Deutsche reported its first full-year net profit since 2014 today but still failed to meet analysts’ expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.The bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occur by midyear.But that may not be wise, writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:The deal looks like the option of last resort. Combining two of Europe’s most inefficient banks to create an even bigger supertanker would require tens of thousands of job cuts and a risky (read costly) integration to stand a chance of working.Expect ambiguity in the jobs dataThe Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there’s even more uncertainty than usual, writes the NYT’s Ben Casselman. Here’s what to look for:Crucial time: The United States’ decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.Potential impact: There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.Solid foundation: The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, and paychecks are growing.ImageSwitch consoles at a trade fair for video games in Paris in October.CreditBenoit Tessier/ReutersEarnings reports show looming challengesInvestors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.Stiff competition: The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon’s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, as growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace. But the company compensated by expanding its highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Its revenue guidance fell short of expectations, sending shares down sharply in after-hours trading.Seeking a turnaround: G.E.’s fourth-quarter results pointed to the depth of the company’s challenges, despite a strong performance by the company’s jet engine business. G.E. made no forecast for what its profit and revenue would look like this year, and its chief executive, Lawrence Culp, said that 2019 was “still very much a work in progress.” The company also said that it had reached a $1.5 billion settlement in an investigation of its role in the 2008 financial crisis, reassuring investors.More earnings news: Nintendo shares dropped more than 9.3 percent after it cut its full-year target for sales of its Switch video game console.Revolving DoorIntel named its interim chief executive, Robert Swan, as its permanent leader, ending a seven-month search.

5c52e1473a125f5075c07494,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/dealbook/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html,"Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.A surprise shift from the Federal ReserveIn a sharp reversal of the stance it took just week ago, the Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, said yesterday it had “the luxury of patience” in deciding whether to raise rates again, writes the NYT’s Binyamin Appelbaum.The news: The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, a decision that was widely expected. What surprised markets was the indication that rates, which are in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, would stay put for some time.The reaction: Mr. Powell’s comments soothed Wall Street, sending stocks higher, something President Trump cheered on Twitter. But the U-turn puzzled some investors and one warned of a slowing economy.More: In a separate statement, the Fed signaled that it might reduce “quantitative tightening,” the policy of selling its bond portfolio, which could be a challenge for Mr. Powell. Here’s a guide to what’s going on.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________On Facebook, who knows if you’re a bot?Advertisers pay for space expecting to reach potential spenders.Facebook, which says it has access to 2.32 billion people, seems like a prime avenue of exposure. But how many are spammers, scammers or flat-out fakes? Jack Nicas, who explored the social media network’s fluctuating, confusing account estimates, reckons even Facebook may not be sure.Yesterday, the company said in tiny lettering at the bottom of a slide about its earnings that it believes that there are 116 million fake accounts on its site, a 36 percent increase from 2017’s figure, which was itself 359 percent higher than the number disclosed in 2016. Its estimated number of duplicates rose 20 percent year over year, to 255 million.How many unauthorized accounts does Facebook take down each quarter? Enough to encompass as much of 35 percent of the network’s active users, data suggests. And some analysts suspect that the company’s user counts involve more guesswork than it lets on.But the money keeps coming in: Facebook emerged from a string of privacy scandals last year with a 30 percent boost in revenue and a 61 percent upswing in profit. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, confirmed that Facebook plans to integrate the technical infrastructure of its WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger apps by the end of the year or by early 2020.A bot scandal reaches a conclusion: The attorney general of New York reached a settlement with Devumi, a company that sold hundreds of millions of fake followers on Twitter and other platforms before going out of business last year.Is Apple’s Tim Cook Facebook’s privacy watchdog? After determining that the social network had violated the rules of an Apple developer program, Mr. Cook moved to block access. Our columnist Kevin Roose wonders whether Mr. Cook is becoming a technology regulator of last resort.ImageIcicles hanging from a restaurant in Minneapolis.CreditCraig Lassig/EPA, via ShutterstockIt is so cold …The Arctic air mass sweeping across the Midwest and the Northeast brought a deep and sometimes deadly chill that caused traffic to snarl and the ground to crack.It is so cold that shops have closed, restaurants have shuttered and petting farm owners are struggling. Any lasting effect on commerce should be slight, however.It is so cold that, in Wisconsin, beer distributors stopped truck deliveries out of fear that their cargo would freeze solid. Amtrak canceled trains. Six in ten flights into and out of Chicago were canceled. Airlines have waived fees for changing flights. One towing company in Michigan received 40 calls for help in three hours.It is so cold that all of Cargill’s grain plants in the Midwest are closed, some shifts at a Tyson Foods pork plant in Iowa have been canceled and the hog slaughter has paused at a Hormel Foods facility in Minnesota.It is so cold that Disney on Ice has called off a performance in Chicago.It is so cold that General Motors has suspended production at several plants in Michigan because of an emergency appeal by the local utility, overwhelmed with heating demand.It is so cold that Republicans and Democrats are reaching across the aisle in Washington so they can huddle together for warmth. Just kidding.Tech earnings are a mixed bagFacebook had company from other tech firms when reporting its earnings yesterday.Nokia, which now focuses on telecom equipment, warned that it would have a slow start to 2019, though it expects more business from companies building 5G mobile networks later in the year. Samsung, whose operating profit plunged 29 percent amid a decline in demand for memory chips, also said earnings this year might struggle. PayPal disappointed analysts, too, even as its revenue rose.But Qualcomm beat Wall Street expectations and issued a forecast that assuaged some concerns about a weak smartphone market in China. Other companies also had good news.Microsoft, often considered an indicator of the broader market, said that its commercial and consumer businesses were doing well, with revenue and profit increasing more than 10 percent from a year earlier. Its continued shift to cloud computing has placed it within striking distance of Amazon, which leads the field.Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce business, said that its earnings growth sank last quarter and that its revenue, which rose 41 percent, had increased at its slowest pace since early 2016. Executives said that, while “the slowdown of macro might cause concerns in the market,” the company had minimal exposure to the trade war with Washington and e-commerce was healthier than the overall Chinese economy.Tesla, the electric carmaker, reported its second straight quarterly profit, but said that its $139 million in fourth quarter earnings was less than what it brought in during the third quarter. The company expects to deliver as many as 400,000 cars this year, up from 245,000 last year. And it said it had $3.7 billion in cash to carry it through a $920 million bond payment in March.Foxconn shifts course in WisconsinFoxconn, the Taiwanese electronics behemoth, is rethinking its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin with 13,000 jobs, a proposal that was hailed by President Trump. It’s now considering a shift toward research, underscoring the difficult economics of manufacturing in the United States, write the NYT’s Natalie Kitroeff, Patricia Cohen and Monica Davey:That turn runs counter to Mr. Trump’s vision for the project, which he had cited as a milestone in reversing the decline in factory jobs.

The main culprit is uncertainty. Investment in the auto industry plunged last year. The cost of separation is apparent in finance, housing and other areas, too.

5c4eebbb3a125f5075c06ab7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/business/dealbook/us-china-5g-huawei-internet.html,"Good Monday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Huawei and China’s role in 5GThe next generation of computer and phone networks, known as 5G, is expected to connect cities around the world and fuel a future run on robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and other technologies.But it may also rely on an infrastructure vulnerable to hackers and spies, one that the U.S. wants to stop China from building.The Trump administration has conducted a campaign to pressure allies such as Britain, Poland and Germany to banish Chinese companies, especially the telecommunications giant Huawei, from participating in the 5G buildup, according to the NYT:The administration contends that the world is engaged in a new arms race — one that involves technology, rather than conventional weaponry, but poses just as much danger to America’s national security. In an age when the most powerful weapons, short of nuclear arms, are cyber-controlled, whichever country dominates 5G will gain an economic, intelligence and military edge for much of this century.What’s next? President Trump is expected to issue an executive order prohibiting American companies from incorporating equipment originating from China in critical telecommunications networks, extending current rules that apply only to government entities. His administration, which has also waged a trade war with China, says that it is motivated by concern for national security, not just by competitive defensiveness. China’s economic czar, Liu He, will meet with the American trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, in Washington on Wednesday for two days of trade talks, which is likely to cover issues of cyberprotection and the proliferation of state-owned companies.What do officials think? Beijing’s ambassador to the E.U. threatened “serious consequences” if Huawei and other Chinese companies were excluded from 5G projects. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country’s ambassador to China after he said that a senior Huawei executive had “strong arguments” to fight extradition to the U.S.And businesses? Tech manufacturers are diversifying outside China as trade tensions fester and the country’s economy slows. Foxconn and Pegatron, two Taiwanese companies that assemble iPhones, are expanding production capacity in India and Vietnam. American industrial companies with exposure to China have said that their sales there are weakening. But Apple is unlikely to bring production closer to the U.S., where manufacturers struggle to “match China’s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost,” according to the NYT.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Promotions at elite law firm stir diversity debateThe law firm Paul, Weiss is more diverse at its top ranks than most of its peers. But after the announcement of its new partner class, people across the industry began to comment that all of the faces were white, and that only one was a woman’s, the NYT’s Noam Scheiber and John Eligon write.Paul, Weiss has said that it regretted the “gender and racial imbalance” of its 2019 class. But the episode underscores how big law firms are still falling short when it comes to elevating women and people of color.Mr. Scheiber and Mr. Eligon interviewed more than 20 women and people of color who described obstacles to achieving diversity at Paul, Weiss. Many said that opportunities to be groomed for partner were harder to come by for women and minorities.“I fear that African-American partners in big law are becoming an endangered species,” said Theodore Wells, a black partner at Paul, Weiss and one of the country’s most prominent litigators.ImageHoward Schultz in New York in 2016.CreditAndrew Kelly/ReutersHoward Schultz lays groundwork for presidential bidThe former chief executive of Starbucks told Andrew yesterday that he was preparing to run for president in 2020 as an independent.Denouncing the “broken political system,” Mr. Schultz said he had already begun the groundwork to get on the ballot in all 50 states.Long-shot bid: Despite his considerable wealth, Mr. Schultz would face a difficult road. Few independent candidates have mounted significant challenges for the White House.Political jabs: In an interview with “60 Minutes,” Mr. Schultz said Donald Trump was “not qualified to be the president” and that lawmakers from both parties were engaged in “revenge politics.”Swift response: The announcement was condemned by top Democratic operatives, who said they were worried that Mr. Schultz would split votes in a general election.As Lyft’s I.P.O. nears, pressure grows on its C.E.O.Logan Green, the chief executive of Lyft, is known to be reserved, usually letting his second-in-command speak for their ride-sharing service. But now, he’s in a race with Uber to take the companies public, write the NYT’s Mike Isaac and Kate Conger.That means Mr. Green may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role.The back story: Both Lyft and Uber have filed regulatory papers to list their shares on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings are likely to create a bonanza in Silicon Valley.Why it matters: Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.Markets await earnings, Fed guidance and the jobs reportStocks sank at the end of last year on fears of an imminent recession, but those concerns have largely abated, with global markets now rallying at the fastest pace in months. But investors are still cautious ahead of a busy week.The next few days bring an onslaught of quarterly earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla — many of which are considered to be representative of the broader economy. The Federal Reserve is also holding policy meetings this week, which come after central banks in Europe and Japan sounded cautious notes. And on Friday, the monthly U.S. jobs report will be released.The world economy “is not in crisis,” writes Neil Irwin. But, he adds:What the last few months have made clear is that the forces that have held back the global economy for the last 11 years are not temporary, and have not gone away. And that, in turn, makes the world uncommonly vulnerable to a bout of bad luck or bad policy.The work force is still aging. Productivity growth remains weak, as is consumer demand. Low interest rates could constrain central bankers trying to engineer an escape from a downturn. And a “nasty feedback loop” could result in more political dysfunction, leading to risks of economic disruption like the type posed by the recent government shutdown.Speaking of which: After a 35-day stalemate, the government is open again, much to the chagrin of some of President Trump’s conservative supporters. The 116th Congress will consider Democratic wage proposals in the house and a Middle East policy bill in the Senate. Lawmakers may also consider whether to ban future shutdowns entirely.

5c5175b53a125f5075c070f4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/travel/budget-travel-sri-lanka.html,"It’s common while traveling to be approached by locals trying to make a few a bucks by offering to show you around. I typically respond with a polite “no,” but on this particular morning in Kandy, a small city in the center of Sri Lanka, I was looking for someone to take me on a tour of the sights. Santha, a small, middle-aged man with a big smile, must have sensed it, because he made a beeline for me as I approached the small park near the Kandy Municipal Market on Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe Mawatha Street in the center of town.After a quick negotiation we were off, crammed into the back of a blue tuk-tuk, zooming down streets slick from the morning’s rain and smelling of wet leaves. Santha yelled to me over the loud buzz of the auto rickshaw’s engine: “I was born in Kandy, raised in Kandy and married in Kandy.” He added, “And I will die in Kandy!”I could easily have spent months in Sri Lanka, the small island nation off the southern tip of India. Full of fantastic food, kind people and astonishing natural wonder, Sri Lanka is a place best seen slowly, even if you only have four days on the ground like I did. The train was my preferred means of transport (when I wasn’t in a tuk-tuk), winding from Colombo to Kandy, in the middle of the country, before taking another train down to Ella, on what was one of the most beautiful and scenic train rides I’ve ever experienced. And as far as cost goes, I was able to keep my expenses comfortably under control.First, some logistics: A train trip in Sri Lanka requires planning. Many popular routes, including the one from Kandy to Ella, can sell out reserved seats weeks in advance. The Sri Lanka Railways website isn’t going to be much help here: you can only reserve tickets in person or through your local mobile phone. I consulted the website The Man in Seat 61 and eventually decided to place my trust in Visit Sri Lanka Tours to make my bookings.My ticket in the observation car from Colombo to Kandy, with comfortable seats and a big picture window at the front of the compartment, cost 11 British pounds, or about $14 for the two-and-a-half hour ride. (The agency is U.K.-based and charges in pounds, payable through PayPal.) I snagged the last reserved second-class seat on the Kandy to Ella route — this is with booking 20 days in advance — and paid 13 pounds for the more ponderous, nearly seven-hour jaunt through the green hills and tea plantations of central Sri Lanka.The Airtel SIM card I purchased in India didn’t work when I landed at Bandaranaike International Airport on my SriLankan Airlines flight (about $180 for a one-way flight from Chennai, India). Luckily, I had bought an AIS travel SIM card for about $18 ahead of time, which is good for eight consecutive days of travel in over a dozen Asian countries, including Sri Lanka. I can’t speak for service in the other countries on the list, but I had no trouble plugging it into my unlocked iPhone and using it over the next several days in Sri Lanka.Read more about traveling by trainA Meditative Train Ride Through South AfricaOct. 25, 2017I picked up my ticket at Colombo’s Fort Railway Station and had just enough time to stop at the nearby Highland Milk Bar for a quick snack: a creamy chocolate milk from a glass bottle and a bag of chips cost me 120 Sri Lankan rupees, or about 65 cents. The first part of the ride heading east was unexceptional, but things changed around Rambukkana. Suddenly the air seemed heavier, and the vegetation became thicker and denser as we passed each successive train station, painted in muted pastels.ImageRoyal Palm Avenue at the Royal Botanical Gardens, to the west of Kandy.CreditDavid Blacker for The New York TimesPelting rain greeted us as we entered Kandy, once its own independent kingdom on the island until it fell victim to British colonial power in the early 19th century. I put on a poncho I’d brought for the occasion and walked down William Gopallawa Mawatha Street in search of my lodgings. “Gamage?” I asked passers-by, unsure how to pronounce the name of the family who was hosting me. Eventually, someone pointed me toward a fluorescent light inside a small grocery, and I sloshed toward it. A woman peered out the door and waved. “Peterson?” she yelled from across the street.The lovely Gamage family (pronounced GAH-mah-gay), consisting of parents, children and extended family all under one roof, put me up for two nights in their home for about $10 per night, booked through the site Hotels.com. My room was basic but comfortable, and came with an outstanding breakfast spread every morning: curried mango, daal, beans, beets, rice, eggs and tea. Mrs. Gamage told me I could easily find someone in a tuk-tuk to show me around town.When I found Santha the next day near the park (or rather, he found me), we quickly agreed on a price for a tour of the city: 2,000 rupees (a little more than $11). “We have very good history here,” he said to me as the tuk-tuk labored uphill toward Sri Mahabodhi Maha Viharaya Buddhist temple, a little over a mile from the town center. Sri Lanka is a majority Buddhist nation, and many of the culturally and historically significant places of worship are Buddhist.After spending some time admiring the giant statue of Buddha that the temple is famous for (and paying the 250-rupee entrance fee), Santha, our driver and I made a few more stops in the area. Some were clearly an attempt to get me to buy something, but I didn’t mind: At the Pilimathalawa Tea Factory, for example, a quick and interesting tour of the grounds was followed by an elaborate tasting and sales pitch to try to get me to buy tea. When I bought a package of broken orange pekoe tea for 1,200 rupees — which I was going to buy anyway — the salesman immediately said that if I bought a second one, I’d get the third for free. He balked when I suggested he give me one package for 800 rupees, however, and I walked out with my single package of tasty, locally grown tea.ImageTemple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, which draws worshipers to its evening worship ceremony, or puja. CreditDavid Blacker for The New York TimesAfter a visit to a government-run medicinal garden and a stop for a quick beer (100 rupees buys you a local Anchor beer from the supermarket), we zoomed back toward town, Santha narrating as we went along. “Very dirty right now,” he said as we crossed a muddy-looking Mahaweli River. Why would I choose to visit Sri Lanka now, during rainy season? he asked me. I didn’t have a good answer.The Royal Botanic Gardens was the final stop on our tour. Despite the relatively hefty entrance fee (1,500 rupees for foreigners, 60 for locals), I found the gardens a lovely respite from the traffic and hubbub of the area. They seem more like an arboretum than anything else, and I admired mazelike java fig trees, a towering smooth-barked kauri and a fascinating cannonball tree, which holds dozens of large, spherical fruits.The food is wonderful in Sri Lanka; bright flavors, sharp spices and complex curries usually eaten with rice as the centerpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed the Flavors of Sri Lanka cooking class I booked as an Airbnb experience ($22), with the friendly Chitra taking the lead and her daughter Hasara assisting. Learning about the different spices and produce was a delicious and elucidating education, like gotu kola, an herb, and goraka, a small, sharply acidic fruit that’s commonly dried and used to flavor meat and fish.A 400-rupee tuk-tuk ride from Chitra’s house on the western side of town took me to Sri Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (1,500 rupees admission) just in time for the 6:30 p.m. puja, or worship ceremony. Hundreds of people packed into the temple, fragrant with flowers and ringing with the rhythm of drums beaten by men in traditional dress. After the puja, I wandered north along a narrow moat until I came to a man standing in front of an old, regal-looking building. He introduced himself as Vipula, and we chatted about the building, which was the residence of Kandy’s king until the British seized the kingdom in 1815. The king, Vipula said sadly, was betrayed by his own people.After an early breakfast the next morning, I boarded a bright blue train to Ella, a small town southeast of Kandy. Traveling by train is one of my favorite ways to get to know a place: While allowing one to truly have a sense of moving from one place to another, it also creates a sense of community and shared experience with others aboard. From my second-class seat (about $16.50, again booked through Visit Sri Lanka Tours), I could enjoy the percussive clacking of the train as it wound through the intensely lush, hilly terrain, with row after row of perfectly manicured tea plants dotting every slope.ImagePassengers hang from the windows on the train from Kandy to Ella to take pictures and get some air.CreditDavid Blacker for The New York TimesWith tourists and locals hanging out of the doors and windows — some to get a good selfie, others to get some air — we pulled into Ella station. I made the short walk to the Sunnyside Holiday Bungalow, where I had booked a room for just under $30 per night. The owners are kind and the property, with gardens and a big shaded porch, is beautiful. The one downside is that there seems to be a trash processing facility across the road, which can be slightly irksome when the wind blows the wrong way.Ella’s downtown is geared to tourists and backpackers — think Western-style coffee shops, bars and souvenir stores — so I didn’t spend much time there. My first morning in Ella, I set out to find the Nine Arch Bridge, a gorgeous old colonial-era railway bridge that has, as you might expect, nine big arches. I was fortunate to arrive just as a big red and green engine with a few cars behind it came barreling around the bend. After a morning of walking around, it started to pour. I ducked into the restaurant at the 98 Acres Resort & Spa, which sits atop a hill and provides an awesome view of the surrounding countryside, even in the rain. I sipped a cappuccino (400 rupees) and lamented the weather.ImageRows of tea plants dot the landscape along the train route from Kandy to Ella.CreditDavid Blacker for The New York TimesBut an hour or so later, I had my chance. The downpour had eased to a light smattering, and I set out to hike Little Adam’s Peak, a slightly rigorous but very doable trek to the south. It was a bit more difficult after the rain, but the trade-off is that I had it all to myself; I didn’t meet a soul on the way up.Nor was there anyone at the summit. I approached a small shrine that had a covered golden Buddha statue and multicolored prayer flags fluttering lightly, and admired the vista of low-lying clouds resting gently on what seemed like an endless series of rolling, green hills. Even through the rain, it was a spectacular sight.Read more about the Frugal Traveler’s trip to IndiaCups of Tea, Pashminas and Momos, Seeing India’s Himalayas on a BudgetNov. 15, 2018In Kolkata, a Love of Literature, Fried Street Food and, Mostly, SweetsNov. 22, 2018Mumbai, a City Both Uplifting and HeartbreakingDec. 20, 2018An Indian City Bursting With ActionJan. 16, 2019Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

5c5024323a125f5075c06d7d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/travel/surf-camp-tech.html,"Inside one of Surf Simply resort’s three gleaming new glass-walled video-coaching suites, I’m staring at a giant screen freeze-frame of myself taking off into an overhead wave. It is a glorious shot, hair flying, stance low, a white-water trail streaming behind me to the lip of the wave.“So what do we see here, Bonnie?” asks Jessie Carnes, one of the resort’s four owners and my coach for the week. What the screen doesn’t yet show, but what she and I both know: It’s the moment right before I biff the wave and fly face-first into the Pacific.What’s different from every other time I biff it face-first, though, is that this time I can see that both of my hands are coming too far forward into the turn, pitching my upper body toward the water. I say so, and Ms. Carnes rewards me with a radiant grin.“Exactly,” she says, advancing the video so that we see the ensuing fall in real time. “Keep your head up and your hands over the rails” — left hand over the left side of the board, right hand over the right side — “and your weight will stay over the board driving into the turn.”ImageThe pool at Surf Simply resort doubles as a place to improve paddling techniques.CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesIt’s late November here at the brand-new Surf Simply resort in Nosara, Costa Rica, where up to eight cameras were trained on me and the other 11 guests in the water during the morning’s surf session. Within the hour, video footage was loaded onto the resort’s private server and edited into a personal highlight reel, cut with skill-building lessons that are customized for each surfer. The coaches then run through a “theory” session with that surfer, going over the tape and running drills to improve performance.The founder of Surf Simply, Ru Hill, moved here from England and started teaching out of his car in 2007; three years later, he opened the original coaching resort a short distance from Playa Guiones, a four-mile span of white-sand beach featuring some of the most consistent surf in the world. Since then, Surf Simply has become a premier surf destination, one that routinely gets booked out a year in advance. 4 Camps for the Surfing TravelerJune 7, 2016A BuzzFeed Founder’s Costa Rican HideawayMarch 2, 2016Last year, Mr. Hill and his partners — Ms. Carnes, Daniela Acosta and Harry Knight — started building an ecologically thoughtful but technologically sophisticated new iteration of the resort: An intimate, minimalist building tucked under the jungle canopy, bordering the Reserva Biológica Nosara, with a walking path right to Playa Guiones. The four entrepreneurs hired Gensler — the renowned San Francisco design firm behind such projects as the original Apple stores, Facebook headquarters and Seoul Incheon International Airport — to bring it to reality. They officially moved into the new digs a month before my visit.ImagePaddling out and hoping to catch a wave..CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesImageCatching students in action is integral to the training.CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesWith this in mind, I can’t help but think that the new video-coaching room is kind of like being inside an iPhone, one that’s loaded with surf tutorials, raw film footage from all angles and an app for personalized analysis. Welcome to Surf Simply 2.0.Surf Nerds UniteI live in the Bay Area and have been surfing off and on for about a decade, with two babies thrown in there. Like a lot of intermediate surfers, I’ve dabbled in lessons over the years, but I always wondered if there was a better way than the ethereal, “feel the wave” instruction that doesn’t translate to actual skills. Most days, surfing seems to happens in a vacuum; even when you have a dedicated surf posse, as I do at San Francisco’s Ocean Beach, there’s never really a reliable witness to tell you what you did, right or wrong.What sets Surf Simply apart from other surf camps is the extreme specificity of technical instruction, and that’s what my three-woman surf crew — Caroline, Sarah and Harper — and I were after when we planned this trip a year and a half before. Every coaching session relies on a logical progression that instructors call the “tree of knowledge,” a road map of skills that connects the dots from entry-level surfer to competitor (in the spirit of community, it’s available free online to anyone who wants it). ImageIt is the specificity of training that students get from the coaching staff that sets Surf Simply apart. CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesThe daily schedule is posted on a blackboard by the open-air dining room: two-a-day surfs; lectures about surfboard mechanics, wave forecasting, etiquette and duck-diving; stretching classes by Andreina Poletti, an impossibly fit and plucky sports conditioning coach from the capital city of San José. All of it is punctuated with fresh, creative meals by the supremely gifted Denis Madrigal, who has worked in some of New York’s most storied kitchens, including the Palm. Oh, and did I mention the massages, the pool and the open bar?“It’s as if the N.F.L. postgame practice met your honeymoon and they had a baby,” Caroline mused on the third morning as we walked back from the beach, surfboards in hand, adjusting pace as little crabs the fiery red of stop signs scuttled across our path.

By The New York TimesThe ideal audience for this data-driven approach to surfing includes Trevor Ault, 43, a mechanical engineer who was visiting Surf Simply for the third time with his wife, Paige Morgan, 46, a commercial real estate broker. “Seven hundred and 65 calories,” he said proudly, showing me the morning’s readout on his surf app. The GPS and gyroscope inside his smartwatch helped map the zigzag course of his various wave trajectories, tallying the ones he made and the ones he didn’t, and recording wave speed, distance, time and energy expenditure for the entire session (impressively high, thanks to the effort required to paddle over the six- to eight-foot waves that morning). Data, he reminded me, is your friend.I also met Tiffany Joh, 31, a professional golfer on the L.P.G.A. Tour. Six years ago, she was coming off her worst season on the tour and lost her tour card. Before starting the uphill climb to requalify, she took a week off from golf and learned to surf. She now visits Surf Simply during every off season to improve her skills.ImageStudents can choose their surfboards and then store them in the board room. CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York Times“Surfing and golf are similar in that they are so frustrating: You’re waiting for 95 percent of the time, but then you’ll get one really good wave or hit one really good shot, and you’ll feel amazing,” she said, laughing. “They’re also both very technical. Golf is about reading slopes on the greens, matching speed with your line. There’s creativity in how you do that, but you need the technical fundamentals first. Same with surfing: You need the fundamentals before you can get creative and ‘feel the wave.’”I think about how much golf and ski magazines are devoted to improving your skills, whether it’s putting or backcountry safety. Then I think about surf magazines, which are almost entirely devoted to pretty aquamarine pictures of waves with awesome surfers on them. Here in Nosara, you have the chance to live inside that pretty picture, with the technical tools to help you belong there.Treading LightlyEverything about the resort itself enables this flow to and from the ocean, with an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living. Guests can select any surfboard they like from the board room, a spacious, teak-beamed shed, and place their picks on racks under little chalkboards marked with their names. The beach path is adjacent to the board room, and three outdoor showers are situated right at the steps back up to the resort’s pool and hot tub. Each guest room is designed for the surfer returning from a session; the generous glass-walled shower has numerous hooks inside and out, to hang rash guards and suits.ImageA guest room at Surf Simply. At least half of the resort's energy is supplied by a rooftop solar system.  CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesOne morning in the pre-dawn hour, I appreciated the unexpected juxtaposition of jazz piping out of the dining room with the raawrerRAAAWRrerroarerrawer of howler monkeys in the trees 15 feet overhead. Later, I saw one howler curled up into a tiny ball on a branch above the pool, and marveled at what a big sound a little monkey can make.The entire operation will be platinum LEED-certified and tries to have a light footprint. Nearly half its energy needs are supplied by rooftop solar, and wastewater is used for irrigation, eliminating sewage output and saving more than 50 percent in public water use over the previous resort. Mr. Hill and his team are also relaunching their children’s surf camp, offering free lessons and video coaching every Saturday morning to encourage local children to join the beach community. One student from the original children’s camp is about to come full circle, returning to Surf Simply as a newly hired 21-year-old instructor.ImageSurf Simply coaches use videotape to help provide stop-action feedback to their students.CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesA week at Surf Simply starts at about $4,500 per person, double occupancy ($3,500 if your partner doesn’t surf), including lodging, food, drinks, massages, photos and video footage and transport to and from the airport. How does one justify the cost of professional coaching as a nonprofessional? Here, I think again about golf and skiing — greens fees alone can top $2,000 for seven days, and what of lessons, lift tickets, gear, lodging, meals and all the rest? Caroline, Harper, Sarah and I decided that amortizing the cost of happiness over a lifetime of surfing makes the trip more than worthwhile; we’d have loads of new skills to take home with us to practice, and surfing on our home break costs nearly nothing. By and large, though, people keep coming back for more: Mr. Hill said that 37 percent of guests are return visitors, many of whom come back in the company of those they’ve met here. One all-star guest, Reid Winkler, an orthodontist from Seattle, had traveled to Surf Simply a record 12 times and already had his next two trips scheduled. “I’ve made a lot of good friends here,” he told me. “It’s the school for surf nerds — but it’s the coolest nerds you’ve ever met.”ImageA coach and a student going over the finer points of mastering a surfboard. CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesBruce and Abby Hutchinson, from New London, N.H., were on their fourth trip to Surf Simply. Before their first visit, in 2015, they had never been surfing. “We love to try new things,” said Mr. Hutchinson, 63, said. They liked the thrill of riding waves, and they also liked the effort to demystify it. “Here, the objective is not to just stand up on the board, but to get better every time.”“It’s the cumulation of sound instruction in skills and the confidence to work on something new, with the group cheering you on,” added Mrs. Hutchinson, 62. “That’s really special.”It was during Ms. Carnes’s breath-hold lecture — lying down in the stretching room with friends both new and old, entering the third minute of holding my breath while pretending to be held under by a giant wave — that it came to me: This was the ultimate Venn diagram of surfing and geekery. And I had never felt more at home.Bonnie Tsui is a writer based in Berkeley, Calif.

El domingo 20 de enero de 2018, una turba irrumpió a la fuerza en un pequeño conjunto residencial en Ibarra, una ciudad ecuatoriana a dos horas de la frontera con Colombia, para desalojar a inmigrantes venezolanos. Daniel García, un comerciante venezolano de 25 años que vive ahí, recuerda que la muchedumbre gritaba: “Mátenlos, hijueputas, asesinos, les vamos a sacar la madre”.Esos ataques fueron el clímax de un fin de semana enrarecido por la violencia y la xenofobia en Ecuador. El sábado 19 de enero, un vídeo donde se veía a un hombre asesinando a puñaladas a una mujer embarazada, había conmocionado al país. La noticia se propagó en redes sociales con un detalle incendiario: el asesino era venezolano. En este reportaje, expertos y testigos analizan el auge de la violencia contra los migrantes venezolanos, alimentada por mitos y prejuicios que muchas veces son reproducidos por funcionarios ecuatorianos para esconder otro tipo de problemas estructurales.• Las visas humanitarias en México: un imán para la nueva caravana migrante. Después de la llegada de varios grupos de personas que se dirigen a Estados Unidos, el gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador ha agilizado los procesos para atender a migrantes centroamericanos y les ha ofrecido empleo en un intento por responder a las medidas de Washington que restringen su paso.La nueva caravana migrante que se dirige desde Centroamérica hacia México es la más numerosa hasta el momento‚ con más de doce mil personas; algunas de ellas dicen que se quedarán en México, al menos por ahora. Sin embargo, muchas otras afirman que de todos modos planean tratar de ingresar a territorio estadounidense.• Los escándalos de Flávio Bolsonaro amenazan las promesas anticorrupción de su padre. Tan solo tres semanas después de haber comenzado su mandato, una serie de episodios cuestionables ha provocado que Bolsonaro, quien llegó al poder denunciando el privilegio elitista, enfrente acusaciones de que su gobierno es más de lo mismo.El desafío más grande para el gobierno de Bolsonaro es un caso que involucra a su hijo Flávio, que es senador. Recientemente, a petición del primogénito del presidente, un juez del Supremo Tribunal Federal de Brasil suspendió una investigación en torno a cientos de miles de dólares en transacciones financieras realizadas por un asistente de Flávio Bolsonaro.“Es la política de siempre. No veo la diferencia con otros gobiernos”, dijo Manoel Galdino, director ejecutivo de Transparência Brasil, un organismo de vigilancia.Opinión: Zoé Valdés“La Revolución se apoderó de todos los aspectos de la vida de Cuba, incluso de cómo se llamarían los años. Mi biografía sigue la línea del tiempo de una Revolución que muy pronto pasó de utopía a pesadilla”.La escritora Zoé Valdés hace un recuento de su vida y establece un paralelismo con diversos aniversarios de la Revolución cubana. Valdés dice que el exilio ha sido un consuelo porque en su país no ha experimentado otra cosa que la tiranía y el terror como legado político de los Castro.Una instantánea: En el nombre del amorImageAgnieszka y Honorata en su hogar, después de un día de trabajo; noviembre de 2013CreditAnna Liminowicz/InproHonorata y Agnieszka han luchado por su amor desde 2011. Apostar por tener una familia ha sido un desafío religioso —ambas son católicas— y político porque son de Polonia, un país conservador donde no pueden casarse y el auge del nacionalismo de derecha las ha expuesto a la intolerancia. Ahora viven en el Reino Unido y la fotógrafa Anna Liminowicz se ha dedicado a captar la alegría y las dificultades de su relación en el proyecto Between the Blocks [en inglés].En el mundoImageMujeres afganas hacían fila en la provincia de Herat para votar en una elección parlamentaria en octubre.CreditHoshang Hashimi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images• Las mujeres afganas temen que la paz con los talibanes pueda desatar una guerra contra ellas [en inglés]. Nadie necesita convencer a las afganas sobre la necesidad de acabar con el derramamiento de sangre que ha enlutado a su país. Ellas han enterrado a demasiados esposos, hijos y hermanos, pero la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses les causa mucho temor. Ven a los occidentales como sus protectores, no solo de los talibanes, sino también de la “mentalidad talibán”.“En muchas ocasiones el gobierno afgano les ha asegurado a las mujeres que sus derechos no se verán afectados negativamente después de un acuerdo de paz con los talibanes”, dijo Saira Sharif, una poeta y política afgana. “Pero las mujeres no participamos en las anteriores conversaciones con los talibanes y es necesario que tengamos un lugar en el futuro del país. Hemos recorrido un largo camino para conseguir los derechos que tenemos y no podemos perderlos después del acuerdo de paz”.• Un nuevo documental revive la teoría de la conspiración sobre la propagación del VIH entre la población negra de Sudáfrica [en inglés]. Un grupo de cineastas decidió investigar a una milicia sudafricana acusada de orquestar el accidente aéreo de 1961 en el que murió el secretario general de las Naciones Unidas, Dag Hammarskjöld.Fruto de sus pesquisas es el documental Cold Case Hammarskjöld, en el que se revela una acusación impactante: un antiguo miembro de la milicia afirma que esa organización usó vacunas falsas a principios de la década de 1990 para propagar el VIH, en un intento por eliminar a la población negra. “Estábamos en guerra”, dijo el exmiliciano Alexander Jones. “En Sudáfrica los negros eran el enemigo”. Sin embargo, los científicos tienen serias dudas sobre esa afirmación debido a la enorme complejidad que exige aislar y preservar el virus.Arte contra la discriminaciónImageLas Bibliotecas Públicas Móviles de ColombiaCreditBiblioteca Nacional de Colombia• Las bibliotecas más importantes del mundo no son necesariamente las más bellas y vanguardistas, como es el caso de la magnífica biblioteca Oodi en Finlandia, una edificación que alberga una colección de cien mil libros. En este trabajo, Jorge Carrión pasa revista por diversas iniciativas, móviles y adaptables, que luchan contra la discriminación, la violencia y la pobreza a través de la lectura, el estudio y el arte.“La arquitectura física la puede pagar el dinero, pero es más difícil comprar la estructura emocional”, afirma Carrión. “Las mejores bibliotecas del mundo tal vez no estén alojadas en edificios impactantes, no tengan impresoras 3D ni aparezcan en los telediarios; pero sin duda están haciendo un trabajo por sus comunidades comparable o mejor que el de las bibliotecas nórdicas”.• Hace tres años, Spike Lee no asistió a los Premios Oscar en protesta contra lo que, a su juicio, son las omisiones de la academia al premiar a los artistas negros. Este año fue la Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas la que llamó a Lee porque su película El infiltrado del KKKlan fue nominada a seis Oscar.“Me encanta estar en este punto con el filme: somos la apuesta improbable de ganar y me gusta estar en esa posición. Nunca he sido el favorito. Nunca. Y puedes citarme: somos el caballo negro de la carrera. En todos los sentidos”, dice Lee en esta entrevista, en la que habla de la industria del cine “y el caos de este mundo de locura” en el que vivimos.• La historia de una exposición queer censurada en Brasil que publicó el año pasado Ernesto Londoño, corresponsal de The New York Times en Sudamérica, es uno de los reportajes nominados a los Premios GLAAD que reconocen a los medios por “representaciones justas, exactas e inclusivas” de la comunidad LGBTI.Londoño analizó la polémica muestra cuya clausura y posterior reinaguración generó una gran controversia que puso en debate los derechos de la comunidad y las amenazas a la libertad de expresión en Brasil.Los beneficios de ‘no molestar’ImageCreditGetty Images• La dicha de poder desactivar las notificaciones de nuestro celular no tiene que incluir la ansiedad de perder una llamada o un mensaje de texto importante.

5c4855dc3a125f5075c05d7a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/dealbook/trade-talks-us-china.html,"Good Wednesday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks in peril?Negotiations between Washington and Beijing seemed to be in a precarious place on Tuesday, after the FT reported that the Trump administration had canceled meetings with Chinese vice ministers.The officials had offered to come to Washington to prepare for meetings scheduled later this month between China’s trade czar, Liu He, and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, the FT said.Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, denied the report to CNBC. He added that negotiations would only be successful if the Chinese honored their commitments:“Promises are great but enforcement is what we want — things like deadlines and timetables and full coverage of the various structural issues. Will this all be solved at the end of the month? I don’t know. I wouldn’t dare to predict.”China may agree to buy up to seven million tons of American wheat. But Chinese officials are reportedly chafing at U.S. requests for regular reviews of changes to their trade policies. And two influential American business groups still see reason to be unhappy, saying China is engaged in “a deep, concerted and continuing effort” to establish dominance in technologies such as robotics and electric vehicles.Beijing is also trying to play down Belt and Road, its vast infrastructure initiative spanning Asia, Europe and Africa: Senior government officials have avoided the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the NYT reports.The effects of trade tensions continue to spread. The stock market started the year strong but sputtered on Tuesday. Japan’s exports last month sank the most in more than two years. Chinese finance officials promised more stimulus. Experts are predicting that “the good times are over” for American companies reliant on Chinese consumers.But not everyone is complaining: Lobbyists have enjoyed a surge of business from companies and trade groups hoping to influence the Trump administration’s tariff decisions. Indonesia’s doing all right, too: Its industry minister says it’s exporting more steel to the U.S. and also attracting Chinese textile and footwear companies.Other Chinese news: The founder of a Nanjing-based meat supplier, one of several Chinese executives at Hong Kong-listed companies who have mysteriously disappeared in recent years, returned to his family. Several Chinese companies are circling Japan’s largest operator of oyster restaurants.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________On Day 33 of the shutdown, some movementThe Senate descended from the spectator stands to plan two competing votes to fund the government on Thursday. One involves President Trump’s latest proposal: $5.7 billion for a border wall, now accompanied by temporary protections for certain immigrants. The other, from the Democrats, would open the government until Feb. 8.But neither is expected to draw the 60 votes needed to advance. This means that the Trump administration is likely to continue as a one-ring circus, focused on the wall to the exclusion of other presidential duties.Here are ways the shutdown is still straining the system:• Reserve security workers are being flown into airports, because as many as one in 10 transportation security officers are failing to show up for work.• Delays in reports about home sales, construction, trade and manufacturing threaten to create a data vacuum, just as the economy may be slowing down.• SNAP food stamps help feed some 40 million Americans. The Agriculture Department is still considering how to keep the program running after February.• The U.S. court system will need to close after Feb. 1 if the stalemate continues.And a sidelight on the wall proposal: Details disclosed at the trial of the drug lord known as El Chapo suggests it wouldn’t have inconvenienced him very much.ImagePhilipp Hildebrand, the vice chairman of BlackRock, in Davos, Switzerland.CreditArnd Wiegmann/ReutersA brave front in Davos masks fears of global downturnAnalysts and bankers at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, offered a glass-half-full attitude toward the global economy, saying it was weakening but not entering a recession. “We’re slowing, but we’re still growing,” said Philipp Hildebrand, vice chairman of the investment manager BlackRock.But behind the brave face, concerns of political paralysis, frayed trading partnerships and working-class resentment created a nervous atmosphere.Another theme was the growing discomfort with corporate influence over society. Nowhere was this tension greater than in the conversation around Big Tech. Optimism in official sessions appeared to be out of touch with the public’s concern about the technology’s disruptive effects on privacy and politics.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, made a surprise appearance and was seen with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia. But talk was dominated by who wasn’t there, most notably President Trump.Instead, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil has been present to take up the populist mantle, the NYT’s Mark Landler writes, promising to root out corruption, roll back regulations and make his country a good place to do business:Mr. Bolsonaro’s keynote address set the tone for a Davos gathering shorn of its usual retinue of American and European leaders, wrestling with political forces, from Latin America to Europe, that are starkly at odds with this conference’s ethos of global cooperation and a liberal world order.Singapore: a haven for Brexit runaways?Dyson, the British appliances company founded by a vocal supporter of Brexit, swears that its decision to move to Singapore is not a reaction to Britain’s planned departure from the E.U.But with one proposed exit plan summarily rejected and the prospect of a delayed divorce, the temptation to jump ship to calmer, more business-friendly waters is growing.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, has asked for a parliamentary vote on whether to hold a second referendum on Brexit.Brexit could hit European consumers hard, Kasper Rorsted, the chief executive of the German sportswear maker Adidas, told CNBC. And the E.U. says trade rules would require a “hard border” between Ireland and British-controlled Northern Ireland if Britain leaves without a deal.Germany and France are still keen to show their commitment to a united Europe: Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron met on Tuesday to renew a 1963 treaty on the subject.Koch Industries backs metal-printing start-upDesktop Metal announced today that it had closed a $160 million funding round to expand the production of its office-friendly metal 3D-printing technology.The funding round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies, the investing and innovation arm of Koch Industries, and brings Desktop Metal’s total investment to $438 million. In a news release, the company declared this to be the moment when 3D printing begins to disrupt traditional metal manufacturing.“We are at a critical juncture in the advancement of metal 3D printing and additive manufacturing,” said Ric Fulop, a co-founder and the chief executive of Desktop Metal, which is based in Burlington, Mass.The production system is the fastest metal printing press for mass production, the company said, and will begin shipping commercially in the first quarter of 2019.Revolving doorJustin Gmelich, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs and one of the most senior executives in the bank’s fixed income business, is retiring.

5c3f1daa3a125f5075c04afb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/dealbook/brexit-defeat-britain-may.html,"Good Wednesday morning. Breaking: Sears and Edward S. Lampert have reached $5.3 billion deal that would keep its stores open for now. Want this by email? Sign up here.An uncertain future for Britain after a staggering defeatPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain suffered a crushing defeat yesterday, after Parliament rejected her plan to withdraw the country from the European Union.The result thrusts the country further into political chaos 10 weeks before it is scheduled to leave the bloc, write Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry.The response: Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called the defeat “catastrophic.” The European Union said it was stunned by the defeat but said there was no option to renegotiate. “Time is almost up,” said the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker.The markets: The uncertainty of a deal will weigh on investors. Analysts say some sectors will be especially sensitive, including homebuilders, commercial real estate, banking, retail and leisure.What’s next? Mr. Corbyn called for a no-confidence vote, which will be debated today. The measure is expected to fail, but Mrs. May has little time to regain momentum, and must present new plan by Monday.Lawmakers may opt for a softer exit, the FT’s Robert Shrimsely writes:The fear will be that Britain is now careering towards a no-deal Brexit, but in fact Tuesday night’s vote may yet prove the high-water mark for the Brexit hardliners. Having thrashed Mrs May’s plan they must now watch her reach out towards Remainers. A softer Brexit or even no Brexit at all, now looks more likely than the no-deal they crave.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________“Talking ourselves into a recession”The partial government shutdown has been marked by theatrics. Democrats spurned an invitation by President Trump to a lunch of steak and potatoes at the White House. Legislators marched across the Capitol to confront a top Republican — who was not in his office. Kraft Heinz announced that it would distribute free food to federal workers.But as the stalemate enters its 26th day, economists are warning that the damage is real and growing, writes Jim Tankersley. The Council of Economic Advisers said that each week of the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points as furloughed employees and contractors sit idle, steadily scaling back their spending.Business and consumer confidence — already burdened by signs of slowing global growth, trade tensions with China and the waning effects of the 2017 tax overhaul — could suffer. With no end to the standoff in sight, the economy could slip from what appears to be the strongest year of growth since the financial crisis into a stall, or worse. According to Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup:“Right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession.”Other shutdown news:• The Trump administration said it would call tens of thousands of employees back to work, without pay, to prepare for the tax-filing season, oversee air travel safety, and sell oil and gas drilling leases.• Unpaid federal workers said that they deserved to be paid immediately for working during the shutdown or be allowed to take jobs elsewhere. A federal judge disagreed.• The Liberty Bond program appealed to Americans’ sense of patriotism to raise funds during World War I. Two Republican lawmakers hope a similar tactic would pay for a border wall.ImageCreditGeorge Frey/ReutersSacklers tied to plan to hide OxyContin riskMembers of the Sackler family, which owns the company that makes OxyContin, were accused in court documents of being directly involved in efforts to mislead doctors and patients about the dangers of the painkiller.The evidence, revealed a Massachusetts lawsuit filing, appears to tie the Sacklers to decisions made by the company, Purdue Pharma, about the aggressive marketing of OxyContin, Barry Meier writes. The promotion of the drug helped set off the opioid epidemic.The Sacklers are one of the richest families in the U.S., with much of their wealth derived from OxyContin sales. In a statement, Purdue Pharma, rejected suggestions of wrongdoing by the company or members of the Sackler family.Apollo nears $10 billion deal for ArconicApollo Global Management is close to a deal to buy Arconic, an aerospace-parts maker, for more than $10 billion, the WSJ reports.The news: Apollo would pay $21 to $22 per share for Arconic, which has a market value of about $9.3 billion. The price would represent a premium of 5 percent to 10 percent above the closing price of Arconic’s shares on Tuesday. The deal is likely to be announced this week.The back story: Several buyout firms have shown interest since last summer in acquiring Arconic, which was formed from the break up of Alcoa in 2016.The context: A deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in recent years and another sign of a thaw in debt markets. Last week, Targa Resources became the first issuer to sell junk bonds since November, ending a 40-day stretch without a high-yield bond sale.A proposed media deal lands another in a tangleA takeover bid for Gannett could complicate its pursuit of Gizmodo Media, which owns Deadspin and Jezebel as well as its namesake technology website.The news: Gannett is a serious bidder for Gizmodo Media in an auction that has also drawn attention from the owner of Gawker.com, the WSJ reported, citing anonymous sources. Univision put Gizmodo Media up for sale in July.Why it’s complicated: In an open letter to the Gannett board, MNG Enterprises, a major Gannett shareholder, offered on Monday to pay $12 cash per Gannett share. MNG which is owned by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital, accused Gannett of damaging the company’s financial position by making several “aspirational digital deals” that haven’t paid off. It demanded that Gannett postpone all digital acquisitions and hire bankers to review strategic alternatives.Bank earnings show weakness in the economyFourth-quarter results released on Tuesday by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo pointed to concerns about the credit and housing markets.• Revenue at both banks missed Wall Street’s estimates, and both announced underwhelming loan growth. At JPMorgan, commercial and industrial loans increased 1 percent, down from 4 percent in the prior quarter. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the bank will pull back lending even more if necessary, saying, “We are not going to be stupid.” Wells Fargo said its mortgage originations fell 28 percent year over year.• JPMorgan said its revenue from fixed income trading declined 16 percent from a year earlier, mirroring a similar slump reported on Monday by Citigroup. But net interest income, the gap between earnings from loans and payouts to depositors, rose 10 percent for JPMorgan and 3 percent for Wells Fargo.• Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are to release their own reports today.• In the airline industry, United Continental beat expectations as fourth-quarter revenue soared 11 percent. The airline said its earnings for this year could be as high as $12 per diluted share. The results lifted the shares of United and rival airlines alike.ImageAndrea Orcel in 2013, when he was the head of the Swiss investment bank UBS.CreditJustin Tallis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSantander balks at price tag for new C.E.O.Andrea Orcel, a top investment banker who seemed set to become the chief executive of Banco Santander, is now without a job.Santander decided not to pay him more than $50 million in deferred compensation Mr. Orcel was owed by his previous employer, UBS.Ana Patricia Botín, the bank’s executive chairwoman and part of the family that controls the lender, said that Santander had underestimated how expensive it would be to hire Mr. Orcel.Santander, she said, had to “balance the respect we have for all of our stakeholders — the millions of people, customers and shareholders we serve — with the very significant cost of hiring one individual, even one as talented as Andrea.”Revolving doorAdam Moss said he would step down in March after 15 years as editor of New York magazine.

5c3c4f993a125f5075c04402,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/arts/television/conan-obrien-tbs-show-reboot-half-hour.html,"On Oct. 4, 2018, Conan O’Brien hosted the latest episode of “Conan,” his long-running TBS late-night talk show. Then he didn’t come back with a new episode the following week, or the week after that, and he hasn’t for more than three months.This was all by design: On Jan. 22, “Conan” will return to TBS with a new look and a different format. Some of the changes to “Conan,” which airs Monday through Thursday nights, will be immediately evident: a new set, no more desk and no more house band. Most notably, the show’s running time has been cut from an hour to a half-hour.Some of O’Brien’s extracurricular activities during his broadcasting break — projects he unveiled at the end of 2018 like a live tour, a podcast and a new installment of his stand-alone “Conan Without Borders” travel specials — have helped inspire modifications at the TBS program. They’ve also become brand extensions, providing more sources of revenue as the TV show shrinks.While some of these changes were designed to keep “Conan” competitive in the crowded late-night field, O’Brien hopes they will also help the program capture more of the unpredictable comic energy he’s been chasing from the moment he succeeded David Letterman as host of NBC’s “Late Night” in 1993.When he looked back on himself in those earliest broadcasts, O’Brien told me on Friday, he said he saw a performer attempting to fulfill competing desires. “We’re trying to be anarchists, but I’m trying to be a good boy and do a good job for the network,” he said. What he’s engaged in now, he said, “is this gradual progression toward me making the job fit me more — what do I like?”Over breakfast in Los Angeles, O’Brien talked about the decision to restart “Conan,” the changes to the show and what might come next for him in his evolving TV career. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.How does it feel to be so near to resuming the show, after being away for a few months?My analogy is, in surgery, when they have to stop your heart so they can operate on you, there’s that weird moment when the doctor must be like, all right, time to start the heart up again! What if it doesn’t start? What if I walked out on the first test show and just started openly weeping? But we’ve done two test shows so far and it feels really good.When did you first have the idea to take a break from the show and reconceive it? Last year, I was coming up on 25 years as a late-night host. It made me realize, wait a minute, really? I remember when Johnny Carson retired, it was 30. At the time, that was such a big part of the story, that someone had had a television show for 30 years. It just struck me that the miles do add up. The repetition can get to you after a while. I was the new guy for so long, and then that card flips overnight — you go from the inexperienced, nervous punk to the old dean emeritus. I started to think, does it have to be that way? Let’s say I’ve got a couple years left in me. What if I tried to, in the most selfish way possible, alter this so that I have a maximum amount of fun? I decided to scare myself.What led you to these other activities — the live tour, the podcast, the travel shows?I had done a tour before, but this was no bells and whistles. I started out thinking, I need like 10 minutes up front. Then that became 15, then that became 20, then that become half an hour. By the end it was 40 minutes. It was really liberating.The podcast was suggested to me as, well, that’s a cool space and you might do well in it. It sounded a little strange, and then we tried one where I just interviewed some of my writers, and I loved it. The travel shows opened up my eyes, too, because they’re completely outside the realm of anything I do. They can be frightening because they take away a lot of control. I’m out there, I don’t often know what I’m going to encounter.What did you take away from these experiences that you could put back into the TV show?The big thing I wanted to do was pull the audience closer and make it like a cool, fun place to do comedy that you might find in Los Feliz or that the Upright Citizens Brigade might have. I wanted it to have a little bit of that compressed feeling, and I like having the audience right there. It feels less presentational in the old-school way.Is that why, for example, you got rid of the traditional host’s desk and won’t be dressing in a suit and tie anymore? ImageThe new half-hour “Conan” will be less traditional, with no desk and no band. “We’ve done two test shows so far and it feels really good,” O’Brien said.CreditJake Michaels for The New York TimesI grew up revering the format, and then over time, you think, what’s feeling like it’s vestigial? I really don’t miss the desk. It started to feel like I’m doing someone’s taxes. None of my guests are wearing suits. I look fine in a suit, and I will wear a suit sometimes. If one of the Obamas stops by, or when Trump comes, as he inevitably will, I’ll wear a suit. The most successful things that we’ve ever done on YouTube are me wearing my Indiana Jones-as-archaeology teacher look. And people accept that.What about reducing the show to a half-hour? Was that a business decision?There were arguments on both sides. Among the guys in rooms that crunch numbers, it’s controversial. You sell a lot of ad time in an hour — you sell half as much in half an hour. This is where this joint-venture idea evolved: We can scale back the show, but we can make Turner partners. We can develop not just my podcast, but the travel shows and these specials with other comedians. I like to use the Rockefeller oil industry as my model. The octopus, if you will, that strangles America.Does it feel like a blow to be doing a half-hour show when there are still so many other hourlong shows out there?It would if I hadn’t been around this long. It also would if there weren’t shows like “The Daily Show,” and Sam Bee and all these other shows. I know when I’ve been feeling like we’re padding out the show because I’ve got to get to the full hour. When I know that the part of the show that has the real protein and that people really want, happened in the first half-hour — literally the first 21, 22 minutes.Do you still have flexibility within that half-hour?We can go long. We might have stuff that I want to try, and we shoot it and it could go in a different show. I might shoot whole extra acts afterward that I just put online. There might be nights where I do an hour of content. TBS gets the half-hour version and some of that other half-hour either goes into a different show or is consumed in a different way.So in your first relaunched show, if you feel like having a longer conversation with Tom Hanks, you can?First of all, here’s my strategy with Tom Hanks: rudely interrupt. I know the real Tom Hanks. And he needs to be rudely interrupted. He’s a very cruel man in real life.Do these changes affect the creative process of the show?I’ll give you an example. An alarm bell, to me, is when the post-mortem meeting feels like drudgery. We’ve been doing it after every show since the beginning. We all get together in my dressing room and we go through the show act by act. This is how much we’re over, this is how much we’ve got to edit. This is what worked, this is what didn’t. How come that bunny puppet didn’t blow up when it was supposed to? We had it down so cold that people were on their iPhones. We all go in there, slumped down, yeah, yeah, yeah.And now?The post-mortems on these two test shows? It’s like a knife fight in there. It’s, “This was way too long, how do we cut this?” “Wait, that felt weird.” “Well, I didn’t think it felt weird.” “I don’t like the way this looks.” “I like the way it looks.” It’s turbulent and there’s conflict and I like it. It’s Lenin’s Politburo versus Brezhnev’s. One is lots of angry disagreement and the other one is like, uhhh, grain production, and everyone knows this has got another five years anyway and then it’s going to fall apart but we’ll be dead so who cares. These are terrible analogies, by the way.You’ve referenced the idea of finality a couple of times now. Even though you’ve got plenty of life left in you, do you feel like you’re somehow setting up for your final act?I’m never going to have a better farewell show than I did on “The Tonight Show.” I loved that show and so I feel, in a weird way, I had my farewell show. I did it. I died, and talked to my grandfather and saw the light and was called back. This concept that I must be the king of late night, I don’t even know what that means anymore. I don’t know who that is anymore. It’s an outmoded concept. I’ve come to realize that there’ll come a point where it’s just not even thought of as late night: “Oh, you make that stuff that makes me laugh.”Is this how you want to go out, with a show that gets smaller and smaller until it’s gone?Maybe that’s O.K. I think you have more of a problem with that than I do. [Laughs.] At this point in my career, I could go out with a grand, 21-gun salute, and climb into a rocket and the entire Supreme Court walks out and they jointly press a button, I’m shot up into the air and there’s an explosion and it’s orange and it spells, “Good night and God love.” In this culture? Two years later, it’s going to be, who’s Conan? This is going to sound grim, but eventually, all our graves go unattended.You’re right, that does sound grim. Sorry. Calvin Coolidge was a pretty popular president. I’ve been to his grave in Vermont. It has the presidential seal on it. Nobody was there. And by the way, I’m the only late-night host that has been to Calvin Coolidge’s grave. I think that’s what separates me from the other hosts.I had a great conversation with Albert Brooks once. When I met him for the first time, I was kind of stammering. I said, you make movies, they live on forever. I just do these late-night shows, they get lost, they’re never seen again and who cares? And he looked at me and he said, [Albert Brooks voice] “What are you talking about? None of it matters.” None of it matters? “No, that’s the secret. In 1940, people said Clark Gable is the face of the 20th Century. Who [expletive] thinks about Clark Gable? It doesn’t matter. You’ll be forgotten. I’ll be forgotten. We’ll all be forgotten.” It’s so funny because you’d think that would depress me. I was walking on air after that."
5c6557bb3a125f5075c09ae6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-chase.html,"Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.Say hello to JPM CoinJPMorgan Chase this morning announced the first cryptocurrency to be rolled out by a major U.S. bank.How will it be used? The new tokens, each of which represents a U.S. dollar, will help settle some payments between the bank’s clients. CNBC reports that the new digital coin will enter testing “in a few months.” It will facilitate a “tiny fraction” of its wholesale payments business.What’s the point? “Money sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,” Umar Farooq, the head of JPMorgan’s blockchain projects, told CNBC. “Is there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.”It also gives JPMorgan first-mover advantage. This will be one of the world’s first real-world crypto applications for banking, and the biggest move into the sector yet by an American lender. It also sets the bank up for a future in which crypto could be an integral part of the financial sector.The bank has come a long way on crypto. Its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, famously declared Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017 and said he would fire any employee caught trading it. (He later regretted his comments and added that he believed in the value of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies.)The threat of a government shutdown fadesCongress is expected to vote on a bipartisan border deal this evening that would ward off another government shutdown.President Trump may be resigned to signing it. “I don’t want to see a shutdown,” he told reporters yesterday. “A shutdown would be a terrible thing.”A lot of people need to be persuaded. Congressional leaders acknowledged that the bill doesn’t allow for the wall that Mr. Trump and his allies want. (White House aides spent yesterday pitching the legislation to the likes of Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity.) But it assigns more money to border fencing and immigration detention than left-wing Democrats would like.Still, no one sees a better option. “As with all compromises, I say to people, ‘Support the bill for what is in it,’ ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters yesterday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned his colleagues against letting “unrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process.”It’s not done until Mr. Trump puts pen to paper. CNN reminds us that he backed out of a previous compromise at the last minute, triggering the longest-ever government shutdown. This time, he could try to find further border funding from elsewhere in the government to claim some sort of victory.The U.S.-China trade talks get seriousAfter three days of what Reuters calls “deputy-level meetings” in China, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, will embark on high-level trade negotiations in Beijing today.China is stepping up. The U.S. officials will meet today with Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser. According to the South China Morning Post, Mr. Xi himself may attend tomorrow.So far, it’s unclear what progress is being made. President Trump has said only that discussions are “going well,” adding that Chinese negotiators were “showing us tremendous respect.” Beijing has offered few details.But a deadline extension could help. America is scheduled to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent if a deal isn’t reached by March 1. Mr. Trump has said he might let that slide; Bloomberg puts the possible deadline extension at 60 days.Europe fights the U.S. over ‘dirty money’Relations between Washington and Brussels soured yesterday after the E.U. added four American territories to a blacklist of money-laundering regions, Jack Ewing and Alan Rappeport of the NYT write.On the list: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands joined an ignominious group that includes North Korea, Libya, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. European banks must apply greater scrutiny to any transactions in those areas.The E.U.’s rationale: “Dirty money is the lifeblood of organized crime and terrorism,” Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, said yesterday. “It was high time for Europe to act.”The Trump administration’s response: The Treasury Department condemned the list as flawed and unnecessary, and complained that it “was not provided any meaningful opportunity to discuss with the European Commission its basis for including the listed U.S. territories.”Where things get tricky: “The deteriorating relationship between the longtime allies will complicate a resolution on trade,” the NYT notes. “Talks between the European Commission and the White House are on the back burner while the Trump administration focuses on resolving its trade war with China. But trade talks are expected to intensify in the coming months.”ImageAn Airbus A380CreditChristof Stache/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAirbus will stop building its giant jumboAirbus will cease production of its A380 passenger jet, Amie Tsang of the NYT reports:• “Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jumbo jetliner in 2021, although it said it would continue to support existing A380s.”• “The decision will lead to job cuts at Airbus, possibly as many as 3,500 over the next three years, and Airbus said it would start discussions in the next weeks about the consequences for its work force.”• “The A380 “was built for a time when crowded airports would demand that planes carry more people to reduce congestion. But flight traffic instead shifted to smaller planes, which are cheaper to maintain, flying to regional airports, a move that reduced demand for larger aircraft.”Was an Apple insider-trading lawyer insider trading?Federal authorities yesterday charged Gene Levoff, a former senior director of corporate law at Apple, with illegally trading on inside information, according to Dai Wakabayashi of the NYT:• “The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff violated insider trading laws three times from 2015 to 2016. On one occasion, Mr. Levoff sold roughly $10 million of Apple stock — nearly his entire holdings — from his personal brokerage account four days before Apple announced quarterly earnings on July 21, 2015.”• “The company’s stock price fell 4 percent after the earnings report, in which Apple revealed it had fallen short of analysts’ estimates for iPhone sales. Mr. Levoff had already seen a draft of the announcement and avoided about $345,000 in losses by dumping his Apple shares before the official announcement, the S.E.C. said.”• The S.E.C. said Apple cooperated with its investigation, and that Mr. Levoff was placed on leave in July and fired in September.• A lawyer for Mr. Levoff said in a statement, “Gene Levoff was a trusted Apple executive for many years, and has never before been accused of wrongdoing of any kind.”ImageCreditDaniel Leal-Olivas/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBrexit remains a messThe state of negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. is still divided and confused, and Brussels doesn’t like what it sees.British lawmakers still don’t like Theresa May’s plan. They will debate and vote today on a series of amendments to her proposal. The main focus: a bid to rule out leaving without a deal. (Mrs. May insists that remain an option.)Britain’s opposition party, Labour, is divided. “Moderate Labour MPs are plotting to form a breakaway political party within weeks,” the FT reports, if their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, doesn’t back an amendment calling for a second referendum on Brexit.Surprise! Europe remains unimpressed. “E.U. leaders are still waiting for a signal from British Prime Minister Theresa May on the next steps in negotiating a critical divorce deal,” the WSJ reports. “In the meantime, they are losing confidence in her capacity to deliver a majority in her own parliament for any agreement.”More Brexit news: Britain so far has rollover arrangements for only about £16 billion, or $21 billion, of the £117 billion in E.U. trade deals it benefits from. Potential chaos could cause a surge in market abuse, according to a British financial watchdog. Switzerland will set quotas on British immigration in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Banks are merging faster. Should they?Analysts and investors think that BB&T’s proposed $28 billion takeover of SunTrust will spur a wave of bank consolidation. Such mergers would probably be completed more quickly than in the past, thanks to recent changes at the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Lalita Clozel of the WSJ writes.How much faster? “The median time the Fed takes to approve or reject a bank merger receiving opposition from community groups — common in large deals — dropped to 3.8 months in the first half of 2018, from 5.6 months in the first half of 2017 and 7.0 months for all of 2015, according to a Fed report,” Ms. Clozel writes “At the O.C.C., the average time for handling all mergers dropped to 1.9 months in 2018, from 2.6 months in 2016, the agency said.”What changed? The Fed and the O.C.C. now review deals differently. One example: The O.C.C. says previous enforcement actions aren’t necessarily red flags that could kill a transaction.Banking deal makers are happy. “We were very pleased with the efficiency of the regulatory approval process,” said Kessel Stelling, the C.E.O. of Synovus, whose deal to buy FCB Financial Holdings won Fed approval in just four months.Others are not. Community groups, who usually press merging banks to increase lending in underserved areas, think they’re being sidelined.

Sign up here.Breaking down the speechIn his 82-minute address last night, President Trump cited U.S. economic growth and his efforts to keep it up, while attacking opponents in a speech that ostensibly called for unity in Washington. Here are the highlights for the business world:Mr. Trump defended his economic record. He took credit for America’s robust economic health — a key message for his 2020 re-election campaign — and assailed critiques of his administration’s efforts, including tax cuts and loosened regulations. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said.He kept pressure on China. Mr. Trump promoted his administration’s trade battle with Beijing, saying, “We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.” Talks between Washington and Beijing over a compromise are continuing.And he painted his potential rivals as socialists. As Democratic presidential contenders promote policies like Medicare for all, Mr. Trump tried to paint them as peddlers of dangerous ideas. “Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said.What didn’t he talk about? “Trump’s speech was notable for what he did not mention, including the ballooning federal debt, once a centerpiece of the Republican agenda; nor did he talk about Social Security, Medicare or other entitlements,” Philip Rucker and Toluse Olorunnipa of the WaPo write. Democrats fought back. Stacey Abrams, the party’s nominee for Georgia’s governorship last year, focused on “outlining the party’s vision for lower health care costs and a more inclusive immigration policy, and pressing her case that access to the voting booth should be easier, not harder.”Goldman may shrink its onetime trading powerhouseSteep cuts could hit Goldman Sachs’s commodities arm, which once generated huge profits for the firm, Liz Hoffman of the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources.What may happen: “Executives are discussing pulling back from trading iron ore, platinum and other metals, and are ordering cost cuts to the sprawling logistics network that handles the transport and storage of physical commodities,” Ms. Hoffman writes.The context: The business was once one of Wall Street’s most envied money makers. But such trading has suffered in recent years, thanks to changing markets and tighter regulations. And Goldman’s current C.E.O., David Solomon, cut his teeth as an investment banker and is focused on operations like lending and asset management.The symbolism: “By taking a knife to the business, Mr. Solomon is sending a message down the ranks that nothing is sacred,” Ms. Hoffman writes.ImageCreditJohannes Eisele/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhy are stocks rising on mediocre earnings?In recent weeks, several companies — including Ford, G.E., JPMorgan Chase and Wynn Resorts — have missed Wall Street forecasts, only to see their stock prices rise. It’s a classic relief rally, writes Matt Phillips of the NYT:• “Stocks of companies that have reported their results have risen by an average of 1.1 percent, the largest post-earnings jump in a decade.”• “With the Federal Reserve backing off plans to aggressively hike interest rates, more investors view the market’s downturn last year as overdone. And they are giving rousing ovations to corporate results just because they’re not as bad as they could have been.”• “Analysts said that the current tendency in the markets to see the glass as half-full reflects widespread relief among investors that a recession and a sharp slump in earnings are not in the cards any time soon.”• “Some analysts said that stocks could keep climbing as the market’s rock-bottom expectations keep getting surpassed.”• “At the same time, there is a danger that the stock market’s rise could paper over the genuine problems for the economy that are popping up in fourth-quarter results.”A peek inside Wisconsin’s disastrous deal with FoxconnWhen the Chinese electronics manufacturer Foxconn decided to set up shop in the Midwest, President Trump hailed the move as “one of the great deals ever.” But Bloomberg Businessweek, which interviewed 49 people familiar with the project, reports how badly the effort has gone.The plan was to create a high-tech manufacturing hub. It was to be led by a Mount Pleasant plant housing a large chunk of Foxconn’s LCD TV production. “As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire, and grow than right here in the U.S.,” Mr. Trump said at the time, promising that it would create as many as 13,000 jobs.But manufacturing hasn’t taken off. “LCD components weren’t made in the U.S.A., according to sources familiar with the operation,” Austin Carr of Businessweek writes. “They were shipped from a Foxconn factory in Tijuana. The Wisconsin plant was only handling the last steps of assembly.” He adds that “during 2018, the company tried and failed to produce its own LCD materials at scale in Wisconsin so it wouldn’t have to import them from Mexico.”Nor has pay or recruitment. “Pay at the factory started at about $14 an hour with no benefits, much less than the $23 average Foxconn promised. Many people weren’t hired full time,” Mr. Carr writes. “Last fall, the company’s hiring targets began dropping internally,” he adds, with Foxconn importing foreign staff for some roles.Tracking the biggest public company? Good luckKeeping hold of the title of most valuable American company is proving to be difficult, Stephen Grocer of the NYT writes:• “The positions of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker’s stock price late last year.”• “The mantle has changed hands seven times among the three companies. Three of those switches have taken place over the past week as the big tech companies reported quarterly results.”• “The competition reflects the global economic concerns hanging over the markets as well as the changing technology landscape, and it’s a shift from past years.”Blankfein vs. Sanders over stock buybacksA bill introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders to limit companies’ ability to buy back stock drew outrage from many in the corporate world — and tempted Goldman Sachs’s former C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein to tweet for the first time in nearly seven months.Mr. Blankfein’s take: “A company used to be encouraged to return money to shareholders when it couldn’t reinvest in itself for a good return,” he tweeted. “The money doesn’t vanish, it gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs. Is that bad?”Mr. Sanders’s retort: The senator shot back that a buyback, “increases the wealth of billionaires” like Mr. Blankfein. “Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea?”More buyback news: SoftBank of Japan plans to spend $5.5 billion of proceeds from the listing of its telecommunications arm to repurchase stock.ImageCreditJ. David Ake/Associated PressTaxpayers paid almost $1 million a day for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago tripsThe Government Accountability Office has published a report of the president’s travel expenses, which show the cost of his visits to his Florida holiday home:• From Feb. 3 to March 5 in 2017, Mr. Trump spent portions of 14 days at the holiday home. The G.A.O. said that those trips had cost a total of $13.6 million, or just less than $1 million per day.• The costs included travel and accommodations, Secret Service expenses and bomb detection. Almost $60,000 was paid directly to Mar-a-Lago.• The Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Gary Peters, who requested the report, said the findings provide “a snapshot of the tens of millions of dollars President Trump spends to travel to his Palm Beach resort — all at taxpayer expense — including government funds that are paid directly to a business in which the president himself has a financial interest.”Revolving doorAngela Ahrendts will step down as Apple’s retail chief in April after a five-year run.

Guatemala anunció ayer el término unilateral del acuerdo con Naciones Unidas, vigente desde 2006, para establecer una Comisión Internacional contra la Impunidad en el país centroamericano (Cicig), pese a que el mandato del grupo debía mantenerse hasta por lo menos septiembre de este año. El secretario general de la ONU afirmó que el programa seguirá y organismos de la sociedad civil presentaron amparos ante la Corte de Constitucionalidad, aunque el gobierno de Jimmy Morales no siempre ha acatado sus fallos.“Agoté todos los procesos diplomáticos y actué de buena fe, pero no he visto esa buena fe del otro lado”, dijo Morales en referencia a la Cicig, cuya finalidad es ayudar al Ministerio Público a combatir la corrupción. En sus años de funcionamiento, la Cicig ha apoyado en investigaciones de alto perfil como la que vinculó al expresidente Otto Pérez Molina y a su vicepresidenta a desfalcos aduanales, que forzó la renuncia de ambos y los llevó a prisión, donde están ahora. Más recientemente, la Cicig sugirió investigar a Morales y a familiares suyos por posible financiamiento ilícito de campaña.ImageAlgunas personas esperan en fila para cruzar hacia McAllen, Estados Unidos, desde Reynosa, México, el 5 de eneroCreditMeridith Kohut para The New York Times• Las consecuencias de la obsesión por el muro: trabas políticas y más dinero para los contrabandistas. “Honestamente, no quiero cruzar de manera ilegal, pero no tengo opción”, dijo un hombre hondureño que terminó por recurrir a coyotes en su intento por llegar a Estados Unidos. Es uno de los miles de ejemplos de cómo la política migratoria de Donald Trump ha mejorado el negocio para los contrabandistas; en ciudades fronterizas como Reynosa, México, el aumento de las dificultades para solicitar asilo ha hecho crecer la demanda por traficantes de personas, que llegan a cobrar hasta 7000 dólares por cruzar a una persona al otro lado del río Bravo.La promesa de Trump de construir un muro fronterizo, eje rector de su discurso migratorio, se ha topado justamente con cada vez más muros. Trump exige destinar fondos para la obra a pesar del rechazo rotundo de los demócratas, que ahora controlan la Cámara de Representantes.

5c595eb83a125f5075c080d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/travel/galapagos-overtourism.html,"“The archipelago is a little world within itself,” a young Charles Darwin mused in his London study in 1839. Four years earlier, the aspiring naturalist had spent five weeks on the Galápagos Islands, some 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. So taken by the “extreme tameness” of the species he encountered, he wasn’t an ideal visitor by today’s standards: He hopped on the backs of giant tortoises and “pushed a hawk off the branch of a tree” with the muzzle of a gun.These days, that “little world” is brand-name nature, drawing an increasing number of visitors from around the world to see, among other creatures, blue-footed boobies, marine iguanas that swim alongside equatorial penguins, and the giant tortoises for which the islands are named. In 2017, 241,800 people visited the islands, according to the Observatorio de Turismo de Galápagos, up from 173,419 a decade earlier. Much of the growth — more than 90 percent from 2007 to 2016 — is from land-based tourism: visitors who fly into airports on the islands of Baltra and San Cristóbal, check into hotels and take à la carte tours that are considerably cheaper than the expensive cruises that traditionally are how most visitors have seen the islands. With round-trip flights from Quito costing as little as $400 or so, and hostel accommodations starting at $20 a night, the Galápagos Islands are no longer just for upscale travelers.ImageSally lightfoot crabs on Fernandina Island.CreditJosh Haner/The New York TimesFor the Galápagos National Park, which uses a portion of the $100 fee that visitors are required to pay ($6 for Ecuadoreans) to oversee the 97 percent of the islands that hasn’t been settled by humans, land-based tourism offers much-needed funds. But that doesn’t mean conservation groups — including Unesco, which lists tourism growth as one of the primary threats to the islands — aren’t alarmed by the lack of an enforced cap on land-based visitors. (Cruise passengers, on the other hand, are limited by the space available on expedition ships; last year, there were some 70 ships with room for about 1,700 passengers.) More people on the islands means more pressure on existing infrastructure, encroachment on animal habitats and a heightened risk of introducing invasive plant and animal species.  “It is simply not sustainable to have never-ending growth in land-based tourism in this fragile environment,” said Jim Lutz, the president of the International Galápagos Tour Operators Association, who expressed the same sentiment in a letter to Ecuador’s tourism minister last February. On a recent visit to the islands, I observed land-based tourism in action, and spoke to naturalists, guides and others about the effects of the travel boom, which, along with climate change, illegal — and legal — fishing and other threats, make the Galápagos a microcosm of conservation’s modern challenges.

By The New York TimesOn The GroundAlong with more visitors, the islands’ permanent population (now about 30,000) has also swelled. About half of those residents — many from mainland Ecuador who were drawn here by the tourism business — are in Puerto Ayora, on the island of Santa Cruz. In some ways, the town seems like any other tropical locale, with coffee shops, cafes and stores selling T-shirts; there is even a bit of a party scene when the sun goes down.On an overcast Friday night in Puerto Ayora, I sat with Ulf Torsten Hardter, an environmental manager turned guide, on the patio of OMG Galápagos, a cafe with a life-size statue of Darwin sporting a Santa Claus-like beard, popular with the selfie set.ImageThe Galápagos National Park asks visitors to stay six feet away from animals, but the request is often ignored. Above, tourists and sleeping sea lions on a beach in the park.CreditAdam Popescu for The New York Times“The problem is that the islands lack basic infrastructure like waste, energy, water,” Mr. Hardter said over an iguana-branded I.P.A. As we talked, the misty rain called garúa started, and one of Darwin’s finches scavenged from my unfinished plate.Mr. Hardter, who is originally from Germany, came to the islands in 2006 to build a solid waste recycling center with the World Wildlife Fund. Today that center processes all of Santa Cruz’s plastic and organic waste. With the influx of so many people, more environmentally responsible ways of dealing with everything from long-term waste disposal to drinking water are needed, Mr. Hardter said. Later, I strolled past a fish market where a 16-foot marlin dangled from a hook, and sea lions, pelicans and frigate birds nudged iPhone-wielding tourists. A relative lack of predators and a curious public have made these animals fearless — and bold. More than once I saw someone get too close to a sea lion, which barked in displeasure — even, in one case, chasing a couple of tourists away. (In the national park itself, visitors are told to stay six feet away from the animals. Those rules, I was told, are routinely ignored, and my own observations bore this out.)Not far from the market, Avenida Baltra is lined with mom-and-pop stalls serving ceviche and marinero soup, and kiosks where tour operators hawk day trips geared to cost-conscious visitors. Most of these advertised eco-friendly specials; just how eco-friendly is difficult to verify. More on the challenges facing the GalápagosAs Seas Warm, Galápagos Islands Face a Giant Evolutionary TestDec. 18, 2018In the Footsteps of Charles DarwinJune 20, 2017Sometimes, these options are, by their very nature, the least impactful. You can visit highland jungle trails, coffee plantations or the twin volcano craters called Los Gemelos, all just outside town. Prices range from a few dollars for a cab ride to a couple of hundred for a day on the ocean in an outboard motor boat or small yacht. Or you can rent a bike for about $15 and explore a paved road that cuts through a semiarid landscape to forest. A few miles away in the sleepy town of Bellavista, off a dirt road on a private farm, there are lava tunnels sculpted by years of magma flow. White pickups double as taxis and charge a dollar to take you anywhere in town, even for D.I.Y. jaunts.I went on one of those jaunts, getting dropped off at the edge of town where Avenida Baltra heads uphill and into the highlands. I was in search of tortoises, but instead I saw yapping dogs and fences protecting corn and cattle, all of which disrupt migratory routes of the tortoises. Hours later, tired and wet, I boarded a bus for 50 cents. Staring out the window, I finally saw giant tortoises on the side of the road — I lost count after a dozen — many being fed by tourists (another thing that is discouraged, but nearly impossible to enforce).ImageGalápagos tortoises on Isabela Island. In some areas, human habitation has disrupted the migratory patterns of the animals.CreditJosh Haner/The New York TimesWhere you sleepWhere you spend the night is another indicator of change and the stratified options offered to visitors. Though the Observatorio de Turismo de Galápagos claims there are currently limitations on the number and size of new hotels, accommodations have increased dramatically over the last decade — from 65 to more than 300 — with prices running from backpacker rates to over $900 a night. I stayed in a standard room at the Ikala, an affordable lodging just a few steps from Puerto Ayora’s marina. Many hotels have eco-friendly features, or at least claim to. At the Ikala, solar panels heat the showers and light the garden.Across the bay, one of the island’s oldest hotels (and most costly — a suite recently ran about $800 a night) is Finch Bay, which feels like a slice of Malibu and takes its eco-friendly services seriously. An on-site treatment plant desalinates brackish seawater, a greenhouse supplies the kitchen and all fish is bought from locals. In 1989, Finch Bay’s parent company helped establish the recycling-center project Mr. Hardter worked on years later.Renato Vasconez, the quality manager at Finch Bay, said that all the hotel’s wastewater is treated before it is released. A new filtration system will boost production when completed later this year (the hotel already provides potable water to neighboring properties that the municipality cannot reach).Finch Bay’s adjacent beach is white sand, but that’s only because staff clean it every day. “You can’t imagine how much trash we find,” Mr. Vasconez said. “The microplastic is the worst.” Beaches on the Galápagos are public, and the masses litter, he said (and, indeed, I saw bits of green plastic that looked like kelp). Mr. Vasconez told me that he regularly found dead frigate birds wrapped in fishing nets. “It’s something that gets me very angry,” he said.ImageA sea turtle in the waters off San Cristóbal Island.CreditJosh Haner/The New York TimesOn the WaterA boat is needed to get to nearby islands, so even land tourists may end up spending time on an expedition vessel operated by Lindblad or Quasar Expeditions. They aren’t cheap — a week can run several thousand dollars — but the advantage is that you get the expertise of top naturalists employed by the cruise lines. Providers like Quasar are also plastic-free and support the national park and organizations like the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galápagos Scouts, organizations whose researchers work to preserve the species that attract foreigners. Lindblad sponsors similar work, something smaller operators can’t afford. Lindblad, Quasar and other expedition cruises, are typically all-inclusive. Last-minute deals run as much as 30 percent off. The alternative is taking a day trip on smaller vessels from Puerto Ayora that cost as little as $100. The trade-off is that you’re generally on the water only a few hours, and the price might just cover gas (food and snorkeling or diving are often negotiated individually). Expedition ships also have permits to visit islands that many of the day cruises do not. “You get what you pay for: the quality of the guide, level of English, food, boat,” said Dominic Hamilton, a deputy tourism minister turned magazine editor. “The animals and islands are the same; the options aren’t.”I decided to splurge on a Quasar cruise, which departed from Baltra and took me and about 30 passengers to several islands over the course of a week. Alex Cox, a veteran Galápagos-born guide with nearly three decades of experience and an encyclopedic love for nature, pointed out volcanoes and blue-footed boobies, and expounded on the complexity of the Galápagos every morning over a mug of hot water with lemon.On a blustery morning, Mr. Cox and I were snorkeling off the islet of Genovesa. Something darted through my legs and I surfaced with an uncontrollable laugh: It was a sea lion. Bobbing at the surface, I noticed three fishing boats with gear I later learned was illegal. Although it is legal for these fisherman to catch tuna and other fish in much of the Galápagos Marine Reserve, Mr. Cox told me that the type of lines the fishermen were using could accidentally snag and harm or kill sea lions, sharks and turtles. Later, Sofia Darquea, president of the Galápagos Naturalist Guides Association, told me about the dangers of illegal fishing practices. If the marine life goes, she said, so go the birds and reptiles, and so, too, the tourists. “The national park doesn’t have enough working boats to monitor what’s going on here,” she said.ImageMarine iguanas and a lizard off Fernandina Island.CreditJosh Haner/The New York TimesThe fact that only a fraction of the marine reserve — the waters surrounding the national park — are off-limits to fishing, had to be the most confusing thing I heard during my visit. I knew that the government faced pressure from local fishermen, and that there had been incidents of violence in the past. But shouldn’t all of this land — and the surrounding sea — be off-limits? Wouldn’t that protect this place for years to come?""These marine populations are being depleted,” Enric Sala, a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, said. “If Ecuador wants the Galápagos to continue to be a unique place that attracts visitors from all around the world, and brings in hundreds of millions of dollars every year and supports tens of thousands of people, then they have to make a decision. Otherwise, the Galápagos risks going from being a unique place to being a very common place like so many others that have been destroyed through short-term interests.""Failed photo-op On my last night in Puerto Ayora, I walked along the marina and stared across the water. Baby white-tipped sharks swam in schools at the water’s edge.A squawk turned my head — it wasn’t wildlife, but rather a young woman in a North Face jacket and Birkenstocks who was having what seemed like an argument with an uncooperative sea lion. Instead of posing for a snapshot, the sea lion kept advancing on the interloper, perhaps expecting to be fed instead of filmed. I watched as an opportunistic Galapageño approached.“Don’t worry,” he said. “If you want to get real close for a good picture, we can go to North Seymour island for the day. Just $200.”The woman looked at her companion, a young man in a tie-dye shirt who shook his head.“$100,” the Galapageño bargained. “On my boat, we’ll spend the whole day on the island.”The sea lion waddled off the pier and splashed off into the water. The woman’s eyes trailed after the departing mammal.“Is the boat eco-friendly?” she asked.The operator smiled. “Of course,” he said. “This is the Galápagos.”Adam Popescu is a Los Angeles-based writer.

5c7cf78c49f0eacbf105b32f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/modern-elder-resort-silicon-valley-ageism.html,"EL PESCADERO, Mexico — At a luxury resort in Baja California Sur, everyone was recovering from a long day sharing how hard it felt to be getting older.Some of the participants walked pensively along the Pacific Coast at sunset. Others read from the resort bookshelf, choosing from sections labeled: “What can death teach me about life?” and “What are the unexpected pleasures of aging?”The next day, the group would place stickers with ageist slurs all over their chests, arms and faces, and then hurl the stickers into a fire. Later, there would be healing sessions focused on intergenerational collaboration and accepting mortality.That some of those on retreat were in their 30s and 40s did not strike them as odd.The resort, called Modern Elder Academy and located in El Pescadero, Mexico, opened in November. Guests don’t check in and out as at a traditional retreat; they submit “applications” for one-week programs and, if accepted, pay “tuition” of $5,000 to secure a room and three locally sourced meals a day.Modern Elder was started by a hotelier turned Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and it is aimed at workers in the digital economy — those who feel like software is speeding up while they are slowing down, no matter how old they really are. Tech is a place where investors are wary of funding any entrepreneur born before Operation Desert Storm, where Intel is under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for age discrimination, where giants like Google and IBM regularly face the specter of class-action lawsuits from workers north of 40.In and around San Francisco, the conventional wisdom is that tech jobs require a limber, associative mind and an appetite for risk — both of which lessen with age. As Silicon Valley work culture becomes American work culture, these attitudes are spreading to all industries. More workers are finding themselves in the curious position of presenting as old while still being — technically, actuarially — quite young. And Modern Elder sees a business opportunity in selling them coping workshops, salt-air yoga and access to a shaman.ImageWhen he was 52, Chip Conley’s young colleagues at Airbnb started referring to him as “the elder.” He resigned himself to the concept, and opened the resort last year.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesCome to Baja, the sales pitch goes. It’s hard getting old, especially when the elder years start at 30.‘People feel irrelevant younger’Chip Conley was surprised when he first realized his colleagues saw him as old. It was 2013, and he was 52. A longtime hotelier — he had founded the Joie de Vivre boutique hotel chain in 1987, and had a string of iconic properties to his name — he had taken a job at Airbnb, the San Francisco start-up fast upending the hospitality industry.His younger co-workers, with their zippy metabolisms and surplus collagen, started referring to him as “the elder.” Mr. Conley — who in his 20s started San Francisco’s best party motel and is a longtime Burning Man and local night-life fixture — was a little confused but resigned himself to the idea.“We are all elders in the making,” Mr. Conley said. “If you’re 40 years old and surrounded by 25-year-olds, you’re an elder.”What was hardest, though, was the loneliness. He was the oldest person he would see at work for days. “It can feel strange,” he said.As Airbnb grew, and his stock vested, Mr. Conley decided to start a new hotel with a simple premise: Embrace the term “elder.”ImageThe resort, in Baja California Sur, is built around a grand Mexican hacienda.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesHe found a plot of land about 40 miles north of Cabo San Lucas and set to work. He remodeled a house — a grand Mexican hacienda with big wooden doors, a fountain and a courtyard. There are 18 rooms, several arranged around a pool, and the kitchen, living room and a long outdoor wooden table are communal. It all sits on a bluff overlooking the beach.As Mr. Conley began bringing friends south to test the experience, he imagined that his resort’s core demographic would be 45 to 60. But after announcing a public opening last fall, he was surprised to field interest from people in their 30s. In the nine Modern Elder sessions he’s hosted to date, the oldest participant was 74, the youngest was 30, and the average has been 52.“People feel irrelevant younger, especially in places like Silicon Valley,” Mr. Conley said. “But they’re going to live longer, so there’s excitement and bewilderment. And everyone is wondering, ‘What do we do now?’”‘I’m approaching 50 at a software company’In November, a group of 16 people, ages 37 to 67, traveled to El Pescadero to be the first Modern Elder class. I tagged along.In a van heading down an unpaved road to the facility, Cheryl Crippen, a 50-year-old clinical psychology professor, was worried. “I said before coming down, ‘I don’t do woo-woo,’ and my mom was like, ‘Don’t drink the Kool-Aid and get in a Jim Jones situation,’” Ms. Crippen said. “But I wanted a week to think. I’ve got 40 years left. What’s next? There’s always got to be something next, right?”She told her students she was going on a business trip.Mr. Conley, who is lean and sinewy, with a shaved head and bright blue eyes, greeted everyone at the doors in a tank top and flip-flops. The shaman blessing ceremony would be Tuesday morning, he said, and there was an option for private sessions that he highly recommended. (These involved sitting on a cliff and screaming.) Ms. Crippen looked nervous but put her bags away.Image“The social narrative is basically, midlife is a crisis and after a crisis you have decrepitude,” Mr. Conley said. “But you actually are much happier in your 60s and 70s, so why aren’t we preparing for that?”CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesThat evening, the group had beer and white wine on the veranda. Attendants lit bug candles for the mosquitoes, and I asked a few of the guests why they had come.“I’m approaching 50 at a software company,” said Tracy Stevens, 48.“All my colleagues are 30, and I’m almost 40,” said Margareet Paauwe. “Marketing used to be about feeling. Now it’s all data and I have to speed up with the data. So I do feel older.”Those in their mid-30s today came of age on the cusp of the digital revolution. Many older Millennials didn’t have internet at home until high school, didn’t join social networking sites until college, and didn’t get an iPhone until they had already begun their careers. The arrival of Generation Z into the workplace is showing Millennials what a true digital native looks like.Their anxieties are well founded. In Silicon Valley, the hiring rate seems to slow for workers once they hit 34, according to a 2017 study by Visier, a human-resources analytics provider. The median age of a worker at Facebook, LinkedIn and SpaceX is 29, according to a recent analysis by the workplace transparency site PayScale.At Modern Elder, several people introduced themselves by rounding up their ages — one woman said she was “soon to be 39,” another was “almost 42,” and a third was “pretty soon looking at 50.” Some said they chose to come south because they thought vacationing would be more serene without 20-somethings in the mix.“I wasn’t having to think, ‘Oh, this is going to be a fashion show every day,’” said Libby Wann, 38. “It’s relaxing to know I’ll be with a group of older folks. There’s less to prove.”ImageGuests don’t check in and out as at a traditional retreat; they submit “applications” for one-week programs and, if accepted, pay “tuition” of $5,000.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesDinner was meaty pasta: Modern Elder is not a health/detox retreat. Pretty soon, a majority of the group was yawning.“For those thinking it’s 11 — I’m tired! — actually, it’s just after 8 o’clock,” Mr. Conley said. He wanted them to know that here, early bedtimes were cool. “Baja midnight is at 9 p.m.”The void between baby shower and funeralOn the second day of the retreat, at 7 a.m., everyone gathered in the living room, where the tables were covered in white lilies.“We as a society do a really good job helping people through transitional times: quinceañera, graduation, wedding, baby shower,” Mr. Conley began. “But between baby shower and funeral? Nada. What we’re going to do now is create a midlife atrium.”We took turns giving emotional check-ins. Mr. Conley shared a recent cancer diagnosis. Ms. Crippen talked about a cat sanctuary she runs at her home. Others talked about divorces. A few joked about being unsure if they’re in menopause.Each elder got a binder with the week’s curriculum. Thursday, there would be a session on Millennials. This was illustrated with a young man with groomed facial hair holding a disposable coffee cup.Image“I feel like I’m just not getting it,” said Modern Elder’s Jeff Hamaoui. “I watch YouTube stars and all these things, and intellectually I get it, but emotionally I just can’t connect.”CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesOne handout was a rainbow chart showing a life span. It began at “growth mind-set” (0-15 years old), illustrated by an egg. It went to “embodied elder” (65-85), illustrated by a butterfly. After that was just a flower — the elderflower.“The flower of a human,” Mr. Conley called it. He added that elderflower juice is quite healthy.Some of the attendees said their friends had been confused by the word. “People interpret ‘elder’ as you’re old, you’re senior,” said Lorenzo Jones, 55, an executive coach. “‘Time to go out to pasture and let us run things.’ But ‘elder’ in this context has a whole different meaning. To me, it means being relevant.”Many of the attendees said they felt shocked that age had crept up on them. “I’ve always been the youngest, and I’m kind of surprised that I’m actually getting older,” said Ms. Wann, 38, a little later, as she walked through the contemplation garden. “Now people are coming to me for advice, and I’m seeing myself as someone whose lived experience is worth passing on.”Mr. Conley had established an open kitchen, and we were encouraged to eat any snacks we liked (almonds, prunes, dates) and also to do our own dishes.He also issued us Modern Elder flip-flops. The bottom of one read “GROW,” and the other “WHOLE.” People put them on and headed to the beach.Ms. Stevens observed that talking about aging was enlivening. “It’s not making me think about death at all,” she said. “It’s making me think about the life I have left.”ImageSaul Kuperstein, a shaman, performs a sunrise ceremony overlooking the Pacific Ocean.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesAfter beach meditation (“Our bodies are made of water and minerals and we are sitting here with water and minerals,” said the guide), the group wandered the shore collecting sticks. They dug them into sand at the high-tide line, making a stick wall. We watched them fall all week as the water rose up, picking off sticks a few at a time and dragging them out to sea.Mr. Conley said this was one of the most important symbols.‘For those frightened of yoga, this is not yoga’The next morning, there was another circle with more sharing. The main activity that day, Mr. Conley said, would be “a purge with the fire.”When the time came, Mr. Conley and his assistants filled a table with stickers that had ageist anxieties scrawled on them. The elders were told to pick any they felt applied to them and affix them to their chests.Ms. Stevens put on “Millennials rule the world” and “I wish I was a digital native.” Jeff Hamaoui, 47, who ran a supply-chain consultancy before joining Modern Elder as its director of education, wrote his own: “I am not practical or handy.”Others covered their chests and arms with stickers. “I fear being an old lady or man on the streets.” “I’m out of time to try something new.” “I feel increasingly invisible.”The group members wandered silently, looking at each other and reading the notes. One by one, they peeled the messages off and burned them in a fire pit on the veranda.ImageAs the week progressed, there was a growing sense of empowerment and camaraderie — almost rebellion. Mr. Conley talked about reclaiming the term elder like the gay community has reclaimed queer.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesLunch was lentil soup, beer and cheese.At 5:30, the schedule called for restorative yoga, and as a small panic spread it became clear this was not a cohort accustomed to retreat culture.“For those frightened of yoga,” Mr. Conley said, “this is not yoga, this is lying down.”The instructor, Teddi Dean, showed up. He had long, shaggy blond hair. “Recognize that you’re in a body, recognize the weight of a body,” he told the group as the sun set.Mr. Conley had packed the days with activities, circle after circle. To speak, the members passed a long and knotty talking stick with deep holes all the way though, like Swiss cheese. Soon, many in the group were seeing their boundaries fall. Some cried. Others said they were sharing things for the first time. One person disclosed terminal cancer that few at home knew about.Another circle started, this one about “liminality.” Mr. Hamaoui said, “I feel like I’m just not getting it. I watch YouTube stars and all these things, and intellectually I get it, but emotionally I just can’t connect.”Snaps of agreement came from around the circle. No one else connected with the YouTube stars either, and it was O.K. There was a growing sense of empowerment and camaraderie — almost rebellion. Mr. Conley talked about reclaiming the term elder like the gay community has reclaimed queer.“The social narrative is basically, midlife is a crisis and after a crisis you have decrepitude,” Mr. Conley said. “But you actually are much happier in your 60s and 70s, so why aren’t we preparing for that?”Later in the week, Caroline Czirr, 49, a brand manager in Colorado, got the talking stick. “This feels good,” said Ms. Czirr. “It feels good. I’m turning 50 next month, and I was just going to have dinner with friends.”Her voice rose. “But now I want cake,” she said. “I want champagne. And I want to see a D.J., and I want to make out with a guy at a bar.”Mr. Conley’s expansion plans include building a Modern Elder retirement community near El Pescadero. Mr. Hamaoui, who is leading that effort, said the new facility would accommodate both short and permanent stays. He and Mr. Conley are imagining it as an “intergenerational community,” he said one evening, leaning back on the Modern Elder veranda. He expects Millennials will want to join."
5c50cdcf3a125f5075c06f79,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/style/the-edit-fast-food-college.html,"Welcome to The Edit. Each week in our newsletter, you’ll hear from college students and recent graduates about issues going on in their lives. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.It was easy to laugh when President Trump served the Clemson University football team a fast-food buffet at the White House. The sight of McDonald’s fries, cheeseburgers and sauce packets piled high beneath Abraham Lincoln’s portrait led to days of jokes on late night shows, Twitter and beyond.“I would think that’s their favorite food,” Mr. Trump said.The spread was a strange choice for the setting, but the president wasn’t completely wrong about how college students eat. A 2015 study found that more than 70 percent of college students surveyed ate fast food at least once a day. Another survey found that 45 percent of adults ages 20 to 39 eat fast food or pizza on any given day.A number of factors could explain this high rate of fast food consumption by college kids. For some of us, it’s the first time we are free to decide what we’re going to eat. We also tend to stay up late, and fast food is available in large quantities at all hours of the day and night.But there’s another, more obvious explanation: College students eat fast food because it’s right in front of them, served on campus by their schools.I go to the University of Oklahoma, so let’s use that as an example. The school operates 30 places to eat on campus, including nine chain restaurants like Starbucks and Quiznos. To me, the chains seem to drum up more excitement than their independent counterparts.The vendor I visit most often is the Chick-fil-A in the student union, where I pick up breakfast two or three times a week. My routine continued when I commuted to an internship this summer and ate breakfast at a stand-alone Chick-fil-A instead.It’s clear to see how Chick-fil-A benefits from the habit I picked up at school. “Restaurants targeting college campuses makes a lot of sense because, basically, you have this bubble that most students live in, right?” said Sam Oches, who has written about campus dining for QSR, a food service trade magazine. “It’s a very captivated audience. They’re going to build a loyalty to your brand in college that they can carry on to the rest of their lives.”Mr. Oches added that schools often benefit financially from keeping students on campus, instead of letting them buy food elsewhere. He said schools “don’t really want the students to go to town. Spending their money on campus is a lot better for the university.”Following that logic, I assumed chains might also save universities money. Brands gain loyal customers by having locations on college campuses, so I thought they could be paying schools for this access.I thought wrong. After franchise fees and other costs, branded restaurants are 7 to 10 percent more expensive for my university to operate than generic ones, according to Dave Annis, the associate vice president and director of housing and food services at Oklahoma.He also said it’s worth it.“Ten, 15 years ago, food service wasn’t even in the top 10 reasons you would pick a university,” Mr. Annis said. “Current studies show food services are in the top three reasons a student picks a university. Having a competitive food service helps us recruit.”Grand Canyon University, a private Christian school in Phoenix, helps demonstrate the correlation between amenities like broad dining options and recruiting. Over the past several years, the school has increased its offering of brand-name restaurants on campus relative to non-franchise options. The school has also seen huge gains in enrollment in that span, from under 1,000 students on campus in 2009 to just over 20,000 in 2018.“There’s always that balance in school, trying to figure out where you’re going to eat,” said Gwen Massett, who graduated from Grand Canyon University in December with a degree in digital film. “It really comes down to making the time to cook or buy food. Realistically, though, a lot of students end up eating at Chick-fil-A, Subway or Taco Bell.”There are no franchises on campus at John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Ark. The school is much smaller than Oklahoma and Grand Canyon, with just under 2,000 students on campus. “The licensing costs and royalty fees, infrastructure costs and supply chain logistics can make it cost-prohibitive with limited enrollment,” Christine Blaha, the school’s food service director, wrote in an email.Students at John Brown want to see a franchise on campus anyway.“That’s an idea we’ve been lobbying for, and by ‘lobbying for,’ I mean complaining about,” said Owen Terexia, a freshman political science major at John Brown. “If there was something like a Chick-fil-A you could use your meal plan on, people wouldn’t hesitate to do that.”When Oklahoma students complained that they wanted healthier options and more variety in their dining options, Mr. Addis and his team gave the student body four new dining options to choose from. Ultimately, students voted for Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers, choosing taste over nutrition.Mr. Addis said Cane’s has been popular with students, “which leads us always to question, when the students ask for something: Do we give them what they say they want, or what they really want?”This, it seems, is the central issue: Schools aren’t choosing to install franchise restaurants on their own, but because students have asked for them.Like pulling all-nighters in the library or complaining about too little parking, the worst of my fast food habit will probably be a college pastime I’ll leave behind after I graduate in May. Until then, I’ll be happy to keep having Chick-fil-A for breakfast.What We’re ReadingElite Law Firm’s All-White Partner Class Stirs Debate on Diversity Paul, Weiss is more diverse at its top ranks than most of its peers.

At the beginning of my first semester, I joined a varsity team in a sport I had performed well at in high school and declared my major in a STEM field that I was curious enough about. With the first semester of college down, I can safely say that I excelled in both. I feel really bored in each place as well as my university at large, where despite being part of the honors college and getting to know a lot of people around me, I still find that I’m at the top of my classes and have trouble finding people who are as passionate about academics as I am. As I look to the next semester, I find that I want to quit my sport, change my major, and transfer — all in search of topics, activities, people and places that inspire and excite me in ways that my current surroundings lack.By exceeding where I am, I’ll prepare myself with skills that will benefit me later on: be it my sport’s work ethic and physical fitness, the critical thinking involved in my major, or a G.P.A. that might be higher than it could be at another school. Is it better to try to find places where I might be happier (and more excited) or to stay where it’s clear that I’ll be able to be ok? And should I try to modify my current situation in order to try to challenge myself more so that I at least stay engaged in what I’m doing vs. zoning out because things are too easy?Theo Balcomb, the managing producer of The Daily, weighed in on this one:I was right there with you midway through my first year. I can hear in your letter the care and time that you’ve put into this decision. I mean, my goodness, visiting colleges, getting into one, choosing your home for the next four years in the midst of saying goodbye to your childhood one is hard enough.Now you’re thinking about reversing all those decisions, and you’re looking over an abyss of more unknown. Acknowledging all that, let me say: You are doing the work that so many people don’t do.You are questioning whether you’re in the right place. Lots of people do that. You are worrying that your choices won’t lead you to where you want to be and won’t make you happy in the meantime. Lots of people do that. But you are thinking about a new way forward. You are putting yourself out there and jumping into something new. Lots of people don’t do that. I think they’re usually unhappier for it.I can’t say exactly what will happen if you choose to apply to transfer. I can’t say that you’ll get into another school that you’ll like. I can’t say that you will, and then you’ll go, and once you’re there you won’t think about all the things you missed by making that choice. I can say that I felt many of the absences you’re feeling. Being in a place I thought I wanted that wasn’t quite right, being afraid to accept that I made the wrong choice, being angry that I was surrounded by people who didn’t want to read books as much as I did.I think you can’t ignore those feelings too long. I ended up making my choice to apply to transfer because I needed to just try to see if there was another option. I had been burned by the college search once before. I hadn’t gotten into my dream school the first go around. I had settled and I thought it might be fine to settle for so many similar reasons that you cite: the honors program, the friends you’ve already made, your grades.I think you should consider putting those things aside for right now. Try looking at other options. Feel out how it might feel to be you a year from now on one of those campuses. Apply. If you think you need to have a sure bet of getting out, apply to a reach and a not-so-reach. Going through that will solidify, I think, your feelings on where you are. You might hunker down on the things you do like about your current situation. Or you might start living a bunch of new fantasy lives in your head that you’d rather live out. That’s how you’ll know if you need to jump or not.I hope no matter what happens, you find a group of people as passionate about academics as you are. Knowing how much thought you’re putting into this decision, I know you can find that where you are or wherever you might go.P. S. Just saying, transferring to Barnard College, which is famous for accepting a high number of transfer students, turned out to be the best decision I ever made.Navigating college and the years afterward can be tough, but we’re here to help!

5c6e8ce43a125f5075c0ac59,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/dealbook/china-us-trade-talks.html,"Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade talks progress, with fears of overcompromiseAmerican and Chinese officials have reportedly begun to hash out documents that could form the basis of a trade deal, but there are growing concerns that leaders of both nations are softening on key demands. More on the progress from Bloomberg, citing an unidentified source:• Several memorandums of understanding “would cover areas including agriculture, non-tariff barriers, services, technology transfer and intellectual property, said the person.”• “The enforcement mechanism remains unclear, but would likely be a threat that tariffs would be reimposed if conditions aren’t met, the person said.”• “No breakthrough is expected during this week’s talks,” though an extension to a March 1 deadline is still a possibility.But there’s a new fear surrounding the deal. According to Lingling Wei and Bob Davis of the WSJ, there are “growing concerns on the home front” in both America and China that their leaders — and President Trump in particular — are “going to cave in to the other side”:• Some officials reportedly believe Mr. Trump is “tiring of the trade dispute and is poised to cut a deal that won’t lead to fundamental changes by China.”• “American Enterprise Institute China scholar Derek Scissors said that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a China hawk, holds significant leverage over Mr. Trump to keep to a hard line — including, potentially, the threat of resigning if the deal falls short.”More trade news: Mr. Trump reportedly continues to consider E.U. car tariffs — levies that Volkswagen says could cost it billions of euros per year. And is the clothes maker American Giant, which makes all its products in the U.S., a model for Mr. Trump’s ambitions?Wall Street sees profits in helping Main StreetHedge funds and investment banks think they’ve found a big new moneymaker, according to Matt Goldstein and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: so-called opportunity funds, part of President Trump’s tax package to steer money to poor areas by offering large tax breaks.• “More than 80 of the funds have sprung up since January 2018, even though the Trump administration has not finalized regulations governing them.”• The pitch to potential investors: outsize returns while fighting poverty.• The provision that created opportunity funds “lowers capital gains taxes — potentially dramatically — for investors who finance projects in about 8,700 so-called opportunity zones spread across the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.”• The financial benefit? “An investor who keeps money in such a fund for 10 years is able to exclude 15 percent of the original capital gain from taxation. And — potentially much more lucratively — the investor would not owe taxes on any gains that accrued if the investment increased in value in that time.”• “Skeptics worry that the funds will mostly target real estate and other projects that probably would have attracted investment even without the tax break, and may not deliver the returns being dangled.”ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission’s president.CreditYves Herman/ReutersTheresa May could be making progress on BrexitThe British prime minister was in Brussels yesterday to press for changes that could save her Brexit deal. She may finally be making some headway, though she still needs to convince lawmakers of any changes to her plan.She made her case to the E.U. In discussions with the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, she pressed for “legally binding changes” to her existing deal that she hopes will make it palatable to British lawmakers. Britain’s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, are expected to propose wordings for those legal tweaks today.Some progress may have been made. “A Brexit agreement is already being hammered out in Brussels, according to Spain’s foreign minister, as the bloc seeks reassuring language that can convince British members of Parliament to back the deal,” Bloomberg explains.But the E.U. may demand that any changes are first approved in Britain. The E.U. “doesn’t want to call leaders for a summit to sign off on changes that are then rejected by the U.K. Parliament,” Bloomberg reports, adding that “once there’s an agreement, it should be tested in Parliament, and only after that will leaders be asked to sign off on it at a summit.” And it is far from clear that lawmakers would approve.More Brexit news: Nine more Conservative party lawmakers have reportedly said that they could resign from the party in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The credit agency Fitch may downgrade Britain’s double-A rating over concerns about Brexit. Europe isn’t convinced by Trump’s war on HuaweiThe White House has spent the last year trying to convince Europe that the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is a national security threat and shouldn’t be given any role in developing new wireless networks. So far, that plan doesn’t appear to be working.British officials don’t seem to agree with the White House. “Ciaran Martin, who leads Britain’s National Cyber Security Center, expressed confidence at a conference in Brussels that any security risks Huawei posed could be managed,” Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.Nor do those in Germany. The news follows a WSJ report yesterday that said “the German government is leaning toward letting Huawei Technologies Co. participate in building the nation’s high-speed internet infrastructure.”“If Britain does not ban Huawei, it would be a defeat for the White House,” Mr. Satariano writes. “Because Britain belongs to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States, whatever it decides on Huawei is likely to affect how other countries treat the company.”Deutsche Bank lost $1.6 billion on a Buffett-related betThe German lender suffered one of its biggest-ever trading losses from a decade-long wager on a municipal-bond investment that spiraled out of control, the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources.• The bank bought $7.8 billion worth of municipal bonds in 2007, later covered with insurance purchased from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.• The WSJ says Deutsche Bank “resisted for years reducing the value of those bonds and related derivatives on its books to a level that markets suggested they were worth,” and dismissed concerns from auditors.• “Internally, the bank acknowledged losses on the trade only incrementally. After it finally liquidated the position nine years after buying the bonds, bank executives debated whether to restate past financial results, but never did so.”• Deutsche Bank finally liquidated the position in the summer of 2016, after its C.E.O. at the time, John Cryan, demanded the trade be wound down.• “The prolonged struggle over how to handle the investment sheds light on cultural and financial challenges inside one of Europe’s biggest banks that have hampered its ability to compete with stronger U.S. rivals.”More Deutsche Bank news: Executives were reportedly so worried about the Trump Organization defaulting on $340 million in loans during the Trump presidency that they discussed extending repayment dates until 2025.France fines UBS $4.2 billion in tax evasion caseThe Swiss bank was hit by one of France’s biggest-ever financial penalties yesterday for helping wealthy French clients hide money from the authorities.The judgment was seven years in the making. French authorities began investigating after whistle-blowers tipped them off. According to the NYT, prosecutors said that UBS bankers in France eager for big bonuses “had alerted their counterparts in Switzerland to potential ‘big potatoes’ ” — French citizens with assets of at least €500,000, or about $560,000.Bankers used “James Bond” methods to hide their work. They “followed a UBS ‘security governance manual’ that included instructions for using encrypted computers, using business cards without the bank’s logo and switching hotels frequently,” according to the NYT.UBS will appeal. The firm said that the case was “based on the unfounded allegations of former employees,” and its C.E.O. derided the verdict as “superficial” and “astounding.”Pedophile comments spur a YouTube ad boycottMajor companies including Nestlé and Epic Games said yesterday that they had stopped buying ads on Google’s video platform. The reason, the NYT reports: Pedophiles were swarming the comment sections of children’s videos.The companies acted after a user posted a video that pointed out that innocent videos of youngsters were being overrun with suggestive comments aimed at the children.The video’s creator, Matt Watson, accused YouTube of “facilitating the sexual exploitation” of children. He added that the site’s recommendation system guided predators to other videos featuring minors.A Google spokeswoman said the company had taken action by deleting accounts and offensive comments. “Any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube,” she said.ImageElizabeth Holmes of TheranosCreditJeff Chiu/Associated PressInside the final throes of TheranosAt this point, the blood-testing company is over. But Nick Bilton of Vanity Fair writes that in its final months, Theranos’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, tried to abandon a high-spending lifestyle and attempted to convince employees that everything was O.K.:• “Holmes had a hard time weaning herself off certain luxuries. She still had her own personal security detail, drivers, personal assistants and a personal publicist who was on retainer for $25,000 a month.”• “By late 2017, however, Holmes had begun to slightly rein in the spending.” She agreed to give up her private-jet travel, and moved the company’s premises from Palo Alto to Newark, to premises that former employees called “crummy.”• “Yet through all of this, former employees of the company have told me, Holmes had a bizarre way of acting like nothing was wrong. Even more peculiarly, she appeared happy. ‘The company is falling apart, there are countless indictments piling up, employees are leaving in droves, and Elizabeth is just weirdly chipper,’ a former senior executive told me.”America’s professional elite: rich and miserable?Those in the upper echelon are hoarding money and privilege to a degree not seen in decades. But that doesn’t make them happy at work, Charles Duhigg writes in the NYT:• “A surprising portion of Americans are professionally miserable right now. In the mid-1980s, roughly 61 percent of workers told pollsters they were satisfied with their jobs. Since then, that number has declined substantially, hovering around half, according to data collected by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization.”• “Even among professionals given to lofty self-images, like those in medicine and law, other studies have noted a rise in discontent.”• “Why? Based on my own conversations with classmates and the research I began reviewing, the answer comes down to oppressive hours, political infighting, increased competition sparked by globalization, an ‘always-on culture’ bred by the internet — but also something that’s hard for these professionals to put their finger on, an underlying sense that their work isn’t worth the grueling effort they’re putting into it.”Revolving doorDane Butswinkas is stepping down as Tesla’s general counsel, only two months after joining the carmaker from the law firm Williams & Connolly.Keith Rabois, the veteran investor, is leaving Khosla Ventures for Founders Fund, the venture capital firm run by his longtime friend Peter Thiel.Robin Phillips, a co-head of HSBC’s global banking division, will reportedly step down this summer.Serena Williams joined the board of Poshmark, an online retailer.The speed readDeals• Lyft plans to begin its I.P.O. roadshow on March 18, paving the way to begin trading publicly on the Nasdaq stock market by early April.

5c50807f3a125f5075c06e89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/disable-facetime-bug.html,"A major bug in Apple’s FaceTime app surfaced on Monday that allows anyone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer to eavesdrop on other users without their knowledge. Apple said Monday evening that it was aware of the glitch, was working on a fix and would release it in a software update later this week.In the meantime, Apple has turned off Group FaceTime, the feature that allowed for surreptitious listening, which should temporarily resolve the issue. But for those who want an extra layer of security, follow these steps to turn off FaceTime on your devices.Step 1: Check if you’re susceptibleBefore you do anything, you need to make sure your Apple device was affected by the glitch. It exists on iOS devices with the most recent software updates, starting with iOS 12.1, which was released in October. That release introduced the Group FaceTime feature.To check your iOS version, open the “Settings” app, scroll down and select “General,” and then click on “About.” In the following list, you’ll see a line titled “Version” followed by the operating system on your device. It may say 12.1.3, the latest iOS update.VideoThe glitch appears on iPhones running iOS 12.1 or newer. Here’s how to check your iOS version.CreditCreditOdd Andersen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIf your iOS is 12.1 or newer, such as 12.1.3, your device could be at risk. If it is 12.0 or older, you’re in the clear.On Macs, the Group FaceTime feature was introduced in October, starting with MacOS 10.14.1. Check your MacOS version by selecting the Apple icon in the top left of your screen and clicking on “About This Mac.” The latest version is MacOS 10.14.3.ImageApple disabled Group FaceTime, the feature that caused the glitch, while it works on a permanent fix.Step 2: Turn off FaceTimeOn an iOS device, open “Settings” again. Scroll down a bit until you see “FaceTime” and select it. This part is simple: Tap the green button on the top row, which will toggle FaceTime off. The button should turn gray and everything that had been below, such as your app settings, should disappear.Apple says there’s no need to delete the app on your home screen after following this step, but nothing’s stopping you.VideoDisabling the FaceTime app on an iPhone takes only a few steps.CreditCreditJohn G Mabanglo/EPA, via ShutterstockJust note that if you disable FaceTime, your phone will not receive any kind of FaceTime call, including video, audio or group chat. Regular phone calls won’t be affected.To turn off FaceTime on Macs, open the app, which may be in your dock or in your Applications folder, select “FaceTime” at the top left of the app, and then select “Preferences.” Click on “Sign Out.”Step 3: Wait for bug fixApple said that a software update scheduled for release later this week should resolve the Group FaceTime bug. When it is announced, make sure to update your devices by going to “Settings,” then “General” and selecting “Software Update.” On the Mac, download the update by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left of your screen, selecting “System Preferences” and clicking on “Software Update.”After that, re-enable the FaceTime app by following Step 2. On iOS devices, toggle the FaceTime button in “Settings” until it turns green again. It may take a bit of time for your old settings and account information to reappear. On a Mac, open the app again and sign back in under “Preferences.”And if you deleted the app on your iPhone or iPad, you can re-download it through the App Store."
5c5175b23a125f5075c070f3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/personaltech/save-next-apple-purchase.html,"Gadgets like Apple’s iPhone have become so powerful and durable that you can wait many years before buying a new one. The bad news is that your next upgrade will probably cost a lot more.Consider that last year, Apple raised prices for most of its products. They included its iPhones, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, MacBook Air and iPad Pro. (Yes, that is nearly the company’s entire gadget lineup.) Apple has said the increases were necessary because the products had become more complex and expensive to make.Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, defended the iPhone’s rising prices in an interview with “Good Morning America” in September. He said the iPhone was an all-in-one gadget replacing cameras and music players, among other gizmos. “We found that people want to have the most innovative product available, and with that, it’s not cheap to do that,” he said.That justification did not add up for me. Since the iPhone’s debut in 2007, it had been a multifunctional device that continually incorporated cutting-edge features without significant price increases. The same went for Apple’s watches, computers and tablets: They became more advanced over the years without big price jumps — until now.And there is a question of whether Apple has pushed prices up too high. On Tuesday, the company — while dealing with reports about an embarrassing privacy glitch that let iPhone users eavesdrop on one another’s microphones — reported disappointing financial results. In a letter warning investors before the quarterly earnings report, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales may have slowed because of factors including higher prices.For a reality check on Apple’s pricing, I spoke to financial experts and pricing strategists. I learned that there is credence to Apple’s arguments: Its products do cost more to produce than in years past. But that didn’t stop me from consulting with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products and tracks deals, for advice on how we could shave the costs of our next Apple upgrades.Here’s what I found.How and why Apple raised pricesLast year, Apple’s prices shot up by 7 percent to 60 percent, depending on the product. Perhaps the most notable increase was for the new Mac Mini, which costs about $800, up from $500. (The last Mac Mini debuted in 2014.) Some Apple prices stayed firm or declined. Notably, the newer entry-level iPad is selling for about $330, down from $500 in years past.But in general, prices jumped. That was surprising given that product costs typically fall as technologies mature and parts become widely available, which was what happened with televisions.The more I examined the pricing, though, the more evidence there was that the latest Apple products are more expensive to make. Apple also appears to be under pressure to introduce more complex innovations to compete in the brutal technology market.Take a look at the company’s gross profit margin, or the money it makes from products after the cost to make and sell them is factored in. If Apple’s gross margins are lower today even though prices are higher, that indicates the products cost more to make. And that is indeed the case. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who has studied Apple for years, estimated that the company’s gross margins for the iPhone were below 40 percent, down from more than 50 percent several years ago. Mr. Sacconaghi said the shrinking margins demonstrated how tough it had become to compete in the technology market. Apple has had to add features like stronger metals, sophisticated cameras, high-resolution displays, advanced chips and faster wireless connectivity while trimming back on some profit given that rival products from the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo have become very capable. If Apple had wanted to keep profit margins consistent with past years, he said, it would have had to raise prices even higher and risk losing sales.“You have to put in more to stay competitive, or you’re going to lose share,” he said.Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said Apple was still in a unique position to introduce broad price increases. Other companies, such as grocery brands, lack the clout to do so because their competitors might undercut them and lure away customers.“They’re in the very enviable position that they can, by and large, take major action across the board without, so far, seeing a major erosion of loyalty as a result,” Mr. Wiesel said.An Apple spokeswoman referred to Mr. Cook’s comments on Tuesday’s earnings call. In response to a question about whether Apple had raised prices too high, Mr. Cook said the prices were not that much more. He noted that the iPhone XS was the same price as last year's iPhone X, and that the XR was priced only slightly higher than the iPhone 8.How to save on Apple gearDiscounts for new Apple products are rare. But here are several methods to lower the cost of your next purchase.Trade in your old deviceOne simple way to get some cash toward your next purchase is to take your old devices to a trade-in program at a retailer or a wireless store. Apple runs Apple GiveBack, which gives you Apple Store credit in exchange for an old phone, tablet, computer or smart watch. Gazelle, an online reseller, will let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs in exchange for cash or Amazon store credit. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless offer trade-in programs. And Best Buy stores also provide store credit for many used devices. Buy last year’s modelThe best part about the release of a new Apple product is that last year’s model can be had for cheaper. Apple now sells the iPhone 8, still a very good phone, for about $600, down from its original $700 price. Wait for salesOlder-generation Apple Watches and tablets occasionally go on sale during holiday shopping periods such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Wirecutter said. In November, the Apple Watch Series 3 dropped to $200 on Amazon, down from the original $330.To scout for deals, you can create alerts for price drops using web tools like Camel Camel Camel. Wirecutter also runs a webpage that regularly highlights deals.Apple product discounts tend to be better when you buy through third parties like Best Buy and Amazon. “The best tip is to shop around before going to the Apple Store,” said Alex Roth, a commerce editor for Wirecutter.Buy used or refurbished gadgetsTrusted brands like Apple, Best Buy and Amazon offer programs to buy refurbished or used products. Refurbished products typically were returned by a consumer and then restored to excellent condition, and they often include a fresh battery and warranty. Apple’s online store for refurbished products lists last year’s iPad Pro for about $550, down from about $650.Buying used Apple gadgets can often yield more savings, but you will have to be judicious about whom you buy from. Your best bet is to buy from a friend, a relative or a reseller that is a trusted brand. I have had consistently good experiences buying used products from Amazon’s Warehouse program, for example.Skip the upgrade altogetherOf course, you can save $750 on the next $750 iPhone by not buying it at all. The most thrifty thing you can do is to maintain your device and skip upgrading. Plenty of Apple customers have caught on to this approach. The company acknowledged in its recent note to investors that many iPhone customers took advantage of its battery replacement program, which may have contributed to slower sales of replacements.There’s a hidden benefit to giving your devices some tender loving care.“Take good care of the one you have so that when the time comes for an upgrade, you can trade that one in and you’ll get something for it,” Mr. Roth said."
5c545c283a125f5075c078ea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/technology/facetime-bug-fixed.html,"Apple said Friday that it had fixed a security flaw in iPhones that allowed people to call another iPhone via FaceTime and listen in on conversations even if the recipient didn’t answer, resolving an alarming vulnerability that undermined the company’s public commitment to security. A software update will be released next week, the company said.The new update will allow owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to re-enable Group FaceTime, the feature that had allowed the potential eavesdropping, Apple said. (Instructions on how to update a device’s software are below.)Apple’s response came four days after the flaw was widely reported, and nearly two weeks since a concerned customer alerted the company. This week, before fixing the bug, the company raced to disable Group FaceTime, which allows people to video chat with several people.A 14-year-old Arizona boy discovered that he could listen to a friend via Group FaceTime on Jan. 19, even if the friend didn’t answer the call. His mother repeatedly tried to flag the issue to Apple, but the company was slow to respond.“We want to assure our customers that as soon as our engineering team became aware of the details necessary to reproduce the bug, they quickly disabled Group FaceTime and began work on the fix,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement Friday. “We are committed to improving the process by which we receive and escalate these reports, in order to get them to the right people as fast as possible.”The incident was embarrassing for a company that regularly boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple publicly acknowledged the bug — branded “FacePalm” by security researchers — on Monday, Timothy D. Cook, the company’s chief executive, tweeted that “we all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.”After the vulnerability became public, security researchers and politicians raised concerns about the security of Apple’s products. To pre-empt security attacks, in 2016 Apple started offering hackers a $200,000 bounty if they flagged bugs to the company. But some hackers have said the program has had a slow start because they can make more money selling the flaws on the black market.To install the update when it is released, follow these steps for iPhones, iPads and Macs:■ On an iPhone or an iPad, open the Settings app, then tap General and then tap Software Update. From here, download the newest iOS version, which is expected to be called 12.1.4. When the update is ready, choose Install Now. As a precaution, make sure your iPhone or iPad is plugged into a power source when installing the update.■ On a Mac, open the App Store app. Then click the Updates tab, and click Update next to MacOS Mojave. (If you are using an older version of the Mac operating system, you will not see this option and do not need to download the update.) When the download is finished, make sure your power cable is plugged in and restart the computer."
5c7d5ce049f0eacbf105b438,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/design/david-hockney-van-gogh-amsterdam-the-joy-of-nature.html,"AMSTERDAM — It’s easy to miss the Vincent van Gogh paintings at “Hockney/Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature.”In the Van Gogh Museum’s blockbuster spring exhibition, which runs through May 26, Mr. Hockney’s dazzlingly vibrant multi-canvas paintings — like “The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire in 2011” — are hung like murals across the gallery walls. Van Gogh’s much smaller landscapes appear here and there on pillars, somewhat like punctuation marks to Hockney’s effusive sentences.And if you imagine that the link between the contemporary British painter and the 19th-century Post-Impressionist is the use of bold, contrasting colors — purples and blues set against mustard yellows — you will quickly think again. The brilliant palette of Mr. Hockney’s 2008 “More Felled Trees on Woldgate” looks psychedelic next to van Gogh’s subdued cobalts and azures in “The Garden of St. Paul’s Hospital (‘Leaf Fall’)” from 1889. Van Gogh was one of early modernism’s most radical colorists, but Mr. Hockney has taken the ball and run with it, far, far down the field.ImageThe palette of Mr. Hockney’s “More Felled Trees on Woldgate” from 2008 makes the colors of van Gogh’s works appear subdued.Creditvia Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam;Richard SchmidtScale and color may not be the things that tie these two major art figures together, but it is clear from “Hockney/Van Gogh” that Mr. Hockney’s admiration for van Gogh is far from incidental. There are drawings in the exhibitionthat could have been ripped from van Gogh’s sketchbook.“Midsummer, East Yorkshire” — Mr. Hockney’s 2004 series of 36 watercolors on paper — is a direct homage to van Gogh’s Provence landscapes, with their wheat fields, wheel-like haystacks, stocky clouds and high horizon lines. Squint a little and one can easily mistake Mr. Hockney’s 2005 oil painting “Woldgate Vista” with its layer-cake structure of wild grass, farmland, hills and sky, for van Gogh’s “The Harvest” of 1888.Mr. Hockney said he believes that the main link between him and van Gogh is not color, brushwork or subject matter — though both men clearly have a fascination with nature: “It’s clarity of space, I think,” he said in an interview. “Van Gogh could see space very, very clearly.”ImageMr. Hockney in Amsterdam last month. At 81, he continues to work from early morning until evening.CreditRobin Utrecht/EPA, via ShutterstockIn the exhibition catalog, he elaborated: “Somebody once said that my work has a graphic clarity, and I suppose it does. But if that’s true, van Gogh’s work has a double graphic clarity.”“Hockney/Van Gogh” is neither a side-by-side comparison nor a Hockney retrospective — he had three of those in 2017, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Tate Modern in London and Centre Pompidou in Paris. Instead, it is a selection of about 60 works by Mr. Hockney, and eight paintings and three drawings by van Gogh. The bulk of the Hockney works are landscapes created from about 2004 to 2011, created in the Woldgate Woods in northern England.Edwin Becker, chief curator of exhibitions at the Van Gogh Museum, said that van Gogh’s influence on Mr. Hockney started after the artist visited a van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, England, in 1955. “It lingers on and on and on,” Mr. Becker said. “Sometimes it’s more direct, and sometimes it’s more subconscious.”Image“Woldgate Woods, 26, 27 & 30 July 2006.” Mr. Hockney captured the landscapes of northern England across the seasons in different media.Creditvia Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam;Richard SchmidtAbout half of the exhibition is devoted to depictions of Woldgate Woods — particularly of a path through tall, slender trees captured across the seasons in different media. Some are oil paintings made “en plein-air” — outdoors, as many 19th-century painters did, including van Gogh — over three or four days. Others are digital video compositions and drawings made with an iPad.For the video installation “The Four Seasons, Woldgate Woods” from 2010 to 2011, Mr. Hockney mounted nine cameras on a moving Jeep to simultaneously film the path in the woods from multiple perspectives. Here, they are presented as clusters of nine monitors on four walls, each presenting the same view in different season: winter, spring, summer or fall.With each camera pointed in a slightly different direction, the viewer is forced to look at the scene as a composite of multiple perspectives. “I know it makes it more interesting because you have to look at each one, and to do that, you have to make space in your mind,” Mr. Hockney said.ImageSome of Mr. Hockney’s works echo “The Harvest” by van Gogh, a painting from 1888.CreditVincent van Gogh Foundation/Van Gogh Museum, AmsterdamIn the spring of 2011, Mr. Hockney revisited the woods with his iPad, creating the series “The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire” in the electric greens, pastel blues and hot pinks of the device’s palette.Mr. Hockney, now 81, has actively embraced digital technology, especially in his recent work, and is one of the few artists of his generation to have done so. Mr. Becker, the curator, said he saw this as another important similarity between the two artists.“Van Gogh was constantly on the search for new ways of working, from naturalism, to Impressionism to Post-Impressionism, to add to his own style,” Mr. Becker said. “The same goes for Hockney, because he embraces new techniques, new developments — be it the Polaroid, the Pentax camera, the video camera, the iPad.”Image“The Garden of St. Paul’s Hospital (‘Leaf Fall’)” by van Gogh, who one of early modernism’s most radical colorists.CreditVincent van Gogh Foundation/Van Gogh Museum, AmsterdamMr. Hockney said there was a pragmatic reason why, late in life, he learned to work with new technologies. At first, he said, “I realized that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed.”“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window,” he said at a news conference on Wednesday. “And I didn’t have to get up to get paint or water or a brush or pencils.” He made 70 or 80 pictures this way, “always in this same window, but every day it was different: different colors, no two sunrises are the same.”This approach (minus the iPad) resonates with van Gogh’s practice of exploring the same view or subject from multiple perspectives, in changing light, in different seasons.Mr. Hockney, who continues to work from early morning until evening (with the help of a midday nap, according to Mr. Becker), said that van Gogh put all of his energy and love into his work.“He put some beans on his fire when he went out in the morning, and he painted all day — eight hours, nine hours — then he’d come home and eat the beans,” Mr. Hockney said of van Gogh. “Then he’d converse with his brother for two hours by writing letters. The only time left for him was to sleep.”This, he said, is perhaps why van Gogh’s work has such enduring popular appeal — as does Mr. Hockney’s.“People have always been very attracted to van Gogh’s paintings: Since they were first shown in 1906, people have flocked to them,” he said. “He’s a great artist, still. It’s contemporary; if it’s speaking to you now, it’s contemporary.”"

They just appear all the time when we are not using the computer.No paper version of these photos would let us continually see our children and grandchildren throughout their years.Times change, and so will our ability to enjoy memories.Frayda LevinMountain Lakes, N.J.To the Editor:Peter Funt hits one of the unintended consequences of electronic communication. As a historian, I lamented this loss of printed records when email began, and routinely printed and saved representative emails my children sent. I also saved other printed memorabilia. I have reread these emails every year or two with as much joy as I have had rereading letters I sent my parents while I was traveling abroad in the 1970s. (My mom saved her children’s memorabilia as well as her own — every bank check back to 1943, when she married.)If I have grandchildren, I suspect that they will be interested in glimpsing their parents’ lives.

5caeec4749f0eacbf1f829aa,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/11/business/11reuters-apple-energy.html,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Thursday it has nearly doubled the number of suppliers using only clean energy for production work, including two that assemble and make the processor chips for the iPhone.Apple last year said it meets all of its needs with renewable energy such as solar farms that power data centers. But a large part of its carbon footprint comes from its supply chain, and since 2015 Apple has worked directly with those companies to use clean energy for Apple production.Forty-four companies are now in the program, Apple said on Thursday, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose Foxconn unit makes iPhones, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which supplies the A-series chips that power all of Apple's mobile devices. Apple had previously disclosed 23 suppliers in the program. The company defines clean energy as coming from wind, solar or bio-gas fuel cells, as well as what it calls ""low-impact"" hydroelectric projects like a site in Oregon that captures energy from water in irrigation canals to power one of its data centers. Apple did not specify where the new suppliers in the program would get the clean energy. It encourages suppliers to build their own renewable energy projects, such as when iPad assembler Compal last year built rooftop solar installations on its factories in China. When those options are not available, Apple says it aims to have suppliers sign power-purchase agreements with new renewable energy projects and using purchases of renewable energy credits only when there are no other options.In an interview, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said the company is also on track to pass its goal of adding 4 gigawatts of renewable energy to the grids of its supply chain by 2020 and has a ""sight line"" to ""well over"" 5 gigawatts.Jackson declined to say whether Apple would drop suppliers such as Foxconn and TSMC - whose capabilities few others in the global electronics supply chain can match - if they fail to meet their commitments to the program.""It took a while for them to come on board, and so we believe that now that they have, they're fully committed to doing it,"" Jackson said. ""And obviously if they fall down on the job, we'll be right there on their chase. I can't tell you what will happen, but I hope it never does.""

Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University two years ago. Her grades were poor and she felt insecure, doubtful that she belonged at such a prestigious institution. In sorting out her situation, she met with the school’s dean, Lorraine Branham, a longtime journalist and, like her, a black woman.Ms. Branham helped her gain a sense of self-worth and also helped carve a path for her that kept her in the program, Ms. Davis said. Now, at 22, she has already started her own company, CLLCTVE, which helps creative college students find careers, and is about to graduate.“She advocated for me in ways that made me feel seen, heard and valued,” Ms. Davis said in an email.Ms. Davis is but one of hundreds of students who turned to Ms. Branham at crucial points in their lives, and to whom Ms. Branham gave direction and encouragement. When Ms. Branham died on April 2 at 66, Ms. Davis said, she understood the meaning of the word “legacy” for the first time.Most educators dream of making a difference in the lives of their students. As the first woman and first person of color to lead the Newhouse School, Ms. Branham took particular interest in serving as a mentor. She also focused on diversifying the faculty and helping the school keep pace in a fast-changing media world.She became dean at a turbulent time for the news media, as the old business models for newspapers were breaking down and broadcast and cable television were being upended by streaming services.“Despite declining student interest in journalism as a career path, she nurtured the newspaper, magazine, broadcast news and photojournalism programs so that they were not lost in a sea of entertainment, advertising and public relations,” David Rubin, her predecessor as dean, wrote last week in a tribute to her in The Post-Standard of Syracuse. She was, he said, “the right dean at the right time.”ImageMs. Branham in 2014 at the dedication ceremony for the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center. She had spearheaded the creation of the facility, at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.CreditSyracuse UniversityHub Brown, the school’s associate dean of research, creativity, international initiatives and diversity, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Branham was “all about getting us to embrace the future.”“When Apple came out with iPads, she got the faculty iPads and said, ‘Work with this and figure out what we can do with it,’ ” Mr. Brown said. “She saw digital disruption everywhere, and she made sure our facilities were state of the art.”She was also determined to make the school more diverse. Amy Falkner, now the acting dean, said that during Ms. Branham’s tenure the percentage of faculty members of color increased to 25 percent from 17 percent, and the percentage of women on the faculty increased to 45 percent from 35 percent. A quarter of the student body is now people of color, and two-thirds of the students are women.Lorraine Elizabeth Green was born on Dec. 7, 1952, in Philadelphia, to Jesse Williams, a tavern owner, and Leona Green. Her parents split up when she was young, and she was raised by her mother and her stepfather, Henry Walls, a mechanic. She was the oldest of nine children on her mother’s side and the oldest of four on her father’s.She was married twice, first to Norris Branham, with whom she had a son, and then to Melvin Williams, whom she met at the Atlanta airport in 1991 when she sat down right next to him at a bank of otherwise unused pay phones. She did not change her surname when she married Mr. Williams.Ms. Branham, who lived outside Syracuse, died of uterine cancer at a hospital in Rochester, her sister Annette Walls-McLaurin said.In addition to her sister, she is survived by her husband; her son, Norris; and a granddaughter. She is survived on her mother’s side by her sisters Connie Walls-Presley, Henretta Ladson, Carol Ann Walls and Leona Walls, and her brothers Henry Jr., Averell and Vincent Walls. On her father’s side, she is survived by her sisters Elaine and Gisell Williams and her brother Kenneth Williams.An early influence on her was Ed Bradley, the longtime “60 Minutes” correspondent, who started out as a public-school teacher in Philadelphia and was her sixth-grade teacher. They stayed in touch, and, seeing that she was a good writer and curious about current affairs, he encouraged her to pursue a career in journalism.ImageMs. Branham with Oprah Winfrey at a reception for donors to the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center. Ms. Branham led an $18 million fund-raising campaign.CreditSyracuse UniversityAfter she graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia she remained in the city to attend Temple University, where she majored in radio, television and film, graduating in 1976. She was a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford in 1985-86.Ms. Branham began her reporting career with The Philadelphia Tribune in 1976, then moved to other reporting and editing jobs at The Courier-Post in Camden, N.J., The Philadelphia Bulletin and The Baltimore Sun before joining The Philadelphia Inquirer as an editor in 1987. She rose through the newspaper’s management ranks, including stints as New Jersey editor and associate managing editor for features.As New Jersey editor, Ms. Branham often represented The Inquirer at business and civic functions and lamented that she usually stood out as the only person of color — “like flies in buttermilk,” she used to say, according to Daniel R. Biddle, who was her deputy in New Jersey.“She said it with a weariness and thick skin and humor,” Mr. Biddle, who is white, said in an email. “She used the same tone when politicians or other people would walk into the New Jersey bureau and see her and see me, and say to her, ‘Can I talk to your boss?’ And Lorraine would say in that same voice, ‘I am the boss.’ ”She left The Inquirer in 1996 to become executive editor of The Tallahassee Democrat in Florida; she was the first woman and first African-American in that position. She then moved to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where she was assistant to the publisher from 2000 to 2002.That was her last newspaper job before she turned to academia. She was director of the school of journalism at the University of Texas at Austin from 2002 to 2008, when she became dean at the Newhouse School. She was chosen from a field of 300 applicants.At Syracuse, Ms. Branham led an $18 million fund-raising campaign and created the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center, which includes the Dick Clark Studios and the Alan Gerry Center for Media Innovation. During her tenure, the school established the Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship, the Peter A. Horvitz Endowed Chair in Journalism Innovation and the Newhouse Sports Media Center. She also helped establish satellite campus programs in New York and Los Angeles.In a statement, Donald Newhouse, son of the school’s founder, said that Ms. Branham had taken “a great school and with a monumental effort remolded it to keep it relevant to a world that is constantly in flux.”"
5c667fee3a125f5075c09dd8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/movies/52-places-traveler-movies.html,"I can’t remember what country I was flying over, or even what month it was, just that the “Mamma Mia!” sequel, “Here We Go Again,” was playing on the back of the airplane seat in front of me and I was sobbing like I had never sobbed before.One survey shows that even 41 percent of men will tear up at 10,000 feet. It has to do with the air pressure, dehydration, the stress of being herded like cattle, and the bloody marys we down to get through it all. I’d certainly done my fair share of crying on planes, as The New York Times’s first 52 Places Traveler, charged with the incredible and often body-punishing task of reporting on all those destinations while traveling solo around the world for a year.This was a different kind of cry, though. It was a movie cry, induced by that magical alchemy of Abba songs and a plotline that reminded me of my own quite alive, free-spirited mother whom I hadn’t seen in months and missed very much. Pop culture tends to reflect us back onto ourselves, and crammed into my tiny economy-class corner of that plane, watching two generations of actresses sing about finding inner strength while abroad, it may have been the first time I felt truly homesick. I missed my friends and my family, sure, but I also missed this, the cleansing power of getting swept up in the emotion of something I was watching or hearing — much to the discomfort of my seatmates.Before 52 Places, I had spent more than a decade as a culture writer for New York magazine. Of all the things I was leaving to embark on this experience of a lifetime — my loved ones, my job, my apartment — pop culture felt like the one link to home I could carry around in my pocket and rely on to keep me company when everyone I knew was asleep in a different time zone. Then as the trip went on, I got busy, the relationship grew distant. This essential pillar of my life began to crumble.MOVIES ARE MY COMFORT FOOD, and have been since I was 8 and my parents gave me my first memorable Christmas gift: a VHS tape of “Singin’ in the Rain,” which I watched on repeat for the next five years. As an isolated teenager in New Mexico, all I had to do was drive half an hour to the abundance of movie theaters around Santa Fe to visit other countries and lives. And as an adult, pop culture wasn’t something I consumed casually. I breathed it, partly because my job required it and partly because I loved being in the know. TV shows I’d missed the night before, I’d stream on Hulu over breakfast. Podcasts got me through my morning subway commute. Daytimes, I’d be reporting on something I’d seen. Evening brought more movie-viewing and conversations with friends about the entertainment-industry tissue that connected us all.Had weight and size not been an issue, I would’ve packed a small screening room in my luggage.In lieu of that, I had an iPad, iPod and iPhone prepped with enough downloads to get me through 2020. What if I found myself on consecutive five-hour flights with nothing to entertain me? How else would I make my way through a hundred dinners alone in unfamiliar cities?I was armoring myself with the familiar, in my native language — movies, music, TV shows, books — to ward off my fears of everything new and scary. After an exhausting day of speaking Spanish in Costa Rica, I could unwind with an episode of “Orange Is the New Black.” Stuck in the limbo of a logistical snag? That was just the right amount of time to indulge in a rom-com on Netflix, or text with my friends back home about that rom-com on Netflix.Then, on the first plane ride of my trip, from New York to New Orleans, I was too nervous and excited to look at my iPad. More plane and train and bus and car rides went by, and the iPad stayed in the bag, as I slept, or worked, or watched incredible scenery. Soon it became dead weight, an annoyance that only left my bag at airport security checks. I barely noticed when I forgot it in a Denver hotel room; then, five months in, I left it at a friend’s house in Los Angeles and never missed it.That worry of being bored never came up again. Culture was all around me. I went to more museums that I had in five years. (Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo and the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver were highlights). I never heard Ariana Grande’s song thanking her exes, but I can say definitively that “Despacito” was the most popular song on the planet in 2018. There are talented street musicians everywhere from Belgrade, Serbia, to La Paz, Bolivia, who can play it ably on everything from accordions to trumpets.It wasn’t until old friends started tweeting out their Top 10 lists for the year that I realized I’d seen only six movies, all on planes or Netflix: “Mamma Mia 2,” “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” “Set It Up,” that one where the Rock goes “Die Hard” on a skyscraper, and two Netflix Christmas movies.They’d been delightful, but the real treat came this January on the plane back from Taiwan to the United States at the end of my 52 Places trip, when “Crazy Rich Asians” popped up on my seatback screen. It was just over six months since it came out and I squealed with excitement to the nice Chinese girl sitting next to me. She didn’t speak much English, but she nodded, smiling, and turned on a Chinese-language soap opera for herself.For months, I’d been devouring Twitter threads and think pieces about the impact of “Crazy Rich Asians.” I’d followed along as three Korean friends from New York magazine tweeted about seeing it together, and weeping, for the third time. Over the years I’d written about the lack of realistic Asian representation in American pop culture because I’d felt it, too. A history teacher saying “ching-chong-chong” and slanting his eyes while teaching my class about China in middle school. Asian men like my dad being used as the butt of sexual jokes.So much of coming home after a profound experience like a long trip, especially one taken alone, is reckoning with how much you’ve changed and how much everything you left behind has stayed the same. But while I was gone, Hollywood had changed.I watched the penultimate scene three times: Hollywood’s new star, Henry Golding, rushes onto an airplane to get back the girl (a radiant Constance Wu), in a clichéd moment straight out of a dozen rom-coms. It didn’t feel clichéd or over the top. I’d just come from two months of tasting the richness of Asian cultures in India, Bhutan, Japan, China, South Korea, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, and that scene felt right, like it had a place in the world I’d been fortunate enough to see over the last year. And then I watched the whole movie over again.A WEEK AFTER I GOT BACK, I went to Utah for the tail end of the Sundance Film Festival, which I’d attended for years as a January ritual for work. Some people were surprised that I’d headed back on the road so soon, but wandering around Park City, puzzling out how to make it to screenings in the middle of a snowstorm, felt more like home to me than the apartment I hadn’t lived in for a year.Home is full of uncertainty and questions about the future. Crying alone in a dark theater, now that is something I know how to do.At first, my selections were shaky. I started off with a dull Keira Knightley whistle-blower drama I’d picked on reflex, because I was used to seeing movies with stars I could interview. Soon, though, I found myself drawn to foreign dramas and documentaries that could take me back to the places I’d been and missed so much. A rom-com, “Top End Wedding,” transported me to Darwin, Australia, and into the lives of Aboriginal families like the ones I had briefly met in October. “Monos,” a spectacularly shot Colombian psychodrama about child soldiers, brought me deep into the jungles of a country I long to revisit. “Midnight Traveler,” shot entirely on smartphones by a family of Afghan refugees, showed me a side of border crossings I’d never encountered.One night, the young filmmakers and journalists in our rental condo were having a party. I took a bus back there after watching a harrowing documentary, “One Child Nation,” about Chinese population control policy, and found myself standing in the street, unable to go in. Heavy snow was falling, turning the light from the streetlamps into lace. Music wafted down the stairs, and in the window I could see silhouettes of happy revelers with red Solo cups. A coming-of-age drama about a young Muslim girl was showing at a theater not too far away. Another dark room, another world to visit. I turned around and got on a bus."

Do not expect her to post mirror selfies from Buckingham Palace.The queen’s first post was a picture of a letter that was sent to her great-great-grandfather by Charles Babbage, a 19th-century mathematician, inventor and computer science pioneer.ImageA screengrab taken from the royal family’s Instagram account shows the first post published by the queen.CreditEPA, via ShutterstockThe post was projected onto a large screen at the Science Museum in London and was met by large applause from the audience.

She posted her first tweet in 2014.The purpose of her visit to the Science Museum on Thursday was to announce a summer exhibition celebrating technology and communications.Shared with 4.7 million followers of the royal family’s official Instagram account, the queen’s first post collected thousands of likes and comments.Instagram users praised the post as appropriate for throwback Thursday, a social media tradition in which people post nostalgic pictures of their past with the hashtag #tbt.Some expressed concern that the queen might face online abuse from trolls.“I really hope she doesn’t use social media platforms anymore,” wrote one user. “She needs to be kept pure.”This week, Buckingham Palace issued social media guidelines for its followers after users posted abusive comments directed at Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, and Catherine, the duchess of Cambridge.The royal family has millions of followers across several social media accounts and platforms. The family’s communications staff spends hours each week moderating racist and sexist comments that tend to pit the duchesses against each other, a spokesperson for the Palace said.“We ask that anyone engaging with our social media channels shows courtesy, kindness and respect for all other members of our social media communities,” the guidelines read.“We reserve the right to determine, at our discretion, whether contributions to our social media channels breach our guidelines.

He stood up in the middle of our conversation and his security agents confiscated our television cameras, the memory cards and our cellphones. Yes, Mr. Maduro stole the interview so nobody could watch it.We got the interview the old fashioned way: by making a phone call and requesting it. A producer from Univision — the television network where I’ve worked since 1984 — contacted the government’s communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, and asked if Mr. Maduro wanted to do the interview. The leader said: “Come to Caracas.” And so we did, with official entry papers in hand.The interview started on Monday evening, three hours late, at the Miraflores Palace. Mr. Maduro had spoken a few minutes before with Tom Llamas of ABC News, and he seemed to be in a good mood. The humanitarian aid that the political opposition — with the help of an international coalition — had tried to get into the country over the Colombian and Brazilian borders had been largely stopped, and Mr. Maduro felt emboldened. This was supposed to be a good day.But it wasn’t. The first question I asked Mr. Maduro was whether I should call him “Presidente” or “Dictador,” as many Venezuelans do. I confronted him about human rights violations and cases of torture that have been reported by Human Rights Watch, and with the existence of political prisoners. I questioned his claim that he had won the 2013 and the 2018 presidential elections without fraud and, most important, his assurances that Venezuela was not experiencing a humanitarian crisis. That’s when I opened up my iPad.The day before I had recorded on my cellphone three young men looking for food on the back of a garbage truck in a poor neighborhood minutes away from the presidential palace. I showed those images to Mr. Maduro. Each frame contradicted his narrative of a prosperous and progressive Venezuela 20 years after the revolution. That’s when he broke.About 17 minutes into the interview, Mr. Maduro stood up, comically tried to block the images on my iPad and declared that the interview was over. “That’s what dictators do,” I told him.A few seconds after Mr. Maduro left, Mr. Rodríguez, the communications minister, told me that his government had not authorized the interview and he ordered his security agents to confiscate my team’s four cameras and other equipment and the video cards on which we had recorded the conversation.Somebody shouted to take me out of the presidential palace immediately, but instead two security agents escorted me to a little room where they ordered me to give them my cellphone and its password. They were concerned that I had recorded the audio of the interview and they didn’t want any leaks. But I refused. Soon after, my colleague María Martínez, one of the best producers in the country, was thrown into the same room. María, to the security agents’ frustration, managed to make a quick phone call to Univision News’s president, who warned the State Department and many news organizations about what was happening. The rest of our team, I later learned — five Univision employees — were taken to the press room, and then out to a government bus.ImageJorge Ramos at the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday.CreditCarlos Garcia Rawlins/ReutersIn our little room, someone turned off all the lights, and a group of agents came in and forcefully took away my cellphone and my backpack. They furiously went through all my personal stuff. They patted me down from head to toe. María went through the same humiliating experience with a female officer. I asked if we were being detained. They said no — but still they didn’t let us leave the room.Finally they told María and me to join our colleagues on the bus. They said they wanted to take us to our hotel. But we refused again. At that point we were very concerned about our safety and the possibility of being taken to a detention center or an even darker place.We were taken to the street, where Mr. Rodríguez came out to complain about the interview and the way we had conducted ourselves. I told him that our job was to ask questions, and that they had stolen our interview and our equipment. By then, we later realized, the first reports about our detention were already being published. They couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. It was about 9:30 p.m., more than two hours after the end of the interview.Our driver, who had been waiting all this time on one of the side streets, suddenly appeared. At that point, the same people who had detained us wanted us to leave. Fast. And so we did. We piled into the car and went back to the hotel. Members of the government’s intelligence agency cordoned off the hotel so we couldn’t leave. A few hours later, an immigration official came to inform us that we would be expelled from the country in the morning. Around 1 a.m., a self-described “captain” — one of the men who had detained me at the presidential palace — came to my room and returned my cellphone in a plastic bag. All of its contents had been deleted. I assume they had first hacked into whatever they could. We experienced only a taste of the harassment and abuse that Venezuelan journalists have been suffering for years. We have two Venezuelans in our crew — the correspondent Francisco Urreiztieta and the cameraman Edgar Trujillo — and they would have faced terrible risks if they stayed in their own country. Luckily, we all made it safely back to Miami. But our cameras and the records of our interview remained behind. What is Mr. Maduro so afraid of? He should release the interview for the world to see. If he does not, all he has proved is that he is behaving exactly like a dictator.

5c8af58049f0eacbf105d2af,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/business/boeing-737-software-update.html,"Weeks after a deadly crash involving a Boeing plane last October, company officials met separately with the pilot unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. The officials said they planned to update the software for their 737 Max jets, the plane involved in the disaster, by around the end of 2018.It was the last time the Southwest pilots union heard from Boeing, and months later, the carriers are still waiting for a fix. After a second 737 Max crashed, on Sunday in Ethiopia, United States regulators said the software update would be ready by April.“Boeing was going to have a software fix in the next five to six weeks,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a Boeing 737 captain. “We told them, ‘Yeah, it can’t drag out.’ And well, here we are.”This delay is now part of the intense scrutiny over Boeing’s response after the first air disaster, a Lion Air accident that killed 189 people in Indonesia. The second crash, involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people, bore similarities to the first, pointing to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.The planned fix was “designed to detect the problem,” said Jon Weaks, the president of Southwest’s pilot union, “and keep it from recurring.” Boeing officials told Southwest union leaders that they didn’t believe any extra training was necessary beyond informing the pilots of how the software fix would function.The potential similarities between the two crashes were central to regulators’ decision to ground the whole 737 Max line, a family of planes that has been in service for nearly two years. Boeing is now in damage control mode, as carriers cancel flights and try to limit disruptions. Boeing declined to comment for this article.Along with the grounding, Boeing has been forced to halt deliveries of the jets, one of its best-selling planes. Authorities are trying to determine exactly what went wrong, while a senior Democratic lawmaker is planning to examine Boeing’s communications with its regulators.VideoBoeing introduced the 737 Max as a reliable fuel- and cost-efficient solution to air travel in the 21st century. After two fatal Max crashes, all of the Max aircraft in the world are believed to have been grounded.CreditCreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesThe lawmaker, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the chairman of the House transportation committee, has said he will investigate the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification of the 737 Max, including why the regulator did not mandate more substantial training for pilots.To qualify to fly the plane, the pilots at American were given a 56-minute iPad training and about a dozen white papers on the differences between the Max aircraft and previous 737 jets, union officials said. Mr. Weaks of Southwest said his members were trained with an e-learning module on a company-issued iPad that consisted of under three hours of video presentations.Both Southwest and American now say they expect to have simulators including the 737 Max systems by the end of this year. American ordered the simulator after the Lion Air crash.The meetings last year between Boeing officials and the unions were cordial but direct. The pilots from Southwest and American who met with Boeing were frustrated that they hadn’t been notified of the newly installed software system in the 737 Max planes before the crash in Indonesia. The so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS, is an automated system intended to prevent the plane from stalling.“It was a very frank discussion,” said the American union’s safety chairman, Mr. Michaelis. “This is to our knowledge the first time pilots were not informed of a major system on an airplane that could affect flight controls.”The pilots demanded more information about the system. Mr. Michaelis said it had been mentioned once in the appendix of the official aircraft manual, but without any explanation about what it was or did.In response to the pilots’ request, Mr. Michaelis said, Boeing concurred. The company has since provided the American pilots with basic information about MCAS, but it hasn’t updated the official manual with a full explanation about how it works.Mr. Michaelis said Boeing had partly attributed the delay to the recent government shutdown, which caused a backlog at the F.A.A. Daniel K. Elwell, the acting administrator of the F.A.A., said on Wednesday that the 35-day partial government shutdown that stretched from December until late January “did not cause any delay in work on the software.”For days after the Ethiopian crash, Boeing and the F.A.A. stood by the safety of the plane. As regulators around the world grounded the plane, the F.A.A. resisted doing the same.ImageA Boeing 737 Max 8 at Miami International Airport on Thursday. Some of the jets were allowed to fly to be better situated for long-term parking.CreditJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesMr. DeFazio said he stepped out of a hearing on Wednesday morning to speak with Mr. Elwell about the plane. Mr. DeFazio said Mr. Elwell assured him there was no cause for alarm.Within hours, President Trump announced the Max would be grounded.“One of my staff, her phone went ‘bing’ and there it was,” Mr. DeFazio said.Mr. Elwell and the F.A.A.’s top safety official, Ali Bahrami, visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to brief members of the House and Senate about the agency’s decision-making after the crash in Ethiopia. Mr. Elwell also made the rounds on morning television shows as his agency continued to face questions about its response to the crash as well as the earlier accident in Indonesia.“We’re confident in the safety of the airplane,” he said on “CBS This Morning.” “What we don’t know is if there’s a linkage between those two accidents, and now that we have the new evidence to suggest there very well may be, we grounded the airplanes to find the linkage.”Mr. Trump, at the White House on Thursday, said he hoped the Boeing planes would be back in the air soon. “They have to figure it out fast,” he said. “They know that. They’re under great pressure.”The three American airlines that operate 737 Max aircraft — American and Southwest operate Max 8s and United flies the Max 9 — have scrambled to limit any disruptions caused by the groundings. The airlines have shifted other available aircraft to replace the jets, canceled less popular flights to use those aircraft for busier Max routes, and rebooked some fliers on other airlines. Cancellations will vary by the day based on the availability of other aircraft.American, which has 24 Max 8 jets, canceled 85 flights out of 6,700 on Thursday, but it was able to limit the disruption by scrapping emptier flights on routes where it could rebook those passengers on later flights. For instance, it canceled flights from Dallas to Sacramento and Tucson, booking those fliers on later planes, and used those aircraft to instead operate busier routes between Miami and New York.Southwest, which has 34 Max 8 jets, said it was able to shift enough planes around to cancel just 39 out of its 4,000 scheduled flights on Thursday. And United, which has 14 Max 9 jets, was able to avoid any cancellations from the grounding on Thursday because it shifted many planes from its hub in Denver, where a snowstorm was already disrupting flights.There were still some 737 Max jets flying in American skies on Thursday. The F.A.A. granted the airlines permission to ferry their empty Max jets to new airports for long-term parking. American flew its planes from places like Miami, New York and Tampa, Fla., to places like Tulsa, Orlando, Fla., and Mobile, Ala."
5c3cad123a125f5075c044fe,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/lausd-teachers-strike.html,"LOS ANGELES — More than 30,000 Los Angeles public-school teachers began a strike on Monday, the first in three decades in the district. Holding plastic-covered signs on rain-drenched picket lines across the city, they demanded higher pay, smaller classes and more support staff in schools.The strike effectively shut down learning for roughly 500,000 students at 900 schools in the district, the second-largest public school system in the nation. The schools remained open, staffed by substitutes hired by the city, but many parents chose to keep their children at home, either out of support for the strike or because they did not want them inside schools with a skeletal staff.With negotiations apparently at a standstill, the strike could last days or even weeks.The decision to walk off the job came after months of negotiations between the teachers’ union, United Teachers Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Although educators on all sides agree California should spend more money on education, the union and the district are locked in a bitter feud about how Los Angeles should use the money it already gets.Although district officials have agreed to come closer to meeting some of the union’s demands, they say fulfilling all of them would bankrupt the system, which is already strained by rising health care and pension costs.Several Democratic politicians voiced their support for the strike Monday, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is considering a run for president. But Gov. Gavin Newsom, who took office just a week ago, was more measured.“This impasse is disrupting the lives of too many kids and their families,” he said in a statement. “I strongly urge all parties to go back to the negotiating table and find an immediate path forward that puts kids back into classrooms and provides parents certainty.”The sprawling district goes far beyond the Los Angeles city limits, stretching some 720 square miles from wealthy coastal areas like Pacific Palisades to working-class southeast suburbs like Montebello. It is overwhelmingly low income; more than 80 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. And Latinos make up roughly 75 percent of all students, while whites and African-Americans each account for less than 10 percent of enrollment.On Monday, we went to schools across the district to talk with teachers on the picket lines, as well as the students and parents who joined them.Inside Schools, iPads and Crowded AuditoriumsAt Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools, a large campus in Koreatown, hundreds of teachers and supporters gathered before sunrise, holding signs declaring “We demand respect” and “Striking for our students.” By 8 a.m., dozens of students and parents had gathered along the sidewalk to support the teachers, but there was also a steady stream of students entering the campus, which houses several small schools.Sophie Chiang, a 10th-grade student, arrived well before the first bell. “Oh God, it’s really happening,” she said as she approached the line of teachers in red ponchos shouting “Whose schools? Our schools!” The campus security guard who is usually at the entrance was not at his post.At nearby John Burroughs Middle School, the classrooms mostly sat empty Monday. Roughly 40 percent of the school’s 1,700 students showed up in the morning and were sent to the gymnasium, auditorium and multipurpose rooms to work independently on their school-provided iPads. A school administrator and substitute teacher were stationed in each large space, trying to keep order for hundreds of children.ImageTeachers marched through Los Angeles on Monday. Schools remained open, however, staffed by substitutes hired by the city.CreditJenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times“We’re trying to make the best learning environment with what we have,” said Steve Martinez, the school’s principal. “It’s not an ideal situation.”Mr. Martinez had asked the district for 65 substitute teachers, but received only six. By lunchtime, the rooms were rowdy but under control — though several iPads and phones clearly displayed games that would not be considered educational.Still, Matias Garcia, a sixth-grade student, texted his mother asking her to come get him by 11 a.m.“Nobody is listening, it’s loud and we spent like an hour taking attendance,” Matias said.His mother, Lilly Santaniello, works part-time as a lawyer and hired a relative to come take care of her other sons. Matias said he had a plan for the afternoon: video games and sleep. — JENNIFER MEDINAPriced Out of the NeighborhoodIn a downpour, dozens of teachers, wearing ponchos and waving green and red placards — “We stand with L.A. teachers” — picketed outside the Paul Revere Charter Middle School in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. One teacher waved a large American flag, others held bullhorns.Steven Bilek, a union representative and math and science teacher at Paul Revere, said that for some teachers the main issue was pay, but others were just as concerned with class size or the lack of support staff like librarians or counselors.“The idea that teachers just want raises is just not true,” he said.Paul Revere is a charter school affiliated with the district, and students attend from more than a hundred ZIP codes around Los Angeles, he said. The school is in one of the city’s wealthiest areas, and most if not all of the teachers cannot afford to live nearby.“I don’t think any of our teachers live in this area,” Mr. Bilek said. “We’re lucky to live within an hour.”Some parents and students joined the teachers on the picket line. “We are here fighting for the future of public education,” said Dennise Weir, whose children, Olivia and Edward, were by her side.Ms. Weir lives in Beverly Hills and can afford private school, but she sends her children to public school because, she said, “they are the last civic institutions that are available to everyone.”There are about 2,100 students enrolled at Paul Revere, but on Monday about a third showed up for class.Each grade was gathered in large assemblies, overseen by the few adults on duty — substitute teachers, campus aides and technicians. On a normal day the school has 95 teachers, but on Monday there were only 10 adults on hand with teaching credentials. — TIM ARANGOImageA picket line outside Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools, a large campus in Koreatown.CreditJenna Schoenefeld for The New York TimesHow Does Teaching in L.A. Stack Up?Union leaders say teaching in the city is unsustainable, with salaries far outpaced by a high cost of living, large class sizes and not enough resources to help struggling students. Here’s a look at how Los Angeles Unified compares nationally:Teacher pay: The average teacher salary in Los Angeles Unified was $75,000 during the 2017-2018 school year, according to the California Department of Education — far higher than the national average of around $59,000.But Los Angeles is an expensive place to live. When you compare the city with other high-priced urban centers, its teacher pay no longer looks so extraordinary. The average salary in San Francisco last year was $73,000, while New York City teachers earned an average salary of $88,000, according to their union.Beginning salaries matter, too, for attracting and retaining young talent. In Los Angeles, the entry-level teacher salary was $44,000 last year, compared with $47,000 in San Francisco and $57,000 in New York City.Los Angeles Unified has, so far, offered teachers a 6 percent raise.Class size: An independent report noted that the two sides can’t agree on how to calculate class size, but it is clear that classes in Los Angeles are big. The district has offered to cap classes at 35 students in grades 4-6; 39 students in middle- and high-school English and math; and 32 students at elementary schools that serve many low-income children. Nationally, average class sizes in urban schools ranged between 16 and 28 students, depending on grade level and how the school was organized, according to the National Teacher and Principal Survey for 2015-2016.Professional staff beyond the classroom: One of the union’s main demands is for the district to hire more guidance counselors, nurses and librarians. With increased pressure over the last two decades to raise standardized test scores, many public schools have funneled funds into math and reading instruction, and suffer from a dearth of such professional staff.California’s situation is worse than the national average, with more than 600 students per counselor across the state and more than 500 per counselor in Los Angeles County, according to an analysis from the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health. There are nearly 2,000 students per every school nurse in the county.Los Angeles Unified has offered to add an additional academic counselor to each district high school and to make sure each elementary school has daily nursing services. The district also offered to ensure library services at each middle school. — DANA GOLDSTEIN Making NoiseAs the final bell sounded at Gerald A. Lawson Academy of the Arts, Mathematics and Science in South Los Angeles on Monday afternoon, striking teachers formed a circle outside the exit and chanted call-and-response songs in the rain. A handful of students lingered with their parents, singing along.Susie Chavez ducked under a teacher’s umbrella, belting out “We are the students! The mighty, mighty students” with her arms around her children.Ms. Chavez said she would keep bringing them to school no matter how long the strike went on because “the teachers are on strike, not my kids.”In the car pool line, students in their raincoats packed snugly into Cristina Aguilar’s S.U.V. While she said she supported the strike, Ms. Aguilar wanted to avoid creating a truancy record for her younger children, in kindergarten and third grade. Her eldest had stayed home.She was taking a wait-and-see approach to school attendance during the strike. “If there’s no teachers, there’s no point in bringing them,” Ms. Aguilar said. — LOUIS KEENE"
5ca64b1c49f0eacbf1f80f3c,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/04/business/04reuters-usa-funds-cannabis-analysis.html,"NEW YORK — U.S. companies cannot stop talking about marijuana, hoping in part they can catch investor interest as the booming economy around the drug lifts revenues throughout the supply chain. With the recreational use of cannabis now legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia and medical marijuana legal in 23 states, marijuana is on its way to becoming an $80 billion industry in the United States by 2030, according to estimates by Cowen Inc. That outsized growth is starting to bleed into adjacent industries ranging from energy to packaging to point-of-sale technology whose products are used in the production or sale of marijuana. As investors circle the cannabis space, supply-chain companies are showing a new willingness to associate themselves with an industry that remained largely illegal a decade ago. Cryogenic equipment manufacturer Chart Industries Inc told analysts on Feb. 14 that ""cannabis has double-digit growth potential for us"" as more grow houses use liquefied carbon dioxide in the extraction of marijuana. Point of sale company Socket Mobile Inc said on Feb. 13 that cannabis dispensaries are ""ideally suited to iPad-based point-of-sale solutions for accounting and regulatory compliance."" And private security company Brinks Co said on Feb. 6 that its North America segment should have ""another strong year"" due in part to the growth of the cannabis industry. ""You're starting to see a repurposing of the supply chain and that could give some companies another leg of growth,"" said Chris Retzler, a portfolio manager of the Needham Growth fund. ""This has the potential to drive revenues higher and lead to some earnings surprises.""HOW BIG A BOOST?In a sense, many companies are looking to replicate the strategy of lawn and garden products company Scotts Miracle-Gro Co, which has transformed itself over the last four years into a player in the cannabis industry by focusing on the sales of lighting, fertilizer and growing systems specifically for marijuana. Shares of the company, which acquired a competitor in hydroponics for $450 million in 2018, are up nearly 30% for the year to date, a rally about double that of the benchmark S&P 500. But just how much revenue will come from cannabis-related sales into businesses that are further afield from the plant remains unclear.For supply chain companies like Chart Industries, revenue from cannabis ""realistically could be a couple of percentage points a year,"" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. Yet that does not mean it will be insignificant, he said. ""In the Gold Rush it was the people who were making the picks and shovels for gold miners that made the most money. This is a case of a company that has absolutely nothing to do with cannabis historically, yet it's benefiting from the picks-and-shovels opportunity,"" he said. Jillian Evanko, the chief executive of Chart, told Reuters in an interview that cannabis is now the fastest-growing segment of its business, and that the company has undisclosed products in its pipeline made specifically for use in the marijuana industry. ""Historically we did not focus on these markets, but now we have dedicated teams both commercially and technical (engineering/product development) to develop these markets further,"" she said.NO LONGER OPEN SECRETThe outsized investor interest in cannabis and growing recognition of cannabis as a therapeutic drug may prompt more company management teams to openly discuss how their products are used by the marijuana industry in hopes of attracting shareholders, said Brett Hundley, an analyst at Seaport Global. Some, like alcoholic beverage company Constellation Brands Inc and tobacco company Altria Group Inc, are making investments into the cannabis industry to proactively move into an industry that poses a threat to their existing business lines, he said. Yet others are starting to discuss cannabis as a way to tap in to changing attitudes toward marijuana, Hundley said. ""I was on a Balchem conference call a few weeks ago and we asked the company if they were considering getting into cannabis, and the CEO talked about how we've been supplying minerals to grow houses,"" he said. ""I literally watched the stock jump 2% from the time I asked the question to the time he answered it. Anything associated with cannabis today is getting an increase in market value.""

Taking his place is Sean Giancola, The Post’s chief revenue officer.Mr. Angelo, 45, started out as a stringer for Page Six, the paper’s saucy, celebrity-skewering gossip column. He became a staff reporter in 1999 and quickly moved up the ranks. By age 27 he was dispatching reporters to murder scenes as metropolitan editor.In 2009, he was promoted to executive editor, and took charge of The Post’s digital operation. Two years later, when journalism circles considered the iPad to be the delivery system of the future, he founded The Daily, a tablet-only subscription publication. Even with a $30 million budget, it crashed and burned, but that did not stop Mr. Angelo’s rise.He became publisher and chief executive of The Post in 2012. In 2017, he created “Page Six TV,” a syndicated daily TV show along the lines of “Entertainment Tonight” and “Access Hollywood.”“After 20 years at The Post, it is time for me to move on and let someone else write the next chapter of this storied institution,” Mr. Angelo said in a statement. “I love The Post with my whole heart and wish my colleagues all the best.”Robert J. Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation, praised Mr. Angelo for his “varied contributions to our company as a journalist, editor and publisher, and for his leadership during the digital transformation of The Post.”A native of Manhattan, Mr. Angelo grew up on Central Park West. His mother, Judy Hart Angelo, co-wrote the theme songs for “Cheers,” “Mr. Belvedere” and “Punky Brewster.” His father, John Angelo, founded the investment firm Angelo, Gordon & Company.Mr. Angelo has known Rupert Murdoch’s younger son, James R. Murdoch, since kindergarten. The two attended Harvard together, and Mr. Angelo was the best man in the younger Mr. Murdoch’s wedding. They are still close.James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, is expected to step away from the family media empire in the coming months, once the i’s are dotted in the $71.3 billion merger agreement between Fox and the Walt Disney Company. A former chief executive of News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch has had political differences with his brother, Lachlan, and his father, Rupert, who both lean more conservative.As staff members learned of Mr. Angelo’s departure, they speculated that a former Post editor in chief, Col Allan, was preparing to come out of retirement. A veteran journalist from Rupert Murdoch’s home country of Australia, Mr. Allan served as editor in chief of the tabloid from 2001 to 2016 as part of a 42-year career at News Corporation, which included a long stint at The Daily Telegraph in Sydney. He was replaced at The Post by the paper’s current editor in chief, Stephen Lynch.Mr. Giancola, after holding executive positions at AOL Advertising, American Express and Time Inc., joined The Post in 2015."
5ca02bf949f0eacbf1c7095f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/sports/ncaa-tournament-texas-tech-gonzaga.html,"ANAHEIM, Calif. — The Texas Tech men’s basketball team carries around a mantra like a chip on its shoulder: The secret’s in the dirt. It is a particularly appealing message — that success is usually found by getting your hands in the muck — especially to the ears of basketball mutts and vagabonds, and a star whose own father questioned why he would want to stay home in Lubbock.So when a moment of truth arrived on Saturday, and top-seeded Gonzaga — with its free-flowing offense and shotmakers all over the court — readied for a final charge, the Red Raiders found success by doing what they do best: digging in.The Red Raiders, leaning on their defense as they have all season, clamped down on Gonzaga and rode a pair of ice-cold 3-pointers from Davide Moretti and some cool free-throw shooting to a 75-69 victory in the West Region final of the N.C.A.A. tournament.The win sends No. 3 Texas Tech to the Final Four in Minneapolis, the first trip in team history.“We did it, baby,” Jarrett Culver said as he embraced his doubting father, Hiawatha, before cutting down the nets with his teammates and retreating to the locker room where the players danced to Lil Yachty’s “Minnesota.”The Red Raiders had hit a high-water mark last season when they reached a regional final before losing to Villanova, the eventual champion. With Zhaire Smith, a lottery pick in the N.B.A. draft, and five seniors departed, they were unlikely candidates to return.But the addition of two graduate transfers — guard Matt Mooney from South Dakota and forward Tariq Owens from St. John’s — and the development of the sophomores Moretti and Culver helped the Red Raiders to a Big 12 co-championship, their first in 23 years.They seamlessly blended into the system of Coach Chris Beard, a former assistant under Bob Knight who cut his teeth as acoach at the junior college and Division II levels before getting his break at Arkansas-Little Rock.ImageRui Hachimura (21) led Gonzaga with 22 points in his team’s loss. He is a key player N.B.A. scouts have been watching.CreditHarry How/Getty ImagesA summer retreat, at a camp in West Texas that was out of cellphone range, helped the players bond, and a closed-door scrimmage with Houston and a strong December showing against Duke at Madison Square Garden forged their belief in themselves.But their resolve was tested on Saturday. Gonzaga, with its ball screens, took advantage of switches to get the ball to its two N.B.A.-bound big men: Brandon Clarke and Rui Hachimura. And the Zags successfully pushed the pace, surging to a 37-35 lead at halftime.In the second half, Texas Tech came out in a zone for a few possessions, then rarely switched and resisted the temptation to run with the Zags, controlling the pace to its liking. Then, with the score tied at 58-58, the Red Raiders defense clamped down — holding the Zags without a basket for nearly four minutes.Meanwhile, Mooney snaked into the paint for a basket that put Texas Tech ahead, 60-58, and Moretti sank a 3-pointer to extend the advantage to 63-58. But Clarke narrowed the gap to 63-60 with two free throws, bringing the Zags’ sizable crowd into the game.As Culver dribbled the shot clock down at the top of the arc, he glanced to his right and gave a knowing look to Moretti. With the defenders beginning to pinch Culver as the shot clock ran down, he flicked a pass to Moretti, who never hesitated, sinking another 3-pointer to put the Red Raiders ahead, 66-60, with 1:50 to play.Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.“I thought he was going to pass me and I was ready for it. That’s the chemistry between us,” said Moretti, who watched Villanova’s buzzer-beating championship in 2016 late at night on his iPad at his home in Bologna, Italy. “He knows when I want the ball, and I know when he’s going to pass it to me.”The Zags, who were the nation’s most efficient offensive team, made only 12 of 33 in the second half, and they turned the ball over 16 times for the game.“They are really good at reaching, poking and digging things out there,” Gonzaga Coach Mark Few said of the Texas Tech defense. “This is the best team I’ve ever had for taking care of the ball. So it’s real. That defense is real.”So, too, are the Red Raiders, who will not only continue looking for secrets in the dirt, but in Minneapolis, too."
5c79c86449f0eacbf105af6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/business/addictive-technology.html,"HALF MOON BAY, Calif. — See if you can get to the end of this article without being interrupted by another piece of technology.Tristan Harris, a former Google executive, said it could be a challenge, and he compared phones and apps to slot machines that command attention and endlessly distract.In an unusual twist, Mr. Harris discussed electronic addiction at the recent New York Times New Work Summit on a stage set with candles, as the electricity in the Half Moon Bay area had gone out.When Mr. Harris worked at Google in 2013, he created a 141-page slide show that acted as a reckoning for the internet giant. What was first shared with around 10 colleagues was later viewed by tens of thousands of employees and others.“Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25-35) working at 3 companies (Google, Apple, Facebook) had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention,” the slide show read.“Think about that for a second,” he wrote. “We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.”Seven years later, worries about the addictive nature of technology have multiplied. Apple and Google have introduced tools to try to help people better understand, and curb, their technology use.VideoMeredith Whittaker, AI Now Institute co-founder and co-director, speaking at The New York Times’s New Work Summit/Leading in the Age of A.I., said tech employees have a basic right to know the consequences of their efforts.CreditCreditMike Cohen for The New York TimesTop executives in Silicon Valley are increasingly voicing their concerns about technology’s influence on young minds. Apple’s Timothy D. Cook told The Guardian he didn’t want his nephew on any social platforms. Steve Jobs didn’t want his children near iPads. Some parents are asking nannies to shield children from their phones.“Compared to 20 or 30 years ago, technology is eating up every single area of public life,” Mr. Harris said in a conversation with Meredith Whittaker of the AI Now Institute and the reporter Nellie Bowles of The Times. “From our elections, to our media, to our culture, to our public sphere, to our conversations, to our children’s development — these are all areas of life that technology has gobbled up.”In 2016, he left Google to become a co-founder and the executive director of what is now known as the Center for Humane Technology, an organization that is calling for companies to build systems and business models “that more deeply align with our humanity and how we want to live.”Mr. Harris and Ms. Whittaker say the onus to create meaningful change in the technology world must come from within and outside of companies like Apple, Facebook, Google that have a large hand in creating the expanding attention crisis.As the lead of Google’s Open Research group and an A.I. researcher at New York University, Ms. Whittaker has a unique perspective on the issues and how they could be solved from within and beyond Silicon Valley.“People are recognizing that there are issues, and they want to change it,” Ms. Whittaker said. “But has the objective function of these corporations changed? They’re still major corporations at a time of neoliberal capitalism that are optimizing their products for shareholder value.”She continued to say that users and employees must demand accountability. But government regulation is also overdue, she said.“We need regulation,” she said. “Make them open up trade secrecy provisions so we can audit these systems when they are used in public life.”Ms. Whittaker proposed those regulations as part of the 2018 AI Now Report released by New York University in December. “Government regulation is an important component,” according to the report, “but leading companies in the A.I. industry also need internal accountability structures that go beyond ethics guidelines.”Ms. Whittaker and Mr. Harris said they believed employees within the tech industry want to see specific guidelines put in place.“We have allies throughout the whole industry because no one wants bad outcomes,” Mr. Harris said. No one wants to contribute to a system in which children have poor mental health, he added. “No one wants to contribute to a system where you destabilize democracies or cause genocides across the world.”Once employees see how the current structures can lead to such problems, they ask one question, he said: “How can I help?”"
5c2fd3e23a125f5075c02e8b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-china.html,"Do not pity Timothy D. Cook. He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apple’s chief executive. He is regarded as one of business’s best bosses, and runs a company with a beloved brand and $130 billion in cash. Even so, he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple’s corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons:1. His bet on China may be backfiring. The signature innovation of Apple’s late co-founder, Mr. Jobs, was the iPhone. Mr. Cook’s has been his ability to crack the Chinese market. That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass $1 trillion in market value by August last year.But now it might be backfiring. The Chinese economy is sputtering, and the trade war between the United States and China isn’t getting much better. With most adults — even children — in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones, Apple has relied on China to keep growing. On Wednesday, Mr. Cook announced a potential drop of 25 percent in sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apple’s competitors.Apple’s share price dropped nearly 10 percent on Thursday, but bounced back about 4 percent on Friday.2. People are sticking with their old iPhones. People aren’t buying iPhones the way they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors. The problem is, many people aren’t. Mr. Cook said this week that customers were waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fueled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.That presents a dilemma for Mr. Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apple’s business. But the ugly truth might be: Longer-lasting iPhones are bad for business.3. President Trump knows where iPhones are made. Apple’s sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of history’s most popular products. And Mr. Cook, who was Apple’s operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.But it soon might be in the cross hairs of President Trump. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China — and Mr. Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying he’d force it to start making its products closer to home. While president, he has said Apple plans “to build a lot of plants” in the United States — even though it hasn’t announced plans to do so. (Mr. Cook hasn’t publicly corrected him.)While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Mr. Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China’s scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world’s most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.Cozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple’s employees in liberal Silicon Valley — even some of its customers. So far, Mr. Cook has walked a fine line, holding cordial private meetings with Mr. Trump while also publicly criticizing his policies, without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employees.On Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United States.“Don’t forget this: Apple makes their product in China,” he said. “I told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot: ‘Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.’”He went on to say China, not the United States, gets the biggest benefit from Apple. “They build their product mostly in China.”ImageOutside an Apple store in Beijing. Until recently, the Chinese market was a major source of growth in iPhone sales. CreditGilles Sabrié for The New York Times4. Apple has clammed up on iPhone unit sales.Two months ago, Mr. Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apple’s earnings call: The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sold. “The number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,” he reasoned.Apple had reported the metric for years, highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales. But those sales have leveled off over the last two quarters. In an earnings call at the end of January, Mr. Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing. How much? That will be up to people outside the company to figure out. Investors were displeased — even before the surprise news about sales in China. Apple’s shares have since dropped more than 30 percent, shaving $380 billion off its market value. The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than longtime rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent company.5. Innovation is hard to do over and over again.Mr. Jobs presided over a historic run of innovation in his second tour at Apple, from the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. In his seven years as chief executive, Mr. Cook has announced the Apple Watch and AirPods, which have done well but have been far from iPhone-like industry changers.So what’s next? That is Mr. Cook’s biggest challenge.Apple has been working on artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology — but most industry insiders believe it is way behind competitors like Alphabet. Then there is the world of digital health, where Apple would face intense regulations and bureaucracy. Or maybe Apple will try to build glasses that overlay a digital interface on what people see. That technology, called augmented reality, faces enormous technical hurdles — as well as the challenge of getting people to wear a computer on their face. Think of a (hopefully) stylish version of Google’s oft-mocked Google Glass.Whatever he does, Mr. Cook faces enormous expectations. It takes a lot to fuel growth at a company that had $265.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.The Apple Watch dominates the market for wearable technology and would be a smash hit for any other company. For Apple? Watches have been counted in the “other products” category in financial results."

He called President Trump to recommend that the United States temporarily take the company’s best-selling jet out of service, following two deadly crashes in less than five months. Hours later, the president announced that the plane had been grounded.It was a stark reversal for Boeing, an industrial juggernaut that has enjoyed a decade of rapid growth and has deep ties in Washington. Just the day before, the chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, had urged the president to keep the plane flying, as regulators around the world banned the jet.The plane, the 737 Max, was deeply rooted in the company’s psyche, a reflection of its engineering prowess and its enviable safety record. But it was also born out of necessity as the company competed aggressively with its European rival Airbus.The stakes for Boeing are high, with 4,600 pending orders that promise to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars. All that is at risk as regulators and lawmakers begin to investigate what went wrong with the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight and an earlier one on Lion Air. Some carriers are already reconsidering their purchases.ImageListen to ‘The Daily’: Two Crashes, a Single Jet: The Story of Boeing’s 737 MaxThe aerospace giant and its ties to Washington are under scrutiny after a version of its best-selling plane was involved in two deadly accidents in five months.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/24:46-24:46transcriptListen to ‘The Daily’: Two Crashes, a Single Jet: The Story of Boeing’s 737 MaxHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Theo Balcomb and Clare Toeniskoetter, and edited by Paige CowettThe aerospace giant and its ties to Washington are under scrutiny after a version of its best-selling plane was involved in two deadly accidents in five months.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets, it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots. Then, two of those jets crashed. It’s Tuesday, March 19.natalie kitroeffThe global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly. There are two big companies. There’s Boeing, which is American-owned, and there’s Airbus, a European rival.michael barbaroNatalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times.natalie kitroeffThese two are always competing with each other. They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane. And they’re often competing for the same customers.[music]natalie kitroeffSo in late 2010 —archived recordingWe’re not redesigning the A320. It’s pretty damn good just the way it is. What we’re doing is offering new, more fuel-efficient engines on today’s airplane.natalie kitroeff— Airbus announces that it is offering a new, fuel-efficient version of its best-selling A320 plane.archived recordingWell, an A320neo —natalie kitroeffIt’s going to be the A320neo.archived recordingIt’s a new engine option offered on today’s A320 family of aircraft. And now they’re being offered with new, more fuel-efficient engines. We’re putting our money on re-engining the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft.natalie kitroeffThis amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing. Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs. And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money, Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment, where they have one main rival.michael barbaroSo what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel-efficient jetliner?natalie kitroeffBoeing scrambles to respond quickly.archived recording[MUSIC] We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family.natalie kitroeffAnd within months, the company comes up with an upgrade of its own.archived recordingMax efficiency, which leads to profitability, max reliability, and to the flying public, max passenger appeal.natalie kitroeffIt’s going to be a fuel-efficient version of their 737 workhorse. It is going to have bigger engines. And it’s going to save airlines money on this fuel.archived recordingThe best single-aisle airplane in the world. [MUSIC]natalie kitroeffAnd they’re going to call it the 737 Max. And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible.michael barbaroWhy?natalie kitroeffPart of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus. And they’re competing with them on every single cost item. And a plane is not just metal and technology. It’s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it.michael barbaroHm.natalie kitroeffIf the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator, one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane, it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft. It’s incredibly expensive. So if Boeing were to say, we have this beautiful new jet, but it’s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires, the executives might pause on that. So as the company is manufacturing this plane, it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did.michael barbaroSo that there is not a need for training.natalie kitroeffExactly. And there’s a little bit of a problem.[music]natalie kitroeffThere is something that is fundamentally different about this plane. Its engines are bigger, and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings. And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane. So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances. And that can lead to a stall, which is a dangerous situation. So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force. So what it does is it comes up with this system, this software.michael barbaroAnd what does the new system do?natalie kitroeffThe new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose. And it pushes the nose down automatically. And it’s supposed to be working in the background, in a way that pilots don’t even notice, correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane. And it’s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did.michael barbaroSo Boeing thinks even though the engines are different, that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did. And from a pilot’s point of view, therefore, there would be no need for new training?natalie kitroeffYes. Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model. And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed. In March 2017, the F.A.A. certified the plane. It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model. And regulators around the world followed suit. Two months later, Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle. And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists.michael barbaroHmm. So they don’t even tell the pilots. They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don’t even need to know?natalie kitroeffYes.[music]michael barbaroSo what happens next? This plane is certified, on the market. What happens?archived recordingWell, it’s wheels up for Boeing’s new 737 Max.natalie kitroeffOrders come pouring in from across the globe.archived recordingBoeing says the Max 8 is the company’s fastest-selling plane in its history, with nearly 4,700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world.natalie kitroeffAnd carriers make this the best-selling Boeing jet ever.archived recording100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap. That’s a lessor from the Netherlands. Also, Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those.natalie kitroeffPilots love it.archived recordingIt flew beautifully. Its engines were extremely quiet.natalie kitroeffIt is a hit.archived recording 1Still, take a look at shares of Boeing, which —archived recording 2Are up! And up today!natalie kitroeffThey’re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market.archived recording 14Logged orders or commitments for almost 400 aircraft, with a total sticker price of more than $37 billion.natalie kitroeffInvestors love them, customers love them — until October 29, 2018, when Lion Air Flight 610, a 737 Max carrying 189 people, takes off and, 12 minutes later, crashes into the Java Sea.archived recordingThree days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea, there may be hope for answers.michael barbaroWhat do we learn about what went wrong on that flight?archived recordingMilitary personnel have found one of the black boxes.natalie kitroeffSo a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system.archived recordingFlight data shows the on-board computers were pushing the plane’s nose down. Then the pilots aimed the nose higher. That happened 26 times, with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem.natalie kitroeffSo while the software is pushing the nose down, the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again, multiple times. That is the picture that begins to emerge. But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet.michael barbaroSo it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system, a self-correcting one that’s supposed to keep the nose from going up, that they don’t even know exists, right?natalie kitroeffThat’s exactly right. And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading. So it was responding to bad data. And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again, despite the pilot’s best efforts to get the plane back on course.michael barbaroAnd eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system.natalie kitroeffEventually, the plane plunges into the sea, killing all 189 people on board.[music]michael barbaroWhat, Natalie, is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn’t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information, the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash?natalie kitroeffPilots are furious — livid, in fact — that they have not been informed that this thing even exists. So they have these meetings, in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful.michael barbaroSo I have to assume that these angry pilots, in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system, are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system.natalie kitroeffNo, they’re not. The F.A.A., Boeing, nobody is recommending more training on this system.michael barbaroWhy not?natalie kitroeffThe American pilots that I’ve talked to, they believe that because they’ve been informed about the system, now that they know how it works, they are able to safely fly this plane. They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights. And they feel confident about flying the plane. This is a confidence that’s, in part, based on statistics and experience. There has been only one fatality on U.S. airlines in the last decade. Boeing has an enviable safety record. In many ways, they had good reason to be confident. And they’re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down. That’s going to come within the next several weeks. They will be informed of it. And they feel confident that that is enough.michael barbaroO.K., so after this Lion Air crash, the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system. But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere. And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying?natalie kitroeffYes.archived recording 1A jet has crashed, and the tragedy is being felt around the world.archived recording 2U.S. aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight. That’s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today, minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa.archived recording 3Killing everyone on board, Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi, Kenya, when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff. The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members.natalie kitroeffImmediately, it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash.archived recording 1Preliminary data shows a, quote, “clear similarity” to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October.archived recording 2Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts.archived recording 3What we now understand is what people had suspected, that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month.michael barbaroWhat are those similarities?natalie kitroeffSo the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems. So that was a first clue. The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was, up and down. The speeds are changing rapidly, suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system, again, with the pilot trying to pull the nose up, and the system pushing it down. Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down. We don’t know why. But again, it all points to this system being involved, potentially contributing to another tragedy.michael barbaroAnd so what is the reaction this time, after the second crash of a 737 Max?natalie kitroeffBoeing stands firm behind the plane. And American carriers are right there with them. But —archived recordingChina has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet.natalie kitroeff— regulators around the world seem a little less confident. The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max.archived recordingMore countries following China’s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.natalie kitroeffOnce the Europeans follow —archived recordingEuropean Aviation Safety Agency, they have banned flights of the 737 Max series, adding to similar groundings by China, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, the U.K., Singapore, New Zealand, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Turkey. I could go on.natalie kitroeff— American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F.A.A. to ground these planes.archived recording (donald trump)Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully, they’ll very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded.michael barbaroAll of this looks very bad for Boeing, obviously. And it seems to stem from this original motivation, as you described it, to avoid classifying this new energy-efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots, even though a very crucial part of the plane was different.natalie kitroeffThat’s right. This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process. Remember, this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus. It’s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States. There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The F.A.A. and Boeing work together to certify planes. The F.A.A. actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft.michael barbaroAnd is that basically industry practice? Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process?natalie kitroeffThat’s exactly right.michael barbaroHmm.natalie kitroeffI mean, folks were talking about this, right? But nobody was kind of raising red flags. I mean, it wasn’t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works. But now there’s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months. And we’re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy.michael barbaroNatalie, what do we know about the role that Boeing’s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max?natalie kitroeffWe know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft. And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max. The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F.A.A. relying heavily on Boeing in this case, but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes.michael barbaroHmm.natalie kitroeffThe F.A.A., like any federal agency, has a limited budget. And there’s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy. You can see why you would need a relationship, and one where there is a lot of information-sharing, right? Because the one side can’t employ as many people as Boeing does. And the other side has a ton of expertise. But is that relationship too close?michael barbaroRight. And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you’re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co-regulator of itself. And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits. And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust, that balance could get out of whack, and safety might lose out to profits. And the only way we would know that is when there’s a tragedy or two tragedies.natalie kitroeffBoeing doesn’t want planes to crash. So their motivations are, in many ways, exactly aligned with their customers’. But what’s emerged after these two crashes — I mean, you heard the pilots. They said this was a breach of trust.michael barbaroRight.natalie kitroeffI think a lot of people are feeling that right now, that feeling of questioning of this process. And this isn’t to say anything about Boeing’s motivations. We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights, and we do not want to rush to conclusions. But you’re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry, the pilots, the crew, they’re asking that right now. How do we regain trust in Boeing? And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes?michael barbaroWe’ve been talking about trust, the trust that the F.A.A. had in Boeing, that the airlines, their pilots and crews had or didn’t have in this plane. But I’m wondering now about the trust that we, as the flying public, have in these planes. And it’s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon. Let’s say that the software gets fixed. And Boeing and the F.A.A., through their certification process, they all sign off on everything being safe. Why should we trust them after that? Why should we trust them, kind of, ever?natalie kitroeffI think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing, an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before. And you’ll remember, the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013, when it had battery fire problems.michael barbaroAnd that was a Boeing plane?natalie kitroeffRight, a Boeing plane. And we all fly on it. It’s possible that people will be wary right now. But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will. The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country. What, if anything, is going to change in the process by which we determine, in the United States, that planes are safe to fly?[music]michael barbaroNatalie, thank you very much.natalie kitroeffThank you, Michael.One area of focus is whether the training procedures on Boeing’s jet, greenlighted by the Federal Aviation Administration, left pilots unprepared to deal with new software on the plane. When the plane was introduced, Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn’t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed. The F.A.A. didn’t change those rules after the Lion Air crash in October and there are no plans to do so now.Although the investigations are continuing, preliminary evidence and data suggest potential similarities between the crashes, raising questions about the new software on which pilots weren’t trained. Evidence at the Ethiopia crash site suggests there could have been a problem with the software, an automated system designed to help avoid a stall, which has also come up in the Lion Air disaster.When Airbus announced in 2010 that it would introduce a new fuel-efficient and cost-effective plane, Boeing rushed to get out its own version. The strategy depended heavily on building a plane that worked essentially the same as the previous generation. Regulators agreed that it was a derivative model and that it didn’t require additional simulator training, a significant savings for airlines.ImageJim Albaugh and Nicole Piasecki, Boeing executives at the time, talking to reporters in 2011 about plans for the Max. Today, there is only one simulator specifically designed for the Max in the United States.CreditStephen Brashear/Associated PressFor many new airplane models, pilots train for hours on giant, multimillion-dollar machines, on-the-ground versions of cockpits that mimic the flying experience and teach them new features. But in the case of the Max, many pilots with 737 experience learned about the plane on an iPad.“We would have liked to have had a simulator” from the start, said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. “But it wasn’t practical, because it wasn’t built yet.”As Boeing pushed to get the plane done, flights simulators designed specifically for the Max weren’t ready. Greg Bowen, the training and standards chair at the Southwest pilots association, said that senior leadership at the carrier told him the engineering data necessary to design simulator software was still being finalized right up until the plane was nearly completed.“They were building the airplane and still designing it,” Mr. Bowen said. “The data to build a simulator didn’t become available until about when the plane was ready to fly.”When United was set to take delivery of the 737 Max in 2017, a group of pilots put together training materials without ever flying the aircraft or a full simulator. James LaRosa, a 737 captain and union official who helped lead the training group, said he flew to a Boeing training center in Seattle to learn about the new plane on a mock cockpit that didn’t move like typical simulators.In addition to a two-hour iPad training course from Boeing, he and colleagues used their experience in the cockpit to create a 13-page handbook on the differences between the Max and its predecessor, including changes to displays and the engines. The training materials did not mention the new software that later became a focus of the Lion Air crash investigation.ImageIndonesian rescue personnel recovering the wreckage of an engine from the Lion Air flight.CreditUlet Ifansasti/Getty ImagesImageIndonesian emergency workers after the crash of a 737 Max 8 last year.CreditUlet Ifansasti/Getty Images“When you find out that there are systems on it that are wildly different that affect the performance of the aircraft, having a simulator is part of a safety culture,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot. “It can be the difference between a safe, recoverable flight and one that makes the newspapers.”Boeing said in a statement that “the 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F.A.A. requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.”“The F.A.A.’s aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,” the regulator said in a statement.After the Lion Air crash that killed all 189 people aboard, the new software on the plane became an area of focus for investigators and pilots.The new engines on the planes were bigger, part of Boeing’s competitive push to make it more fuel efficient. To compensate for the different aerodynamics that were the result of the larger engines, Boeing installed a system, known as MCAS, that automatically pushes the plane’s nose down in certain circumstances. A central concern in the Lion Air disaster is that the system may have malfunctioned, based on faulty sensor readings.After the crash, it was clear that pilots of the 737 Max had not been fully informed about the new software. Shortly after Thanksgiving, pilot unions from Southwest and American met separately with Boeing officials. The unions wanted answers.“The first thing we talked about was the break of trust,” said Mr. Tajer, the American pilot union spokesman. “We called it disrespectful.”According to Mr. Tajer, Boeing officials told American’s pilots that they hadn’t mentioned the new software because they didn’t want to “inundate” them with information.The union told Boeing that it was now demanding simulators for its pilots. “We don’t really care what the F.A.A. requires,” Mr. Tajer said, recalling the meeting.Pilots at American Airlines, who began asking for simulators for the new model as soon as they started flying the planes, ramped up their requests after the Lion Air crash.ImageFlowers left at the site in Ethiopia where a Max 8 crashed last weekend. Pilots in the United States have expressed frustration that they weren’t told earlier about a new automated system on the plane.CreditMulugeta Ayene/Associated PressBoeing officials promised American and Southwest pilots a software fix within several weeks, but added that extra training was not necessary. Notifying the pilots of the nature of the software fix and how it would function would be enough.The airlines agreed. After those meetings, the pilots from both unions said that they were certain that they could keep flying the plane safely, even without simulators. Once they had been told how the new software worked, they believed they had “all the information on the system and the ability to interrupt it if it went afoul,” said Mr. Tajer.Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House transportation committee, said he asked F.A.A. officials after the Lion Air crash why more substantial training was not required.“I said, ‘This is essentially a different airplane, and how is it that it was certified without requiring pilot retraining?’” Mr. DeFazio recalled. He said the F.A.A. defended what had been decided as the work of pilots and others who “came to a consensus decision.”ImageA Max 9 being built in Renton, Wash., two years ago. Boeing has halted deliveries of new Max planes.CreditJason Redmond/ReutersThe F.A.A. bases its rules for training around the typical experience of a pilot in the United States, explaining that “the average caliber, skill and training of U.S. pilots is extensive, with countless hours of flight time and training both on the flight deck and in simulators.” But other countries tend to follow the lead of the United States in terms of training, leaving less experienced pilots potentially vulnerable.“Overseas, pilots in some cases have a tiny fraction of the training that our pilots have,” Mr. DeFazio said. “Our pilots may all be good enough to recover with an MCAS problem with a bad sensor.”After the Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people, Boeing made calls to airlines, reassuring them that it was taking the situation seriously. Still, it said, it had full faith in the plane.“We are confident in the safety of the 737 Max,” Mr. Muilenburg wrote in an email to employees on Monday, “and in the work of the men and women who design and build it.”The tragedy consumed Mr. Trump, according to a person familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. He talked about it repeatedly and brought up other major aviation disasters, including the 2015 Germanwings crash, which left 150 dead after the pilot deliberately slammed into the French Alps.After his first call with Mr. Muilenburg, Mr. Trump was leaning against banning the flights, according to the person. But aides urged the president to intervene, telling him that the United States couldn’t be the only country to allow the planes to keep flying.Instead of letting the F.A.A. announce the grounding, Mr. Trump blurted it out during an event about drug trafficking. “The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,” he said. He added of Boeing, “They are working very, very hard right now and hopefully they’ll very quickly come up with the answer, but until they do, the planes are grounded.”It is unclear when the planes will start flying again. The company is expected to roll out a software fix by April, which will modify features of the jet around the automated system.But Boeing isn’t planning to overhaul its training procedures. And neither the F.A.A., nor the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, are proposing additional simulator training for pilots, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Instead, the regulators and Boeing agree that the best way to inform pilots about the new software is through additional computer-based training, which can be done on their personal computers.While many pilots in the United States are still committed to the plane, they are pushing for Boeing to be more proactive.ImageA Max 8 landing at Tulsa International Airport in Oklahoma. American, Southwest and United are the three airlines in the United States with Max planes in their fleets.CreditNick Oxford for The New York Times“Would I go out and fly one today and put my family on it? Yeah, I would. Because I know how to fly it,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 captain. “But I would like to see the fix done and have a full briefing from the manufacturer about what this thing is really going to do and how it’s going to do it.”And airlines are getting flight simulators, even if they aren’t required by regulators. One flight simulator maker has received 40 orders.It will be months before pilots in the United States can use them.Hours after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, Mr. Tajer, the American Airlines union spokesman, spoke with the carrier and asked for an update on the simulator request. The reply: One had been ordered, and pilots would be able to train on it by the end of this year.United Airlines, the world’s third-largest carrier, was told that it has to wait until 2020 for one. Today, there is only one simulator specifically designed for the Max in the United States."
5c54bbf03a125f5075c07a18,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/media/marvelous-mrs-maisel-amazon-ratings.html,"PASADENA, Calif. — Amazon Prime’s original series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has received warm reviews and scored big at the Emmys and the Golden Globes.But, as with most streaming shows, no one knows how broadly popular it is.Now there is some semblance of an answer: fairly popular, at least by the standards of cable television comedies. Also, most of its viewers live on the coasts.The insights come courtesy of Nielsen, the 96-year-old company that has only recently started tracking streaming viewership. This is the first time it has released numbers for an Amazon series.The second season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” averaged 1.9 million viewers during its first seven days on the service, according to Nielsen. The first episode had an average audience of 3.3 million viewers over that week, Nielsen said.Those numbers suggest the show would perform well among the more popular comedies on cable. The FX critical darling “Atlanta” averaged 1.5 million viewers over seven days for its most recent season, while “The Last O.G.,” the TBS series starring Tracy Morgan, had two million. (Both series have many more viewers on average when digital viewing is factored in.) There are many cable dramas that have a much bigger audience.Nielsen has spent the last few years trying to find a method to measure viewership for streaming services. The step is a critical one for the research company, which is facing something of an existential threat as people increasingly abandon the bread-and-butter viewership habits that Nielsen has long tracked.Over the last 15 months, Nielsen has publicly released occasional viewership statistics for Netflix series. It also releases more extensive numbers to media companies that pay for the service.There are several caveats to Nielsen’s streaming numbers. It measures only in the United States, and it uses audio recognition software to discern if a Nielsen household is watching a series. The service does not track out-of-home viewing that might be done on a laptop, a phone or an iPad.Amazon said last year that it had more than 100 million global subscribers.Netflix has rejected Nielsen’s numbers in the past. Amazon declined to comment for this article.In a statement, Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen’s senior vice president of product leadership, said the company released streaming figures that “might be engaging and topical for a broader audience.”But the disclosure has come when Netflix is finally starting to disclose some statistics on its own. It declared two new shows, “You” and “Sex Education,” “huge hits,” saying each was on track to be sampled by 40 million households within four weeks of becoming available. Several television executives privately groused that those numbers were meaningless.Many television executives are hopeful that a reliable third-party tracking service will eventually become available. Nielsen is trying to prove it is in the pole position.According to Nielsen, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” was more popular than the final season of Netflix’s “House of Cards,” which debuted in November. That had an average of 1.5 million viewers over its first seven days, with the season premiere watched by 2.9 million.“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a 1950s New York housewife turned comedian, is particularly popular among wealthier viewers, Nielsen said. The median income of a household watching the series is $95,000 — higher than for any other streaming show for which Nielsen has released statistics, including “The Crown,” “13 Reasons Why” and “Stranger Things.”Nielsen also said “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” was overwhelmingly popular on the coasts, with 51 percent of its viewers in the Northeast and in Pacific territories.Nielsen has not yet released figures for other stand-alone services like Hulu, which streams “The Handmaid’s Tale,” or CBS All Access, which has “The Good Fight.”"
5caf3aae49f0eacbf1f82c56,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/theater/playboy-club-playboy-live.html,"“Let’s be outrageous,” Brandon James Gwinn murmured into a microphone. “Let’s misbehave.”It was Monday night at the Playboy Club and everyone seemed to be behaving relatively well. People chatted, checked their phones, ate prawns served pink and prone on a bed of crushed ice, like sunbathers stranded atop some glacier. Besides, when a culture is grappling, however clumsily, with questions of sexual equality and power differentials, what would misbehavior look like anyway?Five of the Playboy Bunnies lined up, a fluffy-tailed choo-choo train, and demonstrated the bunny hop as the band played along. Everyone was invited to join in. Max Chernin, one of the evening’s guest performers, grabbed the nearest waist and gamely hop hop hopped. Would a conga line form? No. Mr. Chernin sat back down.This new iteration of the Playboy Club — New York’s original branch closed in 1986 — opened in September, just west of the theater district. With its velvet banquettes, black walls and Sputnik chandeliers it resembles a midcentury bordello. Every Monday since March 25 it has been hosting Playboy Live!, a showcase for Broadway talent that joins other off-night hotspots like Feinstein’s/54 Below, Birdland and, more recently, the Green Room 42 at the Times Square Yotel. Tuesdays are for backgammon.ImageA wall inside the Playboy Club in Midtown Manhattan.CreditJackie Molloy for The New York TimesDuring the first set, in the dining room, Mr. Gwinn and the T-Shirt Tuxedo Trio, with Anne Fraser Thomas on vocals, purred jazz standards and a few torch songs, plus a bossa nova version of “I Could Have Danced All Night,” scrolling through the set list on an iPad. As Beau Speer, the evening’s producer, told me, the acoustics in that room don’t really favor belting. Then the band took a break, reforming a half-hour later in the lounge and leading off with “Man of La Mancha.”Generally and with a lot of exceptions, Broadway appeals to women and families, a demographic that wouldn’t seem to overlap with the Playboy brand. The magazine’s old cover line made it explicit: Entertainment for Men. A few days earlier I’d asked Nicole Levinson, the vice president of brand management and partnerships, if Playboy’s founder, Hugh Hefner, had been a show-tune enthusiast. “He was not himself a Broadway fan,” she said diplomatically. “He definitely supported performance.”As Diana Garcia, who was recently hired to program the club, said, “We want people to realize that it’s not about just these men in suits coming in having business meetings. It is about female empowerment.” Is that why Ms. Thomas and Tracy McDowell would later cover “Take Me or Leave Me” from “Rent”?The funny, awful, sorry-grateful thing about Playboy Live! is that it didn’t seem to be about anything or for anybody — not the couples on dates or the tables of all women or the coed friend groups or the child who was carried out of the dining room in mid-tantrum. (Apparently, you can bring a child to this Playboy Club. Should you? Depends how your child feels about arty bikini photos and olive fed Wagyu nigiri.) Is this the misbehavior Mr. Gwinn suggested?At dinner, no one applauded the trio, except for the other performers perched down front. One of them, Jen Sanchez, delivered an insinuating version of “I’ve Got You Under My Skin,” which sounded at least a little dirty.ImageRebranding effort: The new club offers show tunes on Mondays and backgammon on Tuesdays. Patrons can bunny hop whenever the mood strikes.CreditJackie Molloy for The New York TimesIn the lounge, a few more tables leaned in. But most guests busied themselves taking selfies or talking to the Bunnies. Relentlessly pleasant, each Bunny wore a custom-tailored corset, bow-tie and heels. Though mostly decorative, a few set down drinks with the patented Bunny dip. Some were tall and some were short. Diversity.When a birthday was announced, five Bunnies lit sparklers and sang in almost harmony, making the club feel like a pheromone-spiked Señor Frog’s and maybe creating a fire hazard.In their earlier iteration, the Playboy Clubs were created by and for men, places where little and medium shots could feel like big ones and women could imply sex without having to deliver it. Now women can be members. Ms. Garcia told me that the club wants to welcome the L.G.B.T.Q. community, too. A newer magazine cover line reads: Entertainment for All. So if it isn’t selling men sex, what is Playboy selling? Probably not Ms. McDowell’s bouncy Barry Manilow cover.The brand has struggled with this for a while. In 2011, “The Playboy Club,” a Hefner-approved drama trading on nostalgia, lasted only three episodes. In 2015, the magazine announced that it would no longer include nude pictures. In 2017, just before Hefner died, nudity came back. The Playboy Club seems part of an obvious effort to rebrand — Ms. Levinson prefers language like “evolve” — Playboy into a more generic luxury property that honors its history but makes its cotton-tailed frisson available to all. (Although if you want to visit the Rabbit Hole, the speakeasy two floors below, you’ll need to pay at least $25,000 in annual membership fees.) Its current vision of empowerment still involves lacing women into those corsets and having them bunny hop — smiling, jiggling — a narrow definition of liberation. If the Playboy Club has an orientation, it is retrosexual.Late in the evening, the band struck up the bunny hop again and the Bunnies formed ranks. No one joined the dance."
5c88e31449f0eacbf105ccdd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/personaltech/online-music-lessons-apps.html,"You’re never too old to learn to play a musical instrument, but finding a tutor and the time for lessons is another matter. If working with a personal teacher isn’t an option for you — or your interest in noodling around on a guitar, a piano or another instrument is still at the casual level — turn to your laptop or mobile device to learn the basics in your own time and space. Here are a few ways to get started. Step 1: Find Your HardwareObviously, you’ll need an instrument to play. If you’re not ready to commit the cash to buy, check your local listings for rental options. Music Rental Central is one national site that leases a wide variety of band and orchestra instruments; prices depend on what you’re playing, but a starter violin rents for less than $16 a month.Buying a used instrument can save you money over a new one, but check the return policy. If you can, try the used instrument before you buy it to make sure the sound and feel suit you. In addition to eBay and Craigslist, you can search and buy used gear on Reverb.ImageMusical instruments for sale and advice for buying them are plentiful on the web. Musician’s Friend is one site that has both in one place.Should nothing but new do for you, fresh gear is only a web search away. If you want detailed buying advice, check out the Musician’s Friend site, which has a Beginner’s Store area.Step 2: Explore Music Instruction AppsIf you want the flexibility to take your music lessons anywhere, your app store has plenty of options. Most have a free lesson and then charge a subscription, although old-school Windows and Mac software like eMedia Music’s instrument training programs are complete by download or disc for about $60.ImageThe SimplyPiano app uses easy-to-follow instructions on the screen and works with any piano or keyboard.CreditThe New York TimesFor keyboard instruction on a mobile device, Simply Piano (for Android and iOS) takes a student from finding middle C to playing along with onscreen guides and gamelike animations. The program is free with in-app purchases, and you can start the lessons with an onscreen keyboard. Eventually, though, you’ll need to get your own external keyboard; the software provides performance feedback by listening to you play.Yousician (for Android, iOS, Windows and MacOS) uses videos, animations and performance feedback to teach guitar, bass, piano, ukulele or voice; monthly plans start at $20 a month; cheaper annual plans are also available. Fender Play for Android and iOS ($10 a month) has similar instructional videos with “bite-size” lessons for learning guitar, bass or ukulele. And, in addition to apps for specific instruments, you can find instruction for specialty styles — like Tunefox for bluegrass.ImageSome apps focus on a particular style of music and the instruments used for it. For example, Tunefox for iOS and the web offers lessons for banjo, guitar, bass or mandolin.CreditThe New York TimesStep 3: Get Free or Inexpensive Video Lessons OnlineIf you don’t want to invest in an app and just want to learn a specific song or technique, a quick search of YouTube or Vimeo can reel in homemade video lessons made by players sharing their knowledge.You can get more structured video lessons from the pros on the ArtistWorks site. For as little as $24 a month, for example, you can learn French horn from William Caballero of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra or mandolin from Mike Marshall, a longtime recording artist.ImageApple’s GarageBand for Mac includes free video instruction for guitar and piano.CreditThe New York TimesGot a Mac? Apple’s free GarageBand software is another outlet for guitar and piano lessons through video and onscreen graphics, and you can download lessons from within the program. (The lessons are not available in the iOS version.)Step 4: Take Live Lessons With Real PeopleIf you learn better with immediate feedback from a human teacher — but don’t have one in your area — you can get video-chat lessons with a qualified instructor on the other side of the webcam. Sites like Lessonface, LiveMusicTutor, Musika and TakeLessons let you search by instrument or browse the instructors. Prices vary, and some teachers offer a free sample lesson.ImageLessonface is one of the many sites where you can browse for a live teacher and get instruction over a webcam.Step 5: Study FurtherMost recorded instruction demonstrates how to play the instrument through video or animation. You may also get chord diagrams or tablature (notation that shows where your fingers go on the strings) as a reference. But if you want to study music theory, train your ear or learn how to read music, search for an appropriate app.EarMaster (for Windows, Mac and iPad; prices vary) is one option. You can also dive into a theory class or study an instrument on LinkedIn Learning for $25 to $30 a month. Among others online, the Open University site has a free introductory music-theory course.ImageEarMaster for iPad, Windows and Mac is one of several programs that teach ear training and music theory.Once you have found the app, site or online teacher that works best with your life, you just need to do one more thing: Fire up that calendar app and schedule time to practice, practice, practice."
5c838f0349f0eacbf105c30b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/travel/hotel-review-the-ramble-hotel-denver.html,"RatesFrom $249The BasicsTo get to the front desk of the 50-room Ramble Hotel, which opened in Denver’s River North Art District (RiNo) last May, guests walk through what amounts to a cocktail jamboree: the first outpost of the bar Death & Co beyond New York City’s East Village. The hotel, owned by Ryan Diggins, 34, a local developer, was generally inspired by the salons of 17th-century France, and, specifically, by Catherine de Vivonne, Marquise de Rambouillet, whose own salon was known as an egalitarian gathering. “I loved what the French salon stood for, as really it was a place for everyone, as long as you had an opinion,” Mr. Diggins said. “Ramble is our shortened version of her name, and also means to wander or explore without a definitive destination.” In hopes of fostering the Marquise’s ideal of interaction and engagement, the hotel stocked the airy, ground-floor lobby with myriad seating areas for lingering, and also holds occasional art programs in its adjacent event space. The LocationThe hotel is close to RiNo’s inventive restaurants (Comal Heritage Food Incubator, where Syrian refugees make the best hummus I’ve tasted, based on their own recipes), shops (like Modern Nomad, a housewares store in a former auto body shop) and food halls (including Zeppelin Station, which opened last March). Our room faced Larimer Street, which was once a hangout for the Beat muse Neal Cassady, and can be rowdy; we listened to bachelorette parties swish by like whirligigs on 16-passenger bike bar tours. The Denver Rescue Mission nearby means revelers may be sobered by denizens down on their luck.ImageThe Ramble has designed its airy lobby to have plenty of spots for guests to linger and talk.CreditJoshua PerezThe RoomDecorated by Avenue Interior Design of Los Angeles, our 300-square-foot standard king guest room — overlooking Denver’s circa 1933 Benjamin Moore factory neon sign — was a victim of latter day design clichés: a sliding barn door to the bathroom, a button-tufted ottoman, a treacly framed compass. The minibar was a bit of a misnomer, as it held 375 milliliter bottles — nearly a pint — of liquor, which seemed excessive for the average traveler and not carry-on approved by the T.S.A.; options included Tito’s vodka ($20) and Basil Hayden’s bourbon ($28). Still, I loved the soft antique Persian rug on the hickory flooring, the Prussian blue walls, the scroll arm chairs in the window-front sitting area, and the Victrola Bluetooth gramophone speaker. There was a French press with fresh grounds from the Denver roaster Middle State Coffee.The BathroomMy inner Dolly Parton appreciated that the 64-square-foot bathroom included a glam station: a Hollywood vanity mirror surrounded by 15 frosted light bulbs. But as someone who is also a nonagenarian on the inside, I must point out that the sleek glass shower enclosure, with brass Waterworks fixtures, left a puddle of water on the porcelain tile floor. There was no bathtub, which I wasn’t missing in this often drought-parched state. The rosemary mint toiletries, custom blended for the hotel, smelled absolutely delicious.The AmenitiesBeyond valet parking and a 200-square-foot cardio room fitted with a Precor elliptical, free weights and two treadmills, there were very few extracurricular amenities at the Ramble. I can only assume that some guests were there to carouse. Wi-Fi is free and fast, and you can stream your Netflix and other accounts to the TV. The hotel recently installed iPads in every room for communicating with staff, which was wise — the rooms don’t have phones, and my own iPhone had no service in the room.ImageThe Ramble Hotel opened in Denver last May, with an outpost of Death & Co in the lobbyCreditJoshua PerezDiningAfter I booked the room, a confirmation email from the hotel urged me to make a reservation at Death & Co posthaste. The scene-y herringbone-floored, chandelier-lit lobby bar warranted the precaution. I ordered the Mondrian cocktail — with blanco tequila, raspberry, aperitivo, egg white and sparkling wine — which tasted like a melted Popsicle, and, given the late afternoon hour and my near heat exhaustion, I actually liked. We had dinner at Super Mega Bien, the on-site Latin American dim sum restaurant by Dana Rodriguez, a James Beard Award-nominated chef. Exquisite dishes included chipotle honey-roasted duck served with stout housemade flour gorditas and goat cheese stuffed fried squash blossoms. The Bottom LineAlthough families with children might want to book elsewhere, the Ramble Hotel is a perfect den for those hoping to experience a sliver of Denver’s 19th-century reputation as the party-opolis of the Wild West.The Ramble Hotel, 1280 25th Street; 720-996-6300; theramblehotel.comFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Salon 94 Bowery, 243 Bowery, Manhattan; 212-979-0001, salon94.com.The Pintupi artist Yukultji Napangati lives and works in Western Australia’s Gibson Desert, and you can see it in her paintings. Each of the 10 untitled canvases in her first solo show at Salon 94 is covered with a dense network of wavy lines reminiscent of topographical maps. Alternating at first between a deep, earthy red and a brown that’s almost black, Ms. Napangati painstakingly covers the red stripes with tiny, overlapping dots that range from pale, sandy yellow to bright orange. Often she alternates the color of the dots, too, using lighter and darker shades in groups of five or six to create patterns that could pass for grassy plains or for those same grassy plains on fire. The close-set lines even produce an optical glare very much like a desert mirage.That said, what really evokes the earth in Ms. Napangati’s paintings is the relentless way she applies her ancient colors and motifs. Unlike in a figurative painting with its foreground, background and empty spaces, or even an Op Art design that glides confidently across its gessoed surface like a figure skater on ice, every one of Ms. Napangati’s marks seems equally hard won. It’s as if they are creating their own ground as they move across the canvas, and any pause would leave artist and viewer alike falling into the abyss. WILL HEINRICHErik van LieshoutThrough March 9. Anton Kern, 16 East 55th Street, Manhattan; 212-367-9663, antonkerngallery.com.ImageInstallation view of Erik van Lieshout’s show “BEER.” Its centerpiece is a film that covers a lot of ground in 36 minutes.CreditThomas MuellerLast year Erik van Lieshout won the Dr. A.H. Heineken Prize for Art, which is given to midcareer Dutch artists and comes with an award of 100,000 euros (about $114,000). Shortly thereafter, everything headed south. But like any prize-worthy artist, he managed to pull himself together, finding inspiration in his ordeal. The resulting work is now on view  at Anton Kern.The centerpiece of the show is “BEER” (2019), a  film that covers a lot of ground in 36 minutes. There are scandals involving female prostitutes promoting Heineken beer in African countries, and a Heineken executive’s supposed affair with one of the women; Mr. van Lieshout’s negative comments about Heineken that went viral; ruminations on colonialism, gentrification, failure and aging; and Mr. van Lieshout discussing his plans to build a pharmacy in Tanzania with some of the prize money. The show is, naturally, awash in beer (in the video, Mr. van Lieshout dons goggles and dunks his head in a vat of beer), despite the fact that he has been sober for nearly a decade.Screened in a rickety cardboard theater painted bright Heineken-green, the show’s packing-tape aesthetic mirrors the work of Thomas Hirschhorn, another artist-provocateur. References to other similar figures abound: Joseph Beuys, Martin Kippenberger, Jan Dibbets and Marcel Duchamp. Rippling below these allusions is the question: Can artists still be social critics, tricksters and renegades when they’re accepting corporate money? And beneath that is another, more universal question: Is this the twilight of idols, the last gasp of Great White Men dominating art and life? (“I turn life into art,” Mr. van Lieshout says in the film, “except mine is not lofty.”)The exhibition, which also includes paintings and drawings, hints at a global changing of the guard. Although the film’s denouement, which includes footage of Mr. van Lieshout agreeably accepting the Heineken Prize, argues otherwise. MARTHA SCHWENDENER‘The World According to’Through March 23. Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan; 212-421-3292, pacegallery.com.ImageKatherine Bradford’s “Boxers Under Lights” (2018), in the show “The World According to . . .” at Pace Gallery.CreditKatherine Bradford, via Pace Gallery; Rich Lee I’ve never loved David Hockney’s embrace of new technology. His iPad drawings mostly strike me as a waste of ingenuity. But there’s something irresistibly charming about his 2011 work “Seven Yorkshire Landscapes,” a super-crisp, multichannel digital video that anchors “The World According to …,” curated by Andria Hickey at Pace Gallery. For nearly 13 minutes, lush greenery moves slowly across 18 tiled screens. Each landscape is doubled, appearing from a slightly different angle on either half of the video bay, but the invocation of stereoscopic vision is very loose: Cars flash by but cross only one side, and the picture doesn’t quite line up from screen to screen, especially when one of them holds a momentary close-up of a single, dewy leaf. Altogether it’s a brilliant way to capture not the look, but the feel of a bracing walk in the country.Surrounding and amply supporting this video are paintings and sculptures by a dozen other artists, many of which develop a similarly faceted beauty in rich but soft-spoken colors. The standouts include two crimson-and-purple-toned paintings by Katherine Bradford, “Brothers” and “Boxers Under Lights,” in which flat male figures are crossed and stacked like I-beams, and Celeste Dupuy-Spencer’s “Anastasis of the Wild,” in which a gorgeous multicolored wolf trots alongside its own incarnate shadow.

5c55fcc53a125f5075c07bbb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html,"The average person would have to spend 76 working days reading all of the digital privacy policies they agree to in the span of a year. Reading Amazon’s terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately nine hours.Why would anyone read the terms of service when they don’t feel as though they have a choice in the first place? It’s not as though a user can call up Mark Zuckerberg and negotiate his or her own privacy policy. The “I agree” button should have long ago been renamed “Meh, whatever.” The legal fiction of consent is blatant in the privacy scandal du jour. Both Google and Facebook have been paying people — including minors as young as 13 — to download an app that tracks nearly all their phone activity and usage habits.Facebook advertised their app on services beloved by teens, like Snapchat and Instagram, seeking participants between the ages of 13 and 35. The sign-up process required minors to get parental consent. (How rigorous? Users simply had to scroll down and click on a check box.) In exchange for participating in what Facebook called a research project, each user received $20 a month, plus referral bonuses. Similarly, Google’s Screenwise Meter app harvested user information in exchange for money. Google was a little more careful than Facebook, barring minors unless they were participating as part of a larger household.It’s unlikely these children understood what they gave up by agreeing to use the app. And even if they’d received proper parental consent, their parents may not have understood what they were giving away on their child’s behalf. But it wasn’t the predatory nature of these programs that prompted Apple to disable them on iPhones and iPads. Rather, Apple objected to how Google and Facebook had used a loophole to transmit customer data without having to go through Apple first. In other words, it looks as though two tech giants and their armies of lawyers didn’t read the policy closely enough and violated Apple’s terms and conditions.People are often startled by what they wind up giving away by clicking on the “yes” button. They are shocked to find when they connect their Spotify and Netflix accounts to their Facebook account that those streaming services gain access to their Facebook messages. They are confused and outraged by Facebook’s uncanny ability to recommend “friends” that the company shouldn’t really know about — say, a social worker’s client, a sperm donor’s biological child, a woman’s father’s mistress. Data is powerful and can inform on us in unexpected ways. Companies learn all about you, but also all about your friends who haven’t signed up for these services. Consumers’ confusion about this gives rise to conspiracy theories that phone microphones are secretly snooping on users. According to academics who have done the research, that’s probably just paranoia. The likely truth is that all the other data you give away is enough to predict what you have said and will say in conversations.Countless devices and internet services now pervade daily life. We don’t need to live in a world governed by their terms and conditions, propped up by the legal fiction of consent. If empowered and properly funded, the Federal Trade Commission can become the privacy watchdog that this era so desperately needs. And the repeal or modification of the Federal Arbitration Act can defang the very worst provision that so frequently pops up in terms and conditions — the surrender of the right to sue a company in court.Legislation can mandate transparency about who has your data and can give users the right to stop it from being sold. New laws can lay down basic guarantees of privacy that won't require you to wade through hundreds of thousands of words of legalese. Europe is already leading the way with the General Data Protection Regulation. California has followed that example by passing a law with similar protections, scheduled to go into effect in 2020. Americans deserve strong privacy protections. Consent is not enough to replace them. The clicks that pass for consent are uninformed, non-negotiated and offered in exchange for services that are often necessary for civic life.

5c5e0e6e3a125f5075c08cf6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/les-moonves-moonrise.html,"Just months after being fired by CBS, Leslie Moonves is running a new company.And though Mr. Moonves and his former employer are locked in a dispute over $120 million in severance, CBS is paying for the office space that Mr. Moonves now occupies.The company, Moon Rise Unlimited, operates out of a 10th-floor suite at 9000 Sunset Boulevard, among the tallest buildings in West Hollywood. A glass-sheathed office tower with expansive views of Los Angeles, it can be seen from miles away and is near entertainment industry beehives like Soho House and Chateau Marmont.Mr. Moonves was forced out of CBS in September after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. In December, the company officially said he was fired, citing “willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract.”His exit agreement, however, states that CBS must pay for Mr. Moonves’s “office services” for no less than a year, even if the company fired him for cause. CBS declined to comment.On Oct. 30, according to a filing with the California secretary of state, Mr. Moonves registered Moon Rise Unlimited, a limited liability company that will focus on “entertainment services.” He is listed as the company’s manager in a separate filing.Mr. Moonves also appears to have formed two related companies around the same time: Moon Rise Technologies, which it said in a filing planned to provide “streaming services and distribution,” and Moon Rise Productions, which it said planned to provide “film and television production” services.Mr. Moonves’s specific ambitions are not clear. Moon Rise Unlimited has no website, has no track record in Hollywood and has made no efforts to promote itself when it was incorporated. A spokesman for Mr. Moonves confirmed that he had an office in the building, but declined further comment.Mr. Moonves has denied all the misconduct allegations and said any sexual acts he engaged in were consensual.Mr. Moonves, who for years enjoyed the attention and privileges befitting one of the most powerful men in media, has maintained a public profile since his ouster.He was spotted lounging on David Geffen’s yacht in St. Bart’s, was seen dining at Hollywood restaurants like Craig’s and Sunset Tower and had a run-in with the comedian Kathy Griffin at the Beverly Hills Hotel’s Polo Lounge, according to published reports.At the same time, Mr. Moonves and his legal team are gearing up to fight CBS in arbitration for his severance. The network said it would refuse to pay him after determining that he failed to comply with an internal company investigation into his behavior, and even misled investigators. Under the terms of his exit agreement, CBS had been paying Mr. Moonves’s legal fees. The company is not paying his legal fees for the arbitration. Should Mr. Moonves prevail, CBS would have to pay those bills.For more than three decades, Mr. Moonves had an outsize role in shaping the network television landscape. Before he joined CBS, he was a producer with hits like “Full House” in the 1980s and “ER” and “Friends” in the 1990s. At CBS, he turned a last-place network into the most-watched channel on television.Then last year, a dozen women told The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow that Mr. Moonves had sexually harassed or assaulted them. As CBS looked into those claims, it also learned that Mr. Moonves was trying to buy the silence of another accuser by getting her work on a CBS show.Mr. Moonves had told the company’s outside lawyers that an unnamed actress had accused him of sexually assaulting her more than two decades earlier. But he did not share that the actress’s manager, Marv Dauer, had pushed him to get her an acting role.Mr. Moonves deleted many of his texts with Mr. Dauer, and gave investigators his son’s iPad instead of his own, according to a draft of the investigators’ report that was reviewed by The New York Times.As part of his employment agreement, Mr. Moonves was required to comply with any internal investigation. Investigators advised CBS that it would be on strong footing to fire Mr. Moonves for cause, according to the report — a move that would allow the network to avoid paying him the $120 million exit package.The building housing Moon Rise’s office is situated along a particularly gridlocked stretch of the Sunset Strip. A Wells Fargo branch occupies the first floor and the west side of the building is covered by an ad for the HBO series “2 Dope Queens.” To the immediate east is one of Larry Flynt’s Hustler lingerie and adult toy boutiques.On a clear day, the 10th floor would afford views out over West Hollywood and Beverly Hills and on to the Pacific Ocean.There is no directory in the lobby.“We don’t have a directory because our tenants don’t want people to know they are here,” a security guard on duty said."
5c6e76fd3a125f5075c0ac1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/well/whats-covered-under-medicare-a-new-app-may-leave-you-still-wondering.html,"Millennials, beware: Your grandparents are about to start calling you for help downloading the new Medicare smartphone app.The iPhone and Android app, which launched Feb. 6, is called “What’s Covered,” and true to its name, it mostly answers one simple, yes-or-no question: Is this medical procedure covered by traditional Medicare?Milt Roney, a 71-year-old retired government worker in a well-to-do suburb of Washington, D.C., agreed to check out the app with me, though he was skeptical from the outset.“I wouldn’t use an app like that,” Roney said. “[My procedures are] going to be covered, and I’m not going to worry about it.”Still, the app, available free from the Google Play and Apple App stores, is part of a broader Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ initiative, called eMedicare, to put more tools and information about Medicare online. (CMS declined a request for an interview.)But much like the medicare.gov website, it doesn’t delve into individual beneficiaries’ specifics. It doesn’t ask what other coverage he or she might have, so it can’t take into account supplementary insurance, deductibles, coinsurance or other factors that determine cost.“While usable and good for general information, it doesn’t provide personalized information that might be more helpful in making treatment or access decisions,” said Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit organization.Milt’s wife, Lisa Roney, 70, joined him to participate in my own “expert panel,” to download the app and try it out.It’s worth noting that these experts were my backup plan. The first couple I approached told me that they’d love to help, but they had “dumb phones” and wouldn’t be able to download anything.This highlights perhaps a more fundamental problem. Many people of Medicare age don’t have a smartphone, and aren’t familiar with apps or comfortable manipulating screens.According to a report from AARP, 46 percent of people in their 60s do not have smartphones. Only 29 percent of the 70-and-older crowd do. The report suggests that the trend will tick upward, with more older Americans owning mobile technology each year.The Roneys both have Medicare Part A and B, which covers hospitalizations and doctor visits. They both have smartphones. As retired government workers, they also both have insurance from GEHA, the Government Employees Health Association, which covers their dental care, prescription drugs and some other expenses. Milt Roney gets some money from GEHA to hand out brochures at health fairs.They consider themselves pretty tech-savvy. They have iPads, personal computers and iPhones. Lisa Roney wears a Fitbit.But they immediately questioned the necessity of the app.“I’d just pick up the phone and call if I had a question about what was covered,” Milt Roney said.“I’d probably just look it up in the [Medicare] book,” Lisa Roney said, pulling the 2-inch manual from a drawer in her office.Then came the first hurdle: downloading the app.Searching “Medicare” in the Google app store, which is where Android users go, yielded many results. “What’s Covered” was first on the list, but it’s far from the only Medicare-related app on the platform. Same experience in the Apple app store, where it took the Roneys a few minutes to sort out exactly which one was the CMS tool. (It’s the one that says “Official Medicare coverage app,” made by the “Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.”)Having completed this part of the process, we moved on.Opening the app immediately gave each of us a search bar to type in a product or service.

(CMS declined a request for an interview.)But much like the medicare.gov website, it doesn’t delve into individual beneficiaries’ specifics. It doesn’t ask what other coverage he or she might have, so it can’t take into account supplementary insurance, deductibles, coinsurance or other factors that determine cost.“While usable and good for general information, it doesn’t provide personalized information that might be more helpful in making treatment or access decisions,” said Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit organization.Milt’s wife, Lisa Roney, 70, joined him to participate in my own “expert panel,” to download the app and try it out.It’s worth noting that these experts were my backup plan. The first couple I approached told me that they’d love to help, but they had “dumb phones” and wouldn’t be able to download anything.This highlights perhaps a more fundamental problem. Many people of Medicare age don’t have a smartphone, and aren’t familiar with apps or comfortable manipulating screens.According to a report from AARP, 46 percent of people in their 60s do not have smartphones. Only 29 percent of the 70-and-older crowd do. The report suggests that the trend will tick upward, with more older Americans owning mobile technology each year.The Roneys both have Medicare Part A and B, which covers hospitalizations and doctor visits. They both have smartphones. As retired government workers, they also both have insurance from GEHA, the Government Employees Health Association, which covers their dental care, prescription drugs and some other expenses. Milt Roney gets some money from GEHA to hand out brochures at health fairs.They consider themselves pretty tech-savvy. They have iPads, personal computers and iPhones. Lisa Roney wears a Fitbit.But they immediately questioned the necessity of the app.“I’d just pick up the phone and call if I had a question about what was covered,” Milt Roney said.“I’d probably just look it up in the [Medicare] book,” Lisa Roney said, pulling the 2-inch manual from a drawer in her office.Then came the first hurdle: downloading the app.Searching “Medicare” in the Google app store, which is where Android users go, yielded many results. “What’s Covered” was first on the list, but it’s far from the only Medicare-related app on the platform. Same experience in the Apple app store, where it took the Roneys a few minutes to sort out exactly which one was the CMS tool. (It’s the one that says “Official Medicare coverage app,” made by the “Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.”)Having completed this part of the process, we moved on.Opening the app immediately gave each of us a search bar to type in a product or service.

5c92c7c449f0eacbf105e2b1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/ethiopian-airlines-boeing.html,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopian Airlines surpassed many carriers by becoming one of the first to install a simulator to teach pilots how to fly the new Boeing 737 Max 8, but the captain of the doomed Flight 302 never trained on the simulator, according to people close to the airline’s operations.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Ethiopian Airlines had not authorized disclosure of the information, said the carrier had the Max 8 simulator up and running in January, two months before Flight 302 crashed.Boeing has said that experienced 737 pilots needed little training for the new Max 8, an assertion that has now come under close scrutiny by regulatory officials and pilots at other airlines. Two of the planes have fatally crashed in the past five months, and regulators around the world grounded all Max 8s last week.The pilot of Flight 302, Yared Getachew, who had 8,000 hours of flying experience including on the 737, took a refresher course on a different simulator in late September and early October, according to one person familiar with the airline, and was not due for another round of simulator training until after the crash on March 10.It was unclear if the second pilot on Flight 302, the co-pilot, had trained on the Max 8 simulator. Nor was it clear if the airline had used the simulator for refresher courses it requires pilots to take every six months, or only to train new pilots.Still, use of the simulator by Ethiopian Airlines means the carrier was among the few in the world that not only had a working simulator for Boeing Max jets but was using it a few months after the first Max 8 crash, Lion Air Flight 610.Despite Boeing’s assertions that the plane was safe, the crashes have raised questions about whether Boeing and its American regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, did enough to train pilots on how to deal with the Max 8’s new features, in particular an automated system to prevent stalls known as MCAS.Hours after this article was published, Ethiopian Airlines tweeted a statement challenging what it described as “wrong reporting” without specifying what was incorrect.The statement said its pilots had been “made aware” and had been “well briefed on” an emergency directive issued by the F.A.A. following the Lion Air accident. The airline also said that its simulator “is not designed to simulate the MCAS system problems.”The airline’s statement did not include information on the captain’s simulator training. However, its statement said that its pilots had completed “differences training” recommended by Boeing and approved by the F.A.A. before they switched to flying the Max 8 jets from an earlier Boeing 737 model.The New York Times issued a statement that it stood by the reporting in the article.Boeing said that pilots who had flown earlier models did not need additional simulator training, and even after the October crash in Indonesia, the F.A.A. agreed.Many pilots learned the new features of the Boeing Max on an iPad, and many were not originally informed of the existence of the automated system, which can push the plane’s nose down if it is approaching a stall.The Ethiopian and Lion Air flights crashed minutes after takeoff and showed similar up-and-down oscillations before fatal nose-dives. A central focus of the Indonesian investigation is the possibility that the automated system pushed the nose down into a fatal dive because of inaccurate input from a sensor.The Ethiopian Flight 302 crash killed all 157 aboard and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash killed all 189.Even if both pilots on Flight 302 had trained on the simulator, it is unclear if such preparation would have included maneuvers to deal with the kinds of problems they may have faced.In a bulletin issued in November, Boeing said that emergency procedures that applied to earlier 737 models would have corrected the problems that may have contributed to the Max 8 crash in Indonesia.Pilots for Ethiopian Airlines, who declined to speak on the record, said they paid close attention to bulletins issued by aircraft manufacturers, especially following an accident. One pilot said failing to read the bulletins would be tantamount to “walking out of your house naked.”The Ethiopian crash has brought new scrutiny to the system Boeing put in its new Max planes to prevent stalls, called MCAS. The system was designed to compensate for changes to the aerodynamics that arose from alterations to the size and position of the engines on the wings.The pilots on the doomed Lion Air flight did not appear to understand why the jet was tipping downward and how to correct that problem. One flipped through a technical manual, and the other began to pray, according to the cockpit voice recording.An investigation is still underway to determine what caused the crash in Ethiopia. A possible fault in the MCAS system is part of the inquiry, and the authorities in Ethiopia have said that a preliminary review of the “black boxes” — voice recording and flight data — revealed similarities to the Indonesian crash.But experts have cautioned that any conclusions at this stage of an investigation are preliminary and could change.On Wednesday in Washington, the F.A.A. published a notification to regulators in other countries reiterating that Boeing was preparing a software upgrade for the 737 Max along with training to accompany the updated software.The F.A.A. said its review of the new software and training was “an agency priority, as will be the rollout of any software, training or other measures to operators of the 737 Max.”The message from the F.A.A. did not reveal any new information about what may have led to the crash in Ethiopia. “Understanding the circumstances that contributed to this accident is critical in developing further actions and returning aircraft to service,” the F.A.A. said.In a further sign of scrutiny facing Boeing and the F.A.A., a Senate subcommittee on aviation and space said it was planning a hearing next Wednesday on airline safety.“In light of the recent tragedy in Ethiopia and the subsequent grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, this hearing will examine challenges to the state of commercial aviation safety, including any specific concerns highlighted by recent accidents,” the subcommittee said in a statement."
5c2e756f3a125f5075c02baf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/apple-revenue-china-innovation.html,"If anything, MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It’s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed — the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue of Ember magazine and, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. “Let’s be buds” urges a sign on one table.It certainly looks like it’s going great at this chain of weed dispensaries. But — like a lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in California — MedMen is struggling. The latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed a net loss of $66 million on revenues of $21.5 million. It had lost $79 million the previous quarter.Not enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMen’s problems, but the disconnect between the company’s promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week: Apple’s announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Apple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes. It is, to use an old California trope, going to be a real bummer for Silicon Valley.Now stick with me here, because what’s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?Apple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook. He, of course, was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs, who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in 1997. Since then, it has been all uphill, to the point this summer when Apple reached a $1 trillion valuation — the first publicly traded American company to reach that high — with a price of $207.39 a share.ImageAn Apple Store in Grand Central Terminal in New York.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesToday it’s trading at $142.64, and analysts are predicting it will settle around $135. Yipes. Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China, where Apple products are popular, and the Trump administration’s trade war. But as Ina Fried of Axios noted: “The problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple. But Apple’s iPhone problems extend far beyond China, too.”Indeed. The last big innovation explosion — the proliferation of the smartphone — is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a “Cambrian explosion,” a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify. Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.Apple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.That business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don’t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it’s apparent that it’s now winding down.This is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward. The last cool set of companies — Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and, yes, Tinder — were created many years ago, and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising.Well, rental scooters. O.K., they’re cool, but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now. How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.Where is that next spark that will light us all up?Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

5c8bf89c49f0eacbf105d4fe,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/business/boeing-ethiopian-crash.html,"Investigators at the crash site of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight have found new evidence that points to another connection to the earlier disaster involving the same Boeing jet.The evidence, a piece of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet that crashed in Ethiopia last weekend killing 157 people, suggests that the plane’s stabilizers were tilted upward, according to two people with knowledge of the recovery operations. At that angle, the stabilizers would have forced down the nose of the jet, a similarity with the Lion Air crash in October.Although the crash investigations are still in the early phases, the new evidence potentially indicates that the two planes both had problems with a newly installed automated system on the 737 Max jet intended to prevent a stall.This evidence ultimately contributed to American regulators’ decision to ground the 737 Max this week, according to the two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had found physical evidence from the Ethiopian crash that, along with satellite tracking data, suggested similarities between the two crashes.As the investigations continue, Boeing has also been racing to finish a software update for the 737 Max aircraft, which is expected by April. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have continued to stand by the safety of the plane. Yet Boeing’s update will modify features of the jet around the automated system that investigators have suggested might have played a role in the Lion Air crash.Why Investigators Fear the Two Boeing 737s Crashed for Similar ReasonsThe planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights.The new evidence found at the crash site in Ethiopia, a piece of equipment known as a jackscrew, controls the angle of the horizontal stabilizers. The stabilizers can be triggered by the automated system, known as MCAS.The stabilizers could have been tilted upward for other reasons. Authorities in France are analyzing the black boxes of the Ethiopian Airlines plane for more information.Indonesian and American authorities are also looking into whether MCAS contributed to the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people in October. In that disaster, the automated system, possibly based on faulty sensor readings, may have repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down, creating a struggle between the new flight control system and the pilots.After the Lion Air crash, Boeing backed the safety its planes and 737 Max aircraft continued to crisscross the planet. In the background, Boeing has been working on a software update for the planes.Boeing designed the 737 Max as an updated, more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling 737 aircraft. The Max’s engines were bigger and mounted farther forward on its wings, a configuration that could push the nose upward toward a stall in certain circumstances. To compensate for that, Boeing installed MCAS to automatically push the nose down to counteract those forces, in the hopes of making the 737 Max safer and able to handle like its predecessors.That similarity was part of Boeing’s pitch to the F.A.A. and airlines: Because the plane handled like previous 737s, pilots would not need to be retrained to fly it. Regulators and carriers agreed, and the pilots’ 737 Max training typically amounted to a course on an iPad and a few white papers.Why the 737 That Crashed Is Boeing’s Best-Selling Plane EverJumbo jets are being replaced by planes like the Boeing 737: smaller, fuel-efficient aircraft capable of traveling greater distances.The automated system, which may have pushed down the nose of the aircraft in the Lion Air crash, activates if just one of two sensors mounted on the aircraft’s exterior says the nose is too high. That means a single malfunctioning sensor could force the plane in the wrong direction, as has been theorized in the Lion Air crash.Boeing is updating the software to require data from both sensors for the system to kick in, according to pilots at several major airlines and two lawmakers briefed on the matter.Modern aircraft are built with backups and redundancies for virtually every crucial component. So when something breaks — as things often do — it won’t threaten the safety of a flight. Boeing’s software fix indicates that the plane maker shipped the 737 Max with a single point of failure, a potentially dangerous anomaly in aviation, and the Federal Aviation Administration approved it.Such a single point of failure on a modern jet is rare and far riskier than having backup systems, said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at American Airlines’ pilots union and a 737 captain. “A single point of failure on a significant system that points my nose towards the ground?” he said. “Now that to me seems just a little bit over the line.”Boeing has also said its software fix would cause the automated system to push the nose down at a slower rate, Mr. Michaelis said. The system currently pushes the nose down by 2.7 degrees in 10 seconds, Mr. Michaelis said. “That’s a pretty aggressive pitch down,” he said, particularly just after takeoff.The update will also deal with another concern in the wake of the Lion Air crash: pilots fighting with MCAS.In 12 Minutes, Everything Went WrongHow the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.Investigators have said it appears that the Lion Air pilots repeatedly pulled the plane’s nose back up after the automated system pushed it down. This continued until it was too late and the aircraft slammed into the Java Sea.The system is designed to push down the nose of the aircraft if sensors are saying it is necessary — overriding what pilots may be trying to do. The software update would limit the number of times MCAS tries to push down the nose, preventing it from struggling with a pilot, according to the pilots.Boeing has indicated the software fix will “make an already safe aircraft even safer.” The F.A.A. has said it expects to tell airlines “no later than April” to incorporate the software fix.Pilots at American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines said they still generally felt comfortable flying the 737 Max jets, in part because they are now aware of the automated system. Boeing did not fully disclose the system to pilots until after the Lion Air crash.Reviews of tens of thousands of 737 Max flights at American, Southwest and United showed the automated system never activated, presumably because their pilots never forced the noses of their aircraft too high. Some pilots said they were concerned the system could be activated by a single inaccurate sensor, pushing the plane toward the ground right after takeoff, when the margin for error was thin. But they added that in that situation, they could always flip a switch to automatically turn off systems like MCAS.“It is, of course, a concern for pilots,” said James LaRosa, a United Airlines’ 737 pilot and union official. “But if it happened to me or our pilots, I know that our pilots would react.”"

The clangs and bangs of thrown objects don’t help.Ms. Jimenez said caring for Jasleen, who is deaf and has trouble communicating, has made her feel perpetually unsettled. She has two other daughters, as well, and is candid about feeling overwhelmed.“It’s hard, hard, hard, hard,” said Ms. Jimenez, 31, last month at her apartment in the East Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. “Everywhere we go, she cries like that or screams or throws herself on the floor.”Throughout her pregnancy with Jasleen, Ms. Jimenez was very ill. During a routine checkup at 35 weeks, she said her doctors detected abnormalities with the fetus. Ms. Jimenez developed high blood pressure, a result of pre-eclampsia, which was interfering with oxygen levels to Jasleen’s brain. The high risks of the delivery were kept from Ms. Jimenez, but doctors told family members, she said.“I saw everybody crying, but I didn’t know what was happening,” Ms. Jimenez recalled. “I thought they were happy because the baby was going to be born.”Jasleen arrived through an emergency cesarean section in 2009. Doctors determined that she had been infected by a virus called cytomegalovirus, or CMV. Like Zika, CMV can cause serious health problems for unborn babies. Jasleen was given slim odds of survival and sent to the Long Island Jewish Medical Center for treatment.She was connected to a maze of tubes, heightening her mother’s panic. When after a week, Jasleen began feeding on her own, Ms. Jimenez was awash with relief.ImageMs. Jimenez with her youngest daughter, Juliette, and oldest, Jasleen.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York TimesThough she survived, the virus caused microcephaly and cerebral palsy, and Jasleen regularly had seizures. The left side of her body is paralyzed; the atrophy is worsening with age and impeding her already limited mobility.“I feel like I have three children just with her,” said Ms. Jimenez. “I have to do everything for her.”In addition to Jasleen, Ms. Jimenez has two other daughters: Jeyleen, 8, and Juliette, who is almost 2. Ms. Jimenez, who is separated from her husband, relied heavily on her sister to babysit until she went away to college and misses the reprieves, when she would have a chance to walk through a park.“Sometimes I need to think or leave because I get crazy,” Ms. Jimenez said.Of late, she has no real time to herself. Her two older daughters go to school, but Juliette stays home. And many days, Jasleen cannot attend school for health reasons. Ms. Jimenez feels isolated.ImageMs. Jimenez’s daughters in their Brooklyn apartment. The left side of Jasleen’s body is paralyzed, and the atrophy is worsening.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times“I don’t invite anybody or go to anybody’s house,” she said. “I don’t get to sit. I have to be running after her. I don’t go anywhere.”Ms. Jimenez takes medication for anxiety and depression and has been seeing a therapist for nearly a year, which has led her to consider a job in the mental health field. Years ago, she enrolled in nursing school but did not finish because of Jasleen’s medical emergencies.Until recently, Ms. Jimenez was trying to make ends meet by working part-time at a beauty salon her mother owns, though she stopped after her sister left for college.She was reluctant to place her daughter in the care of a home health aide. However, her therapist helped her understand its necessity. Last month, the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities informed Ms. Jimenez that she was eligible to hire a caretaker. Ms. Jimenez said she would want that person to shadow her for two months to observe every nuance of Jasleen’s care before she would leave them alone. “I know it’s hard with her,” she said.ImageThe family received help from Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.CreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York TimesTo help Jasleen better communicate, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $579.78 in Neediest funds to buy her an Apple iPad and a specialized app for it. It also serves as a source of entertainment — playing videos or music — and distraction.Jasleen and her mother know limited sign language. Jasleen’s disabilities have made it difficult to communicate in complete sentences. Often, she is able to sign only a single word. Most of their interactions are driven by a hand-gesture language of their own. To ask Jasleen if she needs water, Ms. Jimenez mimes tipping back an invisible glass.“I know her,” she said. “I know what she wants.”Ms. Jimenez is eager to return to work and believes having a home health aide will give her that chance. She has a dream of one day returning to school. And although she admits that it is difficult to get out of bed some days, Ms. Jimenez is fiercely committed to her daughters.One important tradition in their home is Family Friday. Every week, Ms. Jimenez orders pizza, breaks out board games and puts YouTube music videos on TV for karaoke performances. Jasleen interacts with her sisters, molding Play-Doh sculptures or brightening coloring books alongside them.Her romping children create a pleasant sound, one Ms. Jimenez doesn’t mind at all."
5ca7c7b449f0eacbf1f8141a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/sports/carlos-beltran-yankees.html,"TAMPA, Fla. — Over the winter, there was an unusual sight in the offices of Yankee Stadium. For a few days, amid the busy period as front-office employees reshaped rosters with trades and signings, Carlos Beltran was sitting among them, learning how to use the club’s internal networks to view video and file scouting reports.In December, a year after considering him for their managerial vacancy, the Yankees hired Beltran, a nine-time All-Star who spent two and a half seasons with the Yankees, as a special adviser to General Manager Brian Cashman. While front-office positions like special adviser or special assistant can often be nebulous roles handed to former managers, coaches or players who assist at their leisure — Alex Rodriguez, Mariano Rivera and David Wright, to name a few — Cashman said Beltran was approaching his job with a full-time student’s mind-set.“Some parachute in and out, which is great,” Cashman said. “But some are heavily invested, and he is heavily invested.”Beltran, 41, retired in 2017 after finally winning a World Series, with the Houston Astros. The title capped what some believe is a career with Hall of Fame credentials: 435 home runs (fourth most by a switch-hitter), 2,725 hits and three Gold Glove awards in addition to his All-Star selections.And after earning more than $220 million over 20 years in the major leagues, Beltran could be doing anything now, such as sitting on the beach in his native Puerto Rico. But he has chosen to work in the Yankees’ front office, writing his version of scouting reports and counseling the younger players throughout the organization.ImageBeltran, 41, retired after finally winning a World Series, with the Houston Astros in 2017.CreditMatt Slocum/Associated Press“I had a career in baseball, I played at a high level, and I made a lot of money in the big leagues, but man, I want these kids to accomplish their dreams,” he said in Spanish during spring training at the team’s facility in Tampa, Fla. “Those were my dreams, too.”Before the Yankees settled on Aaron Boone as their replacement for Joe Girardi before the 2017 season, Cashman asked Beltran to interview for the manager opening. Beltran had just finished playing, and thus had no background in management, but Cashman admired Beltran for his experience, his commanding presence and his genuine personality.“There’s passion and joy he brings every day,” Cashman said. “He’s capable of anything he wants to do.”So Cashman contacted Beltran again, this time about a front-office position. Beltran, who lives in New York, told Cashman what he was interested in working on, and Cashman gave him the freedom to do so. For Beltran, the chance to learn the intricacies of the front office from Cashman, who has won four World Series during his two decades as the Yankees’ general manager, was enticing.“Now it’s my turn to ask a lot of questions, see what interests me and knock on the needed doors to learn baseball from another point of view,” Beltran said.For Beltran, that view is from the stands, where the scouts sit and analyze the Yankees’ minor league teams during the season. It’s a different perspective, but Beltran gave himself plenty of training for his new job during his playing days. On road trips, he often spent traveling time watching video of the opposing team’s pitchers and hitters on his iPad and then shared his written notes with teammates and coaches. If his team was trading for a new teammate, he would call friends on the player’s former team to get the lowdown on the new acquisition and his personality.ImageBeltran spent two and a half seasons playing with the Yankees during his 20-year career.CreditAdam Hunger/Associated Press“I’m passionate about this,” he said. “Since I lived the game, I don’t just talk about the visual aspects, but the feelings of the player or what he might be thinking in difficult situations that sometimes analytics cannot see. The front office looks a lot at the numbers, but I’m talking about the mental side that has value. It’s a cool combination.”Beltran spent the winter writing and filing notes on several dozen players, mostly on prospects in the Yankees’ system but also some major leaguers. It took him 90 minutes to watch video on a player and write up his thoughts, he said. He averaged two per day.“He’s breaking swings down and he’s breaking down the pitching mechanics,” said Matt Daley, the Yankees’ assistant director of pro scouting. “He’s getting pretty detailed. It’s good information.”Beltran has also given the Yankees his perspective on how prospects can be helped to develop, particularly those from Latin America. As a player, Beltran encouraged clubs to hire Spanish-language interpreters to prevent messages from getting lost in translation between players and the team or reporters. Language barriers still persist today, he said, and can be factors in players’ growth.“He’s speaking from the perspective of a guy who’s just off the field and sees it through a player’s lens, which is a unique aspect,” said Tim Naehring, the Yankees’ vice president for baseball operations. “We don’t have many other guys writing reports or putting their opinions down coming from a teammate’s side of things.”Beltran will also counsel players throughout the season, as he did during two trips to the Yankees’ spring training this year. He will juggle that plus time at home with his wife and three young children and his baseball academy in Puerto Rico.ImageBeltran has given the Yankees his perspective on how to develop young players, particularly those from Latin America.CreditEve Edelheit for The New York Times“Now, it’s about how I can impact the younger players,” he said. “If they can get something out of one conversation or one bit of advice, then at the end of the day, that’s your legacy.”Among the players Beltran has advised are infielder Gleyber Torres, 22, and outfielder Estevan Florial, 21, the team’s top prospect, who broke a wrist during spring training. Torres, who is from Venezuela, said he had sought out Beltran for tips on improving his focus and taking better care of his body.“I’ll keep talking to him and, if anything is needed, I have the trust to ask and know he’ll have an answer,” Torres said.Florial, who is from the Dominican Republic, said Beltran had advised him on how to better use his legs in his swing and how to sharpen aspects of his defense. “To take the time to help someone who isn’t even a big-leaguer is really great,” he said.So how do all these responsibilities fit into Beltran’s future? Asked if he wanted to run a team one day, either as a manager or as an executive, Beltran would say only that he loved baseball and wanted to learn new skills.“This will help me if in some future I want to manage, then I understand how an organization thinks, how to develop an organization, and how they evaluate players,” he said. “But in the future, if I say that managing isn’t for me, maybe I want to be more involved in a front office, I have more tools.”"

David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent based in Washington, discussed the tech he’s using.You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan, one of your many roles for the newspaper. When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s, what tech were you equipped with?In retrospect, nothing very impressive. Our “portable” computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter, had a tiny cathode-ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory, which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives.Needless to say, it was a technology whose time never arrived. Oh, and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top. You put the handset of a hard-line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second. Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room, where someone would type out the story that you read to them.When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops, I sent a note to New York asking what to do with these dinosaurs. The answer I got back was: Your office looks out over Tokyo Bay. Figure it out.ImageMr. Sanger uses his laptop, a Logitech camera, two phones, a hot spot and battery pack to do his work.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesSo today the technology is lots faster, but perhaps not a lot more reliable. What’s the worst tech failure you’ve suffered?Naturally, things die when deadlines are tightest. There was the time I was rushing off the back stairs of Air Force One in the Middle East with an open laptop, story half-written and late to the editing desk, and managed to drop my computer 20 feet on the tarmac. (Not good.) I’ve had modems die in Egypt, and the blue screen of death crawl across my laptop in India. Power supplies don’t like variable current — I’ve melted my share.This has all made me focus intently on what NASA calls “mission-critical components.” If you can’t file your story — or record video, or connect up with “The Daily’’ — you might as well not be there. So I travel with a laptop and a backup iPad with a keyboard, so there is always a way to write. I take two phones — and two booster battery packs. I carry an AT&T portable hot spot, and still I’ve had to fall back at times on the built-in Wi-Fi hot spot on my iPhone. Oh, and a Logitech camera that allows me to do TV hits over a Skype connection without using the built-in pinhole camera in the laptop. So my backpack weighs plenty — and my wife and our sons think carrying it everywhere is faintly ridiculous. Until they run out of cellphone power.You’d think that belt-and-suspenders approach would cover everything. It doesn’t. In Hanoi, Vietnam, this year for a summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, we were, as my colleague Edward Wong put it, “comms cursed.” Lots of things failed. It didn’t help that I was staying in the Metropole hotel, where the meeting was being held, and security personnel blanketed the lobby with a cellphone suppression technology that keeps terrorists from detonating bombs remotely. Turns out it also keeps reporters from updating their stories on the web.You published your third book, “The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age,” last year. It’s a geopolitical look at how nations are using cyberweapons, and not just for espionage. Ever been a target?I’m afraid that if you are in my line of work — writing about the intersection of technology, spying, cybersabotage and national power — you attract attention from intelligence services. In Beijing in 2017 with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, I made the mistake of looking up something about the Tiananmen Square massacre from my hotel room, over a portable hot spot. Big mistake. The hot spot stopped working. I couldn’t revive it in Japan, or back at home. We later determined that Chinese intelligence had fried the firmware.A few years ago I began seeing that big red banner over my email account that declared: “We have detected a state-sponsored attacker seeking to obtain your data.” That could be anyone: Russians who didn’t like our investigations into the 2016 presidential election and subsequent hacks; Chinese People’s Liberation Army officers who didn’t care for our work exposing Unit 61398, which stole intellectual property; North Koreans who didn’t like our coverage of the Sony hack, the Bangladeshi central bank cyberheist or the cyberattacks on their missiles.And I’ve survived enough F.B.I. leak investigations to become mildly paranoid about our own government.ImageBose noise-canceling headphones are among the equipment that Mr. Sanger takes everywhere.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesSo what do you use to protect yourself?There is no permanent technological solution to hacking, data manipulation and, soon, deep fakes — like climate change, this is a problem we have to manage. Ultimately, we will need a mix of technology, political agreements and retaliatory responses that establish that attacks are not cost-free.That said, I’m a big fan of Google’s Advanced Protection program. It uses a combination of a key that fits in a USB slot (with a button that must be pressed) and a Bluetooth dongle, each registered to your computer or cellphone. Try to get access to someone’s accounts on a computer without that hardware present and you don’t get in.If you were cyber king for a day, what mandates would you issue?First, I’d ban the use of any voting machine that doesn’t rely on a hand-marked paper ballot, so there is something to count later. I’d require encryption for all personal information that you are asked turn over, including when I hand my passport to a hotel clerk. (Hear that, Marriott? It’s time.) And I’d make it illegal to have Social Security numbers used as an identifier on any electronic document, site, app or password combination. It’s the one number in your life you simply cannot change, without extraordinary effort. It was never intended to be used as a secure identifier. So let’s not try.ImageThe reel of Mr. Sanger’s fishing rod.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesImageAssorted flies used for fly fishing.CreditRosie Brock for The New York TimesWhat favorite cool technology do you always take with you?Sanity-preservation devices that cut me off from the world, from editors and from the complaints of presidents, secretaries of state and national security officials. The three most vital: Bose noise-canceling headphones, a small shortwave radio and a seven-piece, four-weight fly rod that breaks down to fit in a tube under a foot long. When the weather warms up, I carry the rod in that overloaded backpack along with a reel and a box of flies. No batteries required. I’ve been known to sneak out of hotels in early-morning hours to cast into rivers, harbors, ponds, you name it. I don’t even care if nothing’s biting — the casting is therapeutic.Don’t tell the bosses, O.K.?"
5c36557b3a125f5075c0398e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/technology/ces.html,"LAS VEGAS — The show must go on. That sentiment couldn’t have been stronger this week at CES, the largest consumer electronics convention in the country. The conference, which brought more than 180,000 people to Las Vegas, was a reminder of what the tech industry is best at: being optimistic about itself.ImageCreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesWho cares about the abysmal stock market and growing fears that we are sliding into a recession?

The conference offered a peek at the year’s hottest tech trends, including artificially intelligent virtual assistants, next-generation wireless networks and connected cars.ImageMengze Han taking a break in the South Hall.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesAnd companies unveiled thousands of products. Google and Amazon showed car accessories, alarm clocks and speakers that can be controlled with their virtual assistants by speaking commands like “Hey, Google, what’s the weather today?” or “Alexa, what’s my sports update?”VideoGuests walk through a display for the consumer electronics company LG at CES.CreditCreditVideo by Joe BuglewiczLG lured attendees into its giant booth with televisions that can be rolled up as if they were yoga mats.Wireless carriers and chip makers highlighted 5G, the next-generation cellular network arriving this year in a small number of cities with data speeds so zippy that devices can download an entire movie in seconds.ImageExploring the Qualcomm 5G booth.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesThe most surprising news came when a host of tech companies announced they were working with Apple to bring some of the company’s content and virtual assistant capabilities to their devices.Vizio, the TV maker, said its newer TVs would work with AirPlay, an Apple software feature for streaming video and audio content from an iPhone or Mac to a television screen. People will be able to speak to Siri on their iPhones to play content they had purchased from iTunes on the Vizio TVs. Samsung, Sony and LG announced similar partnerships with Apple.In the past, AirPlay and iTunes videos were mostly tied to Apple-made hardware like the Apple TV set-top box. Their expansion to third parties underlines Apple’s ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services. That’s especially important now that sales of Apple’s cash cow, the iPhone, are slowing. This month, the company reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years.The move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by Apple to open its technology to other companies, including competitors like Samsung.In a statement provided by Samsung, Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet software and services, said that with the expansion of iTunes and AirPlay, “iPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home.”ImageInteracting with facial-recognition software.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesFront and center at CES was the battle between virtual assistants — namely Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant. Google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with Assistant, including smart watches, speakers and displays. The company said a billion devices now work with its assistant, up from 400 million last year. Google wants to make the Assistant the focal point of a consumer’s life: in the home, in the car and on mobile devices.“When I walk down the aisle at Home Depot, will all the devices I might buy work with the Assistant?” Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant, said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats. “The answer is yes.”Amazon also had a large presence at the show. It filled a large conference room at the Venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with Alexa, including an Audi car, a motorcycle helmet and a stereo system.The battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices. Many of the smart gadgets at CES worked with multiple virtual assistants. Aaron Emigh, chief executive of Brilliant, which makes smart home products that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together, not against one another, because the smart home was already too complex, with products like light switches, thermostats and cameras coming from different brands.“The more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home, the more important that it all works together,” he said.ImageAmazon's Alexa technology made its way into car dashboards.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesCar manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and 5G wireless connections. But consumers won’t be able to buy self-driving vehicles from a dealership anytime soon, in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars. Smarter cars with features like built-in voice assistants to help people use maps, play music or get a sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now, however.If the economy does cool off, sales of cutting-edge gadgets will drop. Fast. But that didn’t faze people here. None of the CES attendees I spoke to expressed concern.Matt Strauss, who oversees Comcast’s Xfinity internet and cable service, was especially bullish about the year ahead. He said just about everything announced at CES required an internet connection, so that’s the last thing that people would cut off. “It’s become like oxygen,” he said."
5c99122349f0eacbf105eee8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/technology/apple-news-streaming-service.html,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple unveiled a new video streaming service on Monday with a parade of celebrities rarely seen on a stage outside of Hollywood’s awards season, with heavyweight directors like Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams and stars like Octavia Spencer and Jennifer Aniston.Oprah Winfrey even served as the closer for the nearly two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. “They’re in a billion pockets, y’all,” Ms. Winfrey said of Apple’s global reach. “A billion pockets.”As enthusiastic as the entertainment industry appears to be to work with Apple, it is increasingly clear that Apple needs Hollywood. After years of record profits, the company is slowing down. Phone sales are cooling, and despite the relative popularity of products like the Apple Watch, the next big thing has eluded the Silicon Valley giant.Now, short of another game-changing gadget and facing tough competition from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, Apple is trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years. The company unveiled an expansive strategy to push consumers to do more than just buy its hardware products. It has plans for new monthly subscription services for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card.The new services represent an evolution of Apple’s business. For years, Apple focused mainly on selling devices, counting on consumers to upgrade phones and tablets every few years. Now the company is keying on selling content and services for its roughly 1.4 billion active devices, which include Apple TV boxes, Apple Watches, Mac computers and iPads.The streaming service is called Apple TV Plus. After years of speculation about what an Apple alternative to Netflix might look like, the company offered few details about the new offering — but plenty of razzle dazzle. Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Kumail Nanjiani, Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard — even Big Bird from Sesame Street — also joined Apple executives on the stage.At the heart of Apple TV Plus will be new original programs. It will not carry advertising and will begin this fall in more than 100 countries. It will also include programs from other television networks like HBO, Showtime, Starz and CBS.ImageFrom left, Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston announce Apple’s new streaming services.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesBut some of the biggest questions going into the Apple event were not answered, starting with price. The stars talked about their new programs, but the broad story lines of the shows were already known.Mr. Spielberg was the first Hollywood celebrity to take the stage, and he received the morning’s first standing ovation. “This is my first time at Apple,” he said.Mr. Spielberg was also speaking for many in the entertainment industry who were making their first trip to Apple’s campus 300 miles north from Los Angeles. Since October 2017, Apple has spent well over $1 billion on original programming. Five shows have completed filming, and another half-dozen will be finished in the coming months. Apple has ordered about two dozen series altogether.But Apple is coming late to the game. Netflix has been making original programming for seven years and will spend at least $10 billion on content this year. Amazon and Hulu have also made tremendous inroads with the industry.Apple’s entertainment foray could also lead to a culture clash. Silicon Valley and Hollywood operate in distinctly different ways: Apple prides itself on secrecy, while Hollywood runs on a wealth of information. Perhaps aware of this sensitivity, Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, began describing his company last week as an entertainment company instead of a tech company.Apple’s streaming music service has 56 million subscribers. It offers additional cloud storage for a monthly fee, and it takes a cut of the money spent on apps running on its devices, as well as a sliver of digital payments made by iPhones. Apple generated $10.9 billion from services in the last quarter of 2018, compared to $73.4 billion from hardware sales.The video service is the linchpin of Apple’s broader services push. In addition to customers paying $1,000 every two or three years for a new iPhone, Apple hopes they will also pay $10, $20, $30 or $40 a month a one-stop shop for content for all their devices.“In essence Apple is seeking to become a Netflix of everything in services; music, news and magazines, video and games,” said Paolo Pescatore, a technology, media and telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.ImageRoger Rosner, Apple’s vice president of apps, at Monday’s event.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesApple said its Apple News Plus subscription will include access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker, National Geographic and InStyle. It will also feature newspapers like The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. The subscription will cost $9.99 a month and is available beginning today in the United States and Canada.The subscription service builds on a free news app that the company released in late 2015 and comes installed on the company’s iOS software. Apple said about five billion articles are read monthly on Apple News.The price to be part of Apple’s paid news offering is steep. Apple is taking a 50 percent cut of the subscriptions, with the publications splitting what’s left over based on readership. Apple’s cut for news is larger than the 30 percent it takes for subscriptions bought in the App Store. Publishers expressed concern that Apple would maintain access to important consumer data such as credit cards and email addresses as part of the deal.The Wall Street Journal said its business stories and analysis would remain exclusive to its paying subscribers, but it sees an opportunity to reach a new category of readers for general interest news. The newspaper said it would add to its newsroom to support Apple News Plus. The New York Times and The Washington Post decided to not join the service.For video games, the company said it would start a subscription service called Apple Arcade this fall. It did not offer any pricing details for the service, but the company said this will allow people to try out new games. Apple said it will help foot some of the development costs for game developers.Apple also unveiled a credit card called Apple Card. Working in tandem with Goldman Sachs, the company said the new credit card is meant to work mainly on the iPhone — users can apply for the card on the phone and be instantly approved. It will reap bigger rewards if the consumer uses the card on Apple Pay, the company’s digital payment system.The credit card offers 2 percent cash back for spending on Apple Pay. Apple touted how it simplified credit card rewards with “daily cash” deposited back into the digital wallet on the iPhone shortly after purchasing an item.After its barrage of announcements, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, introduced Ms. Winfrey. Apple signed to a deal with her in June 2018. Ms. Winfrey said she was making two documentaries for Apple’s new video service and bringing her book club to the company and turn it into the “biggest, most vibrant, most stimulating” book club on the planet."
5c77fbb049f0eacbf105aaa0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/world/asia/trump-summit-north-korea.html,"HANOI, Vietnam — It was an unlikely bromance that began last summer in Singapore. The relationship seemed ready to blossom even more this week in Vietnam — until, suddenly, the date went sour.President Trump, who prides himself on his negotiating skills, began his second summit meeting with Kim Jong-un — the North Korean dictator who is believed to have ordered the killings of both his own uncle and half brother — with ardent wooing.“I think very importantly, the relationship is, you know, just very strong,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday morning as he sat with Mr. Kim before a phalanx of cameras at the Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital. “And when you have a good relationship, a lot of good things happen.”Mr. Kim, for his part, was equally gushing as he said that “nearly all of the world” was watching and was “probably thinking that they are seeing a scene from a fantasy movie now that they are seeing us spending wonderful time together facing each other.”As Mr. Trump spoke glowingly of North Korea’s economic potential, the two men seemed to mirror each other in body language. Both sat slightly forward in their chairs, one hand on one knee and the other leaning casually on the table between them, prompting analysts in South Korea to extrapolate closer and closer ties.ImageJournalists in Hanoi waiting for Mr. Trump to begin his news conference after his meeting with Mr. Kim abruptly ended.CreditSusan Walsh/Associated Press“This demonstrates that the relationship between the two has developed from that of negotiating partners to collaborators,” said Kim Yo-jong, an expert in nonverbal language who was interviewed on Channel A News in Seoul (and is no relation to Mr. Kim’s sister, who shares the same name and traveled with her brother to the Vietnam meeting).But just a few hours later, both men had abruptly pulled out of a planned lunch, leaving elegant place settings in a restaurant at the Metropole untouched.There would be no deal, and what had started as a day of harmony ended with both leaders speeding off in their motorcades with nary a final handshake for the cameras.It may not have matched the theatrics of the first meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim last June in Singapore, when Mr. Kim took a nighttime walk through the city center (and posed for selfies with the Singaporean foreign minister), and Mr. Trump showed Mr. Kim a slick Hollywood-style video on an iPad, touting the promising future he says awaits the North if it gives up its nuclear arms.Still, the sudden change of tone over a matter of hours on Thursday in Hanoi provided the kind of unpredictable sparks for which both men have come to be known.There were even a few surprises before the talks broke down.The day before Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Kim, the White House press corps was kicked out of the hotel where Mr. Kim was staying, indicating that the North Korean leader and his authoritarian hosts in Vietnam might try to curtail press freedom. Tensions with journalists were further stoked on Wednesday night when four reporters were barred from covering the kickoff dinner — not by Mr. Kim, but by the White House.VideoThe leader of North Korea answered three questions from reporters during his meetings with President Trump on Thursday. It was apparently the first time that Mr. Kim had responded to foreign journalists.CreditCreditEvan Vucci/Associated PressThe next day, Mr. Kim may have made history by answering not just one but three questions from foreign reporters.In the morning photo session on Thursday, Mr. Kim stunned the room and became an immediate sensation on social media when he answered a question from David Nakamura, a Washington Post reporter, about whether he was confident he would get a deal.“It’s too early to say,” Mr. Kim said through his interpreter. “I would not say I’m pessimistic.”During a later meeting between the leaders and their teams of negotiators, Mr. Kim answered two more questions from the news media. Asked about his willingness to denuclearize his country, Mr. Kim said, “If I’m not willing to do that, I wouldn’t be here right now.” Mr. Trump replied, “That might be the best answer you’ve ever heard.”But by lunchtime, when the leaders were scheduled to continue their discussions as they ate, it appeared that analysts might have read too much into the apparent conviviality.Mr. Trump also faced a major distraction in the form of congressional testimony from Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, who accused the president of a pattern of lies and criminality spanning years. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Cohen was “lying in order to reduce his prison time,” and then he retweeted himself on Thursday not long before his meeting with Mr. Kim.There was some speculation that Mr. Cohen’s testimony had so irked Mr. Trump that he had cut short the meeting. Certainly, when word arrived from the traveling press pool that the lunch had been delayed and then canceled, along with a planned signing ceremony for a joint declaration, reporters scrambled to figure out what had happened and why.ImageThe Vietnam meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was not quite as theatrical as their first one last June in Singapore, where Mr. Kim took a selfie with Vivian Balakrishnan, the Singaporean foreign minister. The theatrics were better at a meeting last June in Singapore, where Kim Jong-un posed for a selfie. CreditChris Mcgrath/Getty Images AsiaPacIn the international media center less than a mile from the Metropole, reporters frantically refreshed their Twitter feeds, seeking updates from their colleagues in the travel pool or looking for statements from the White House. Word came that Mr. Trump would hold a news conference almost two hours earlier than scheduled.Outside the Metropole, Mr. Trump’s motorcade pulled out. Black-suited North Korean security officers dashed into a line of black Toyota hatchbacks, a few of them jumping through the doors of cars that had already begun to roll.At the media center, slight mayhem broke out when reporters from a Japanese news network started to interview a reporter from Voice of America. Other reporters, thinking she was a White House spokeswoman, rushed over. Suddenly, a scrum of microphones and cellphones was thrust at the reporter.One of the reporters who had joined the crowd realized it was a case of hacks interviewing each other. “You’re just journalists?” she said in disgust. “Oh, my God, why did I run over here?” She stormed away.At Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday, he was clearly not as ebullient as he had been in Singapore, where he had answered questions for more than an hour and made an impromptu policy announcement when he said he would be suspending military exercises between United States and South Korean forces.But he remained emphatic that he and Mr. Kim were still on good terms. “I think the relationship is very warm,” he said. “And when we walked away, it was a very friendly walk.”There was no immediate way to confirm the statement."

And perhaps you, like me, have witnessed your darling child’s transformation from cuddly, relatable quasi-innocent to meme-spewing, floss-dancing obsessive.I sometimes wonder whether my 11-year-old son dreams in Fortnite. I know he browses for new costumes in the item shop with the same zeal with which my mother once combed the racks at Loehmann’s. And when he is not playing Fortnite, he is often watching YouTubers play Fortnite, yowling men-children who go by names like Ninja and Tfue and Fearless, spelled Fe4RLess, narrating their virtual exploits.But after several months of careful observation — during which I have not merely mom-tolerated Fortnite but actively spectated and interrogated and (yes! even!) participated — here is what I’ve concluded:I am pro.Not without qualification or caveat. But I’ve lately decided that many of us are thinking about this game the wrong way — including Prince Harry, who declared on Thursday that it really ought to be banned. A brief tutorial for the Fortnite unlettered: Think “The Hunger Games,” but with less gore and more contestants. Each player is dropped onto a candy-colored island and armed with only a pickax. He or she joins 99 others — some friends, perhaps, but mostly strangers (and mostly adults) — and spends the rest of the game scavenging for weapons, building fortifications, hiding, exploring and laying waste to everyone in sight. The last person standing wins.Also, it is officially named Fortnite Battle Royale. But no one calls it that.As a mother, I’ve never been much of a calamity howler, and having once written a book about parenthood, I know enough about the history of childhood to understand that most new forms of entertainment are met with gales of protest that in hindsight seem ridiculous. In the 1920s, social critics believed movies would turn our children to lives of wild delinquency. In the 1950s, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee held hearings about the moral dangers of comic books.But part of me, I’ll confess, was at sixes and sevens about the sudden appearance of this game. Why — and how — had it so quickly become the rabid preoccupation of so many?A great deal of the answer is that Fortnite is social. More than social, actually: It is, as the tech writer and developer Owen Williams has written, a destination, an actual place. “It’s like going to church, or the mall,” Williams explained on his blog, Charged, late last year, “except there’s an entire universe to mess around in together.”Which explains a certain wisecrack my son likes to make when he peels off to play. “I’m going to see my friends now,” he says, though he’s in fact joining them on his headset. Jumping into a game of Fortnite is paying a social call, the equivalent of dropping in on a cocktail party.That Fortnite is its own place — specifically “a third place,” or lively harbor for communities outside of home and work — matters quite a lot. Middle-class children today don’t have much freedom to find such places. They’re rigidly scheduled and aggressively sheltered — parents of my generation are more inclined to roll their children in bubble wrap and tuck them on a high shelf for storage than allow them to wander off to parks or shopping malls on their own. Gaming is their form of self-determination, a means to take control of their constricted, highly regimented lives. I’ll toss in at least one paradoxical, unanticipated benefit of this socializing, at least in my house: My son now demands to see far more of his friends in real life. All that socializing via headset has whetted his appetite for embodied interaction. (Perhaps he’s an outlier. But Williams says the same thing has happened to him.) Sometimes those play dates don’t even involve Fortnite. But when they do, they’re far more social than meets the eye. The kids aren’t just plugged into their devices, but to one another — barking orders, exchanging intel, passing joysticks, cracking jokes.“There’s just this nonstop talk,” said Clive Thompson, author of the excellent new “Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World.” “It’s like two people who are watching a sporting event together. Except they’re the athletes.” The classic mistake that adults make, Thompson adds, is that they focus entirely on the screen when they see children huddled around iPads and Switches, Xboxes and PlayStations. “What they don’t focus on,” he says, “is what’s happening inside the room.”A terrific article on Axios last Christmas articulated something I’d had a hard time putting words to: Fortnite is its own social network. It’s Facebook for a new generation of adults — and tweens, like my son.In a cage match between Facebook and Fortnite, I’ll choose Fortnite, thanks, where people actually talk to one another in real time.Are there unlovely, habit-forming aspects to the game? Yes. When I reached Owen Williams by phone, he said the game was devilishly good at lulling players into believing they’re closer to winning each time than they probably are. Psychologists call this the “near miss effect,” which incentivizes players to keep playing. And every two weeks, there are subtle shifts in how the game is played (with new weapons added, for instance, or taken away), a seductive trick.But the world my son is entering is already a blinking bazaar of distractions, engineered to hot-wire our attention. Instagram, Twitter, group texts, email, Gchat — all of them can turn us into compulsives if we’re not careful; all require self-regulation. Whenever adults fret about their children’s inability to control themselves, I think of the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips’s observation that perhaps it’s because adults identify so very well with this loss of control: We’re the ones who are alcoholics, gamblers, serial killers. Not kids. “Excessive behavior,” he wrote in “On Balance,” “is not so much something we grow out of as something we grow into.”Excessive gaming is just one more thing to guard against if you’ve got a teenager, along with alcohol and drug use. The problem existed long before Fortnite darkened our consoles.Here’s what I learned from my son: The real harms of Fortnite do not come from the game itself. He explained this once in a comment so casual and epigrammatic that I knew it instantly to be true. “When people are behaving badly during the game,” he said, “it’s 10 percent because of their personality, 10 percent because the game is getting stressful and 80 percent because they’re imitating YouTubers.”On YouTube, there are countless videos of adults playing Fortnite. They’re the game’s hidden influencers. Many of our kids, unbeknown to us, are taking their behavioral cues from them. Some are harmless, but some are not. YouTube, as we know, is algorithmically designed to show you the ugliest content in a hurry. Which generally means, in Fortnite’s case, a lot of trash talk and sore losing — and in the case of the fringier types, hate speech.So if we want to guard against the hazards of the game, maybe we should screen which videos our kids are watching. Or maybe just tell them to turn off YouTube altogether — and play more Fortnite instead.RelatedOpinion | Annalee Newitz: Why the Cool Kids Are Playing Dungeons & DragonsApril 6, 2019Opinion | Won Sang Choi: It’s Time to Make Video Games Safe for ChildrenNov. 12, 2018All We Want to Do Is Watch Each Other Play Video GamesMay 2, 2018Parenting the Fortnite AddictApril 30, 2018The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c87758149f0eacbf105c917,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/open-air-museums.html,"DAYTON, Ohio — Every Sunday from May to October, Larry Weinstein plays music for people here in Dayton, on the towering Deeds Carillon, which rises above the city’s south side. Suspended between four limestone columns, the carillon’s 57 bells cover two octaves and play in response to Mr. Weinstein’s touch on a keyboard.The 15-story tower is a beloved landmark. It is also one of many extra-large exhibits at Carillon Historical Park, a 65-acre open-air museum focusing on technology and innovation.Open-air museums, as their name implies, display their collections outdoors, often because of the size of the artifacts — though there is a wide variety in subject matter. A museum in Japan features a hotel entrance and lobby. In Germany, prehistoric homes can be toured.While the size of the exhibits can be jaw-dropping, the museums are not simply guardians of the tangible. Their curators say they are demonstrating the birth of an idea, acknowledging a developmental pivot point or preserving an era.Greenfield VillageOpened in 1929, Greenfield Village is actually just one part of a complex of museums and schools assembled by Henry Ford (and known together as the Henry Ford). The village is arranged like a small American town, using historic buildings, vehicles and equipment collected from all over the United States.The 83 large artifacts in the museum demonstrate America’s transition from agriculture to industry, and highlight the history of the people who designed, worked or lived in them.ImageThe Sarah Jordan boardinghouse in Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich., is part of a complex of museums and schools that is part of The Henry Ford.CreditThe Henry Ford“Ford wanted to remember the hard work and values of creating a country like America, and he wanted those to be preserved so people could learn from them,” said Patricia Mooradian, the president of the Henry Ford.For example, the tenacity required to endure and challenge slavery is explained through audio recordings of slave stories, piped into the small cottages where they lived on South Carolina’s Hermitage Plantation.Visitors can tour Thomas Edison’s Menlo Park laboratory and see how the inventor’s first experimental electric-lighting system was put into use at the Sarah Jordan boarding house, where his lab workers lived.Exhibits like these “provide a unique immersive educational experience,” Ms. Mooradian said. “Don’t ignore the power of an artifact. When I can put my hands on something, that memory stays with me.”Visitors can interact with the exhibits by watching wool be spun or by moving around the village in a historic steam train. Sometimes, museum presenters explain the artifacts using iPads and other technology and prod people to consider how they, too, can contribute to society.“Our whole museum is about the future,” Ms. Mooradian said. So when visitors are impressed by someone in the past, “they can think, ‘I can do that, too.’”Carillon Historical ParkGreenfield Village may also own the original home of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Dayton’s most famous sons, but Carillon Historical Park has the 1905 Wright Flyer III, the brothers’ first “practical airplane.”In addition to the Wright brothers, there were many others in Dayton who played important roles in the industrialization of America. They called themselves the “Barn Gang” because they worked in the backyard barn of the engineer and inventor Edward Deeds. That barn, now part of the museum, was the workshop for ideas like car ignitions and refrigerators and calculators.ImageThe only airplane that is also an American national historical landmark is Orville and Wilbur Wright’s Wright Flyer III in Dayton’s Carillon Historical Park.CreditDan PattersonThe Wright Flyer III, which is a national landmark, is perhaps the museum’s most famous exhibit. But the exhibition space is important as well because figuring out how to show it off was also Orville Wright’s idea. He designed the circular structure that gives visitors a 360-degree view of the Flyer.“It was the world’s first pilot’s last project,” said Alex Heckman, vice president for museum operations.In another tribute to the longevity of some inventions, a 150-year-old brewery at the park still makes beer using original methods and serves food — so the exhibit does double duty as the museum cafe.Skogar MuseumThe recorded history of Iceland spans more than a millennium, but its transition from an agricultural feudal state to modern society was compressed into just seven decades.“For 1,000 years, daily life basically did not change much,” said Andri Gudmundsson, the managing director of the Skogar Museum on Iceland’s southern coast.ImageThe Skogar Museum, on Iceland’s southern coast, features several reconstructed turf homes.CreditSverrir MagnússonHis open-air museum features several reconstructed turf homes — rustic stone and sod-roofed dwellings that Icelanders repeatedly rebuilt and reused for centuries.Residents and tourists “are often dumbfounded and fascinated” by the homes, Mr. Gudmundsson said, often finding it “hard to believe people used to survive here in these conditions.”During the concentrated period of development that began after World War II, thousands of turf homes were destroyed, according to Sigurjon Baldur Hafsteinsson, a professor of museum studies at the University of Iceland. This was not only to make way for modern buildings but also because Icelanders were embarrassed by the difference between Iceland and other European cultures with multiple layers of developmental history.“Today I would say that opinions of Icelanders are changing toward a more favorable appreciation,” Mr. Hafsteinsson said. Now, turf homes tell a story of the rugged resiliency of the nation’s Viking descendants.Pfahlbaumuseum UnteruhldingenThousands of years ago, people lived in wooden cabins perched above lakes in areas that are now Germany and Switzerland. Scientists believe that the homes were constructed on a foundation of wooden piles driven into the lake bed.The remnants of these lake homes and other artifacts from 4,000 to 850 B.C. are part of the five-acre, open-air Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen, also known as the Lake Dwelling Museum, on Germany’s Lake Constance. Twenty reconstructed lake homes depict life in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.ImageAt the Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen in Germany, there are remnants of lake homes and other artifacts from 4,000 to 850 B.C.Creditvia Pfahlbaumuseum UnteruhldingenA walk along the elevated footpath above the lake allows visitors to get a feel for life in this prehistoric community. In 2006, two German families got a chance to do more than use their imaginations: They were invited to move in for two months as part of the television series “Stone Age — The Experiment.”In an article addressing the educational value of the museum, Gunter Schöbel, the museum’s director, said, “Dry scientific data are not themselves appealing to the public.“A visitor these days is able to discriminate between an artificial theme park and the authenticity of an open-air museum that explains the present through the reality of the past.”Museum Meiji-muraWhile many of the 67 buildings on exhibit at the Museum Meiji-mura in Inuyama, Japan, are huge, the museum focuses on a narrow but important four-decade slice of history, beginning with the fall of the feudal shogun era. The museum’s focus is the evolution of Japan’s social, political and technological changes as seen through its architecture from 1868 to 1912.ImageAt the Museum Meiji-mura in Japan, inside the main gate is the Imperial Hotel, which is “a piece of architecture that symbolizes Japan’s modern era.”CreditMuseum MeijimuraThe most significant artifact, according to Souichirou Inouse, a spokesman for the museum, is the entrance hall and lobby of the Imperial Hotel, which opened in 1923 and was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.As Japan’s traditional wood structures gave way to stone and brick construction, the Imperial Hotel, made of concrete and lava stone, was defining Japan’s modern skyline. The hotel is “a piece of architecture that symbolizes Japan’s modern era,” Mr. Inouse said.The story of change demonstrated in factories, bridges, schools and even the 1907 gate of a prison is told alongside more humble structures like barbershops and bathhouses. Rumbling by all of this are Meiji-era electric streetcars from Kyoto that transport visitors on their day trip through Japan’s recent past."
5c9c134d49f0eacbf105f6e6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/business/boeing-737-max.html,"RENTON, Wash. — Boeing on Wednesday made its most overt acknowledgment that new software in its jets could have played a role in two deadly crashes as it tries to convince pilots, airlines and regulators around the world that a coming fix will solve the problem.Before a meeting with more than 200 pilots and airline executives at its factory in Renton, Wash., Boeing, for the first time, publicly laid out its proposed updates to the software as well other changes to the 737 Max that it hopes will get the plane flying again. The changes would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data, two issues at the center of the investigations into the crashes.“The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we’re making will address any of these accidents,” Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president for product strategy, said in a press briefing.Boeing 737 Max: What’s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.The company, which was eager to complete the plane quickly for competitive reasons, also faced new scrutiny in Washington on Wednesday over the development and certification of the jet, a process that regulators heavily delegated to Boeing. Senators, in two congressional hearings with Boeing’s regulators, pressed for more oversight and raised the possibility of overhauling the system.The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, said that the agency initially scrutinized the new software independently, but ultimately left it to Boeing. The official, Daniel Elwell, also said he did not believe the automated system had been tested with a scenario involving a faulty sensor, which was a concern in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]“The F.A.A. decided to do safety on the cheap, which is neither cheap nor safe,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. He added that he planned to introduce legislation to reform the system, which he said “is so fatally riddled with flaws.”ImageSenators convened a hearing on Wednesday with, from left, Daniel Elwell, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration; Robert L. Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board; and Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesThe F.A.A. “put the fox in charge of the henhouse,” he said.Boeing and the F.A.A. are playing defense on two fronts, as prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers investigate their responses to the crashes and their approval of the plane.During his hearing, Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, said he was looking into how the F.A.A. handled the crisis. In the days after an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people this month, global regulators grounded the jets, while the United States initially held off doing the same.“Clearly, confidence in F.A.A. as the gold standard for aviation safety has been shaken,” he said. Mr. Scovel said he wanted to understand why the agency was the last major aviation regulator in the world to “drive risk to zero” by grounding the 737 Max.Mr. Scovel also said he would investigate why the F.A.A. approved the software system, which is known as MCAS, including the decision not to include it in the operating instructions and not to require additional training for pilots. When the plane was introduced, pilots learned about the 737 Max on an iPad.Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also said in the hearing that his agency was “examining the U.S. design certification process.”The F.A.A. has long allowed plane makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. In recent years, Boeing was able to choose its own employees to help regulators approve the 737 Max.In a separate hearing with the Senate Appropriations Committee’s transportation subcommittee, the Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, called the practice “necessary.”ImageBoeing said it would retrofit its Max planes with a safety feature that had been optional.CreditRuth Fremson/The New York TimesMs. Chao stressed that the F.A.A. sets safety standards that manufacturers must meet while developing aircraft. The certification process, she said, “is, of course, subject to oversight and supervision by the F.A.A.”When asked by the subcommittee’s chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, about concerns that the arrangement “sacrifices potentially the safety of the traveling public,” Ms. Chao said that the possibility was “troubling.”Mr. Elwell, during his hearing, said that the F.A.A. initially oversaw certification for the software, but delegated more authority over time, “when we had the comfort level” that the Boeing employees were knowledgeable enough about the system.Mr. Elwell later said that practice was “part of the fabric of what we’ve used to become as safe as we are today” and that without it, the F.A.A. would need 10,000 more employees and $1.8 billion for its certification offices.Boeing has defended the process, saying the plane adhered to all F.A.A. safety rules.A Boeing official cautioned against drawing any definite conclusions until more is known. “In general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process,” this official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigations.The Boeing official said that in most accidents, many things go wrong. Based on what is known about the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing said it felt that MCAS was in need of updating.“We’ve seen two accidents now and we believe it is appropriate to make that link in the chain more robust,” the official said.ImageOutside the Boeing plant. The company provided no timetable for installing the new software, which still requires F.A.A. approval.CreditRuth Fremson/The New York TimesThe updated software, which Boeing outlined on Wednesday, will rely on data from two so-called angle of attack sensors, so the plane won’t have a single point of failure. It will also make it easier for pilots to override the system, which was originally designed to push down the nose of the plane repeatedly and aggressively.The company said the new software had been extensively tested and officials from the F.A.A. had taken test flights on updated jets. Pilots from United States airlines have also tried out the updated system in flight simulators.Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, has avoided the spotlight in recent weeks and was not in Renton on Wednesday for the news briefing or the meeting with pilots and executives.Boeing also said it would retrofit jets with a safety feature that was previously optional. The feature — known as a disagree light, which is activated if two key sensors on the plane do not produce the same readings — will be standard on new Max planes. The disagree light might have helped the pilots in the Lion Air crash identify the source of the problem.During a testy exchange, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, repeatedly pressed the F.A.A. official, Mr. Elwell, on whether all available safety features should be required on planes. Mr. Elwell responded that “safety-critical pieces of equipment on an aircraft are mandatory.” He added, “If there is any manufacturer that sells a safety-critical part a la carte, we will not permit it.”But Mr. Elwell added that he found it “hard to believe that a safety company like an airline would save a couple thousand dollars on an option that might improve safety.”Although the fix is apparently ready, Boeing provided no timetable for installing it. The F.A.A. must first approve the new software and the training. Then, Boeing said, each existing 737 Max will need to be manually upgraded, a procedure that takes an hour for each plane. Finally, Max pilots will need to receive an additional 30-minute training program about the software.Even if the F.A.A. does approve the changes, regulators in Europe, Canada, China, Brazil and elsewhere might move more slowly. “Certification around the world will be at the discretion of those regulators around the world, and so we can’t comment on timing,” Mr. Sinnett said."
5cb21d4449f0eacbf1f83c88,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/technology/apple-qualcomm-chips-smartphones.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Nasty legal battles are nothing new in the tech industry. But Apple’s conflict with the wireless chip maker Qualcomm, headed for a crucial court showdown this coming week, has a special intensity.The two companies, once partners of a sort, now disagree about nearly everything — including which one deserves the most credit for shaping the evolution of smartphones.Their formidable legal teams are at war on three continents, in a struggle that could affect the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits and, perhaps, even how much consumers pay for their phones.Now, the action moves to a federal courtroom in San Diego, where jury selection is set to begin on Monday for a trial on an Apple lawsuit and Qualcomm’s counterclaims. The chief executives of both companies are likely to take the stand.The stakes are reflected in the eye-popping damage claims. Four Asia-based contract manufacturers that assemble iPhones and iPads, whose suits have been merged with Apple’s, argue that they collectively overpaid Qualcomm roughly $9 billion in royalties over the years — a figure that could be tripled under antitrust laws to $27 billion.Apple says Qualcomm should also repay $3.1 billion associated with patents whose rights Apple says are exhausted. It has already won a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm should pay nearly $1 billion in withheld rebates.Qualcomm, in return, estimates that Apple’s partners — Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics — owe more than $7.5 billion in unpaid royalties. And it contends that Apple, which reimburses the manufacturers’ royalty payments, should be liable for a doubled penalty that would take the total to $15 billion or more.Qualcomm’s business practices have also attracted harsh scrutiny from regulators in multiple countries, including China and South Korea. A high-profile Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit is awaiting a judge’s verdict after a trial in San Jose, Calif.The world-spanning legal struggle between Apple and Qualcomm touches on two crucial issues for the tech industry: What is the proper balance between patent rights and competition? And what is the proper role of the government in regulating tech giants?“It’s a great deal more than just a legal case,” said Michael Wolf, who has tracked the issues for his management consulting firm Activate.The fight is an existential one for Qualcomm, at least as it has operated for most of its nearly 34 years in business. The company, based in San Diego, pioneered a type of cellular communications in the 1990s that later became a mainstay of mobile devices. That innovation allowed Qualcomm to charge patent royalties on nearly every smartphone sold, which generates the bulk of its profits.Qualcomm has historically charged about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a mobile phone. Because of Qualcomm’s various patents, companies building phones that would connect to cellular networks must pay that fee for every phone — even if the phone does not actually use Qualcomm chips.Phone makers have little leverage to negotiate for lower rates, the F.T.C. argued in its suit, which was filed in January 2017, that leans partly on Apple’s contentions.Because Qualcomm holds monopoly positions in two varieties of wireless chips, the F.T.C. argued, handset makers feared that Qualcomm could cut off shipments if they balked at paying royalties. Qualcomm insists it never used that tactic. Rival chip makers, denied patent licenses from Qualcomm, have fled the market while suppliers like Intel are struggling, the F.T.C. said.Apple, which sued Qualcomm shortly after the F.T.C.’s action, particularly objects to basing royalties on a phone’s total price. It says that formula means that Qualcomm earns more money as handset makers add innovations like displays, touch sensors and data storage unrelated to wireless technology.Qualcomm insists its business model has benefited consumers by helping to fund new innovations like the latest 5G wireless technology. It has responded with counterclaims that Apple and its manufacturing partners violated licensing contracts. Qualcomm has added a string of other court actions, including patent infringement suits against Apple in the United States, China and Germany.Qualcomm has so far persuaded courts in some countries, including China, to ban sales of some iPhones there, though Apple has dodged shipment disruptions, in part, by tweaking some of its software.The fight has also migrated to Washington. A little over a year ago, Qualcomm was spared a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom after the Trump administration blocked the deal on national security grounds. Qualcomm has raised the possibility that any court-ordered changes to its practices would threaten investments in wireless technologies that are critical to the American military and intelligence gathering. The chip maker also hired the opposition research firm Definers Public Affairs, which has distributed anti-Apple research to reporters.Many Qualcomm customers, partners and rivals are involved in the trial that starts on Monday. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive; Philip Schiller, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing; Qualcomm’s chief executive, Steven Mollenkopf, and its co-founder Irwin Jacobs could all be called to testify.One of the thorniest topics is whether Qualcomm’s royalty rates hurt consumers by raising smartphone prices. The F.T.C. contends they do, though it didn’t quantify the impact. Pricing is also at the heart of a separate private case against Qualcomm brought on behalf of smartphone purchasers, which seeks $5 billion in aggregate damages.ImageTim Cook, in Cupertino, Calif., last month. He is expected to testify in Apple’s lawsuit against the chip maker Qualcomm. The outcome could affect the division of billions of dollars of smartphone profits.CreditStephen Lam/ReutersQualcomm insists its royalties have negligible effect in the mobile market, because competition is sharply reducing prices on many phones and new features have simultaneously pushed flagship models above $1,000. It is appealing a judge’s ruling granting class-action status in the consumer case.“It’s much easier to show harm in a shrinking market,” said David Reichenberg, an antitrust attorney at Cozen O’Connor who specializes in tech cases. “It’s not easy here.”The 11-day trial in January in the F.T.C. case featured testimony by several Apple executives and numerous internal emails from the companies.Apple, which shied away from Qualcomm chips for the first iPhones, was facing the prospect in 2006 of paying $12 to $20 in royalties per handset, Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, testified at the trial. It wound up accepting a Qualcomm rebate that reduced the rate to $7.50 per device, as long as Apple agreed not to adopt a rival wireless technology, called WiMax, being promoted by Intel, he said.Apple began using Qualcomm chips for iPhones starting in 2011, after tense negotiations, Mr. Williams said. Apple managed to keep the $7.50 royalty rate as part of deals reached in 2011 and 2013, but the smartphone maker faced big financial penalties if it started using other chip suppliers.“We were staring at an increase of over a billion dollars a year on licensing,” Mr. Williams testified in connection with the 2013 deal. “We had a gun to our head.”Another Apple executive, Tony Blevins, testified that it began searching seriously for alternative suppliers in 2013. But Intel didn’t manage to win a share of Apple chip purchases until 2016.After legal hostilities began with Qualcomm the next year, Apple stopped paying patent royalties and Qualcomm stopped supplying chips for Apple’s newest iPhones — forcing Apple to ask Intel for a surprise increase in production, Mr. Williams said.Qualcomm has insisted that its royalty rates, rebates and exclusivity provisions are standard industry practices and had no effect on restricting competition.Companies like Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and Marvell have stopped selling wireless modem chips. But Qualcomm noted that Intel and MediaTek are major suppliers to phone makers, while Samsung and Huawei provide chips for their own phones.“The F.T.C. failed to show harm to competition,” Robert Van Nest, Qualcomm’s lead trial attorney, said in closing arguments at the trial. “The evidence is simply overwhelming that Qualcomm earned its position and success through superior innovation and better products.”"
5caf026c49f0eacbf1f82a10,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/well/family/montessori-home-playroom-makeover.html,"Our playroom was crammed with blinking and buzzing toys, neatly stored puzzles and games, shelves full of picture books, well-used baby dolls, dress-up costumes and artwork hanging on the walls. It seemed like paradise for our three young children.Until Simone Davies turned it upside down. Ms. Davies, a Montessori teacher in the Netherlands and author of “The Montessori Toddler,” spends her days teaching parents and children how to apply Montessori principles at home. Just as Marie Kondo is helping people declutter and organize, Ms. Davies helps parents turn homes into places that are more functional for the family, instill autonomy in the smallest members of the household and create a greater sense of peace — all in the Montessori spirit.She came to my New Jersey house a few weeks ago with the intention of showing me how to create a room that engaged my children rather than one that catered to my notions of what makes a good play space. I was skeptical: What could possibly be done that would make a noticeable improvement in our lives?Developed in the late 1800s by Dr. Maria Montessori, an Italian physician, the Montessori method used educational approaches to help children with emotional and mental disabilities. Today, it has become a widely accepted instructional system that aims to give any child more ownership of their learning. “In traditional education, the teacher stands in the front and leads the class,” said Ms. Davies. “In a child-led approach, we let them learn through play and their interests.”The goal in applying these principles at home? More autonomous and engaged children; less time spent helping children figure out what to do to fill their time.At home, “we support our children to make discoveries for themselves, we give them freedom and limits, and we enable success by setting up our homes so they can take part in our daily lives,” Ms. Davies writes.ImageThe playroom before had shelves lined with books and many toys that stayed out in the room at all times.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesImageAs part of the makeover, Ms. Davies cleared the bookshelves of most of its contents, including all of the books.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesIt was this latter part of the promise that most appealed to me: My kids would play without needing my intervention? It sounded great in theory. My husband and I have three kids, ages 7, 4 and 1, and we both commute to work for demanding jobs, with an au pair and grandparents in the mix. I had a place for everything but with so many different people in charge of the children, I often found it frustrating when things weren’t where they were “supposed to be.” But if the kids could handle the responsibilities of keeping a tidy playroom, maybe that frustration could be alleviated. But as Ms. Davies started pulling every toy out of my obsessively organized toy closet, a low-level panic set in.“What are your children’s favorite toys?” Ms. Davies asked.“Their iPad and Kindle,” I said, only pretending to be joking.She got to work. There was sorting to be done. (We found all the missing puzzle pieces!) The primary colors of our easel were painted over in a neutral gray to let the children’s artwork stand out. We removed large, distracting or noisy toys from the playroom floor in favor of more subdued wooden ones. We used furniture and toys we had, keeping the makeover budget modest.And the great reveal: a playroom that was unquestionably tidier, calmer and more inviting. Here are some of the changes that had the biggest impact.ImageThe new reading corner features a soft spot for curling up with a good book and a bookshelf free of clutter. CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe Reading CornerMy older children used to pull books from a crowded bookshelf, and frequently left them all over the house.Ms. Davies marked off a corner with an old, soft quilt on the floor, cozied up with unused throw pillows and a few favorite soft toys. Much to my surprise, she then removed all the books from the bookshelf, grouped them in the closet for each child and put out just a few in baskets. The bookshelf became a display space for small plants (which I had bought for $9 each), photos of my kids and a few of their favorite mementos.Without the array of books on the shelves, the corner felt calmer. “Kids feel more relaxed in a neutral room,” Ms. Davies said. So far, my daughters love their new Montessori-esque responsibility of watering the plants once a week. (We’ll see how long it lasts.)ImageLego was sorted from a large sack of thousands into a smaller bin with a smaller assortment of pieces.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesImageAfter the makeover, butterflies that were left in a tray participated in a private yoga class.CreditKaren BarrowTrays, Baskets and Bins“We childproof to put things out of reach of the child, so we should put the things we want them to play with in reach,” Ms. Davies said. She uses shallow bins and trays to display items rather than to hide them away.In addition to the book baskets, we now have two canvas bins (previously used in the closet for storage) on the floor for a few of my baby’s toys. One contains four soft balls, the other a few cars of varying sizes and types.“Only put out as much as you are willing to clean up,” Ms. Davies said. (“Can I leave them empty?” I asked.)On the shelves, small plastic trays ($3 each) featured different activities geared to the older kids: one for blocks, one with scissors, paper and stickers for crafts, and one filled with tiny plastic butterflies with toy binoculars.“Trays make it clear to your child what belongs together,” Ms. Davies said.When my older children got home from school on the day of the makeover, one went immediately to the craft tray and started snipping away, while the other set up a “butterfly yoga” scene with the nature-based tray.ImageAfter the makeover, the bulk of the clutter went into the closet, where it could be hidden. Lower shelves held individual baby toys to be inviting for little hands (and easy to clean up.)CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesLess Is MorePerhaps my favorite lesson: Kids play more when there’s less to play with.Instead of taking out all 300 pieces of the magnetic building toy I had kept in a giant sack, Ms. Davies placed about 20 pieces of varying shapes on a tray, and put the rest back into the closet. Instead of a tub of crayons being left on the table, a dozen were placed in a cup holder hung on the wall ($17 for four magnetic strips, $9 per magnetic cup).While rotating the toys on display does take some effort, it makes the playroom more interesting for the kids. Another benefit: because they aren’t playing with 100 tiny pieces of anything any more, there is much less to clean up at any one time, and the older kids can and do handle it themselves.“Kids don’t need as much as we think they do,” Ms. Davies said. “They get more creative when there’s less.”Ms. Davies prefers simple, wooden or plainer-looking toys that have one clear purpose — roll cars down a track, place coins in a slot, push a button for music — over brightly colored, blinking, noisy toys I won’t miss. We’ll be happily giving those away soon.ImageA more autonomous 1-year-old takes pleasure in his new play corner. CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesSpaces With a PurposeMy 1-year-old immediately fell in love with the little nook that was set aside for him, containing one simple toddler toy per shelf, within reach of his little arms. (Ms. Davies had lowered art to be at kid level; it had to be moved back up because of those little arms — and grabby hands.) The 4-year-old loved that I was suddenly leaving out scissors and glue for her to use at will since the tray they were in contained any mess and made it clear what she was allowed to cut and make sticky.I was a little skeptical about the Montessori approach at first but in practice I can see a certain logic to it, and may even add Montessori-based concepts to other areas. Ms. Davis suggested a chart listing the morning routine with words and images to help the children get ready with less help. A small dust pan and broom in the kitchen would allow the children to clean up after mealtimes. Will they use it? Like the rest of this experiment, it can’t hurt to try.In the end, I’ve taken away a few pretty big lessons from the experience. My kids can handle more than I think they can, if I set them up for success. They don’t need nearly as many toys, books and games as the commercials, grandparents and their whining would have you believe. And, I’m pretty sure no makeover, no matter how big, will completely redirect the pull from screens. At least now, when it’s time to put the tablet down, there’s an activity set up and waiting for their growing minds. "

Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, discussed the tech she’s using.What are your most important tech tools for tracking budgets?This may sound strange coming from a personal finance reporter, but I’m not a big fan of traditional budgets — I don’t think they work. I try to keep my own spending in check by taking the reverse approach. Instead of tracking every dollar, I focus on what we need to save for: retirement, college or some other goal. After you’ve automated your savings goals and created a bit of a cushion for emergencies, you’re freer to spend without thinking too hard or feeling too guilty. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s better than a failed budget. That method won’t necessarily work in all situations, especially if you need to tackle debt or establish a stricter spending plan in retirement. And everyone can benefit from tracking personal spending, even if you do it only for a few months or check in only every quarter.Mint has been around for a while, but it is still a solid way to take stock of where all of your money is going and whether your net worth is moving in the right direction. It also allows you to create a budget, and alerts you when you’ve spent too much. I use it infrequently, and there’s usually at least one kink I need to work out whenever I log in; most recently, it counted all of my retirement accounts twice, which was kind of cruel. Personal Capital, an investment advisory service, also has a robust free tool that tracks your spending, cash flow and retirement goals all in one place with minimal effort.For people who want a more proactive approach to spending and whittling down debt, there’s You Need a Budget. I’ve come across many people in my reporting who have attested that it’s life-changing.Which basic tools would you recommend for people to increase their savings and investments?It’s not so much a tool but a technology: automation. After you’ve settled on a low-cost investment provider such as Vanguard, automation is the surest way to set yourself up for success. Automate as much as you can — your Roth I.R.A. contributions, your kids’ 529 college savings accounts. If you have an employer-provided retirement plan like a 401(k), see if it will allow you to automatically increase the percentage you’re saving each year. If not, set a date in your electronic calendar to remind you to revisit all of those amounts annually.I also like the little revolution that the roboadvisers have started. They lean heavily on technology to help invest and manage your money, though more of them are increasingly integrating human advisers. Betterment and Wealthfront have free tools that will let you play with various goals and savings amounts to see how long it will take you to save what you need. What money apps do you recommend for the younger set?I have a 2-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, who recently started asking me questions about how credit cards work and how much money we earn. Another day, we were in a bookstore and he wanted me to buy four new Dog Man and Captain Underpants books. All of this happened within a couple of weeks, so I took that as a cue. ImageThe simplicity of the PiggyBot app for her 6-year-old son appealed to Ms. Siegel Bernard.CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesThere are a ton of money apps for children and teenagers, but I was hoping to find something to help him focus on developing patience and delaying gratification. Today, bags of groceries magically appear on our doorstep without any visible transaction. If we need something, we can just press a button — as adults, we’re a month removed from any consequences, and children are often completely unaware that there was any exchange at all. Stuff just arrives when you want it.To help acquaint my son with the reality of how all of this works, I decided to pay him an allowance of $5 a week. Instead of putting it in physical “save, spend and give” jars, he’s tracking the same categories on an iPad. I scanned a few different apps, but the simplicity of PiggyBot seemed well suited for younger children. He immediately set a goal to buy two of those books — but he’s going to have to wait nine weeks to get them. (I also told him that we could just go to the library.)Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? I live a pretty low-tech life. We listen to music through Sonos and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device, though we haven’t entirely cut the cord because my husband is a soccer fan. I did recently learn that we can hand in our cable box and pay a little less, while keeping access to cable channels through Roku, though you lose the ability to record.There are also several apps that I use daily or weekly. I always have roughly five dozen tabs open on my computer screen, as well as stories I come across on Twitter that I want to read later. To minimize the clutter, I save everything to the Pocket app, which I’ll read on my commute. I also keep a to-do list on the iPhone “reminders” app.I also love Ink and Postagram for turning my children’s photos into cards for relatives, all from my aging iPhone 6s, which has started to shut down in the cold. I have a long wish list of apps, but I really want more sophisticated tools that would help us become smarter consumers. I want to enter a product name into an app so it can assure me that we’re not feeding our children weed killer in their oatmeal.Image“I live a pretty low-tech life,” Ms. Siegel Bernard said. “We listen to music through Sonos ...CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesImage... and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device.”CreditLisa Weatherbee for The New York TimesLots of web writers talk about the so-called FIRE, which stands for “financial independence, retire early.” People are retiring as early as their 30s. What do you think about this movement?We can all learn something from folks like Mr. Money Mustache, who is credited with popularizing the idea of hyper-frugal, anti-consumerist living and saving a significant chunk of your salary so you can either retire early or pursue more rewarding work. But the movement started with a lot of technology workers — and it’s a lot easier to save half your salary when you’re a well-paid software engineer with health insurance and no debt. Sure, these folks had to exercise discipline and restraint. But they had the luxury of exercising that discipline; there are so many people living on much less and struggling to pay for health insurance, rent, child care and student loans or to keep full-time jobs with chronic conditions. It also raises a lot of questions: How do they pay for health care? Will the money really last as long as they need it? A lot of research shows a portfolio may last around 30 years if you withdraw 4 percent of the initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjust that dollar amount for inflation annually. So when you start looking at longer time horizons — or a 50-year or 60-year retirement — it’s increasingly possible to run out of money if you don’t make adjustments.  But it’s easy to see why so many people find the movement intriguing and why it has become such a popular story line. You can’t help but wonder what it took to achieve financial security so early, so you click and hope to learn something. "
5c3c5da43a125f5075c0441e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/well/family/taking-the-pain-out-of-childrens-shots.html,"“If you ask every single child in the United States, what are you most afraid of going to the pediatrician, the answer is needle pokes,” said Dr. Stefan Friedrichsdorf, the medical director of pain medicine and palliative care at Children’s Minnesota.The pain and fear around childhood vaccinations, he said, contributes to the development of needle phobias, which can make people reluctant to get flu shots and other potentially lifesaving vaccines. Thus, pediatric pain specialists hope that reducing or eliminating the pain associated with needles can potentially reduce what we now call vaccine hesitancy, encouraging parents to get those annual flu shots for themselves and their children, and generally taking away some of the fear that can get in the way of ideal health care.“We now have noticed that since we started doing this, it’s a life changing event, kids are less and less likely to be needle phobic,” Dr. Friedrichsdorf said. “We are trying to prove it’s lifesaving.” Through an initiative called the Comfort Promise at Children’s Minnesota, the entire hospital has committed to reducing or eliminating needle pain, along with other types of pain.So how do you eliminate, or at least substantially reduce, the pain of vaccination or blood draws? Parents should make sure that their children’s pediatrician or hospital always offers the four elements of the Comfort Promise, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said.Numb the skin.Topical anesthesia, in the form of lidocaine cream, is available over the counter and safe even for infants, he said; it should be applied at least 30 minutes before the shot or the blood draw. At Children’s Minnesota, he said, it is offered to “every single child every single time,” which involves a great deal of planning and coordination. “It’s doable but it’s a lot of hard work,” he said.Let infants breast-feed.Offer breast-feeding or a pacifier dipped in sugar water for infants under 12 months old when they are getting shots or blood draws. The effect, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, is “spectacular.” A systematic review has shown that in infants, breast-feeding is more effective than topical anesthetics, said Christine Chambers, a professor and children’s pain researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Don’t pin a child down.Children should never be held down, which is frightening in itself; instead, put the child in an upright position on a parent’s lap. “In our hospital, it’s illegal to hold children down,” Dr. Friedrichsdorf said. “Unfortunately, all over America people are adhering to the old idea of just pin them down.” When I was in training, we routinely restrained children when they needed stitches or other minor — and painful — procedures by velcroing them into what we called “papoose boards.” Very rarely, a child will need to be held down for emergency lifesaving procedures, when there is no time to lose. But in the vast majority of cases, with pain control and distraction for the child, that kind of restraint should be unnecessary. “Papoose boards should be illegal, they don’t make any sense,” Dr. Friedrichsdorf said.Provide distraction.Provide age-appropriate distraction with anything from a parent's phone or iPad to blowing bubbles. The kinds of statements that parents make about pain and needles can have a big impact on children, said Dr. Chambers. Research has shown, she said, that what parents may intend as reassuring statements about how it will be over soon, or it won’t hurt too much, are perceived as a signal of parent anxiety and can actually make kids feel worse and increase their pain. Instead, parents should “use distracting statements, or give suggestions about how kids can cope, like taking a deep breath,” she said.If these measures are not enough for some procedures, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, “the answer is nitrous gas” and, rarely, when necessary, forms of deeper sedation.[Sign up for the Well Family newsletter.]Dr. Chambers leads the “It Doesn’t Have to Hurt” initiative in Canada, which provides parents with evidence about children’s pain control so they can advocate for their children. An article she wrote in September in the journal Pain Reports summarizes developments in the field of pediatric pain research.She told a story of one mother who took her baby to the emergency department and asked if she could breast-feed while the baby was having a procedure done. The initial response was no; “there’s a lot of misconceptions, the baby will associate pain with feeding, or the baby will choke,” Dr. Chambers said. But the mother persisted and finally prevailed, and “eventually the resident said, go ahead, and then said, this was one of the best procedures I’ve ever done.”Pediatric pain specialists speak with real passion about their ability to shield kids from even the “routine” pain of shots and blood draws. But they acknowledge that change in medical practice can be slow, and that parents are their most important partners in advocacy. “Simply asking the question, ‘What can be done to manage my child’s pain,’ just bringing that possibility up,” often starts doctors and nurses thinking about better pain management, Dr. Chambers said.And of course, children are not the only ones out there who are frightened. “We don’t talk about how many adults are afraid of needles or avoid getting needles,” Dr. Chambers said. “We’ve had many parents in our initiative say, these strategies have worked not only for my kids but for me.”So what gets in the way? Dr. Friedrichsdorf points out that veterinary medicine requires much more training in how to handle pain “before you can operate on a hamster” than is required of pediatricians and even of surgeons. And the logistics of providing this kind of pain management for routine shots and blood draws can be very daunting for institutions or busy practices: all those topical anesthetics to be applied, all those distraction techniques to be taught and practiced.An international initiative, ChildKind, certifies hospitals that meet standards for pediatric pain control, attempting to build in both standards and a strong incentive for the best evidence-based practices. And Minnesota is working with five other children’s hospitals in the United States and Canada to replicate its comfort promise initiative, while others are implementing these changes independently.Parents can also take the initiative, learning about the evidence, bringing the information to their children’s health care providers, and partnering in everything from applying the topical cream to providing the distracting conversation or device or even bubbles, to holding doctors to a high standard for their children’s sake. Dr. Friedrichsdorf said that after working in pain management for nearly 20 years, he recognizes that his message gets through most effectively when parents demand good pain control for their children. He added: “I hope parents never accept no as an answer.”This is the second column in a series on children’s pain. The first is on pain after surgery."
5ca9a01249f0eacbf1f8168b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/us/trash-pickers-san-francisco-zuckerberg.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Three blocks from Mark Zuckerberg’s $10 million Tudor home in San Francisco, Jake Orta lives in a small, single-window studio apartment filled with trash.There’s a child’s pink bicycle helmet that Mr. Orta dug out from the garbage bin across the street from Mr. Zuckerberg’s house. And a vacuum cleaner, a hair dryer, a coffee machine — all in working condition — and a pile of clothes that he carried home in a Whole Foods paper bag retrieved from Mr. Zuckerberg’s bin.A military veteran who fell into homelessness and now lives in government subsidized housing, Mr. Orta is a full-time trash picker, part of an underground economy in San Francisco of people who work the sidewalks in front of multimillion-dollar homes, rummaging for things they can sell.Trash picking is a profession more often associated with shantytowns and favelas than a city at the doorstep of Silicon Valley. The Global Alliance of Waste Pickers, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, counts more than 400 trash picking organizations across the globe, almost all of them in Latin America, Africa and southern Asia.But trash scavengers exist in many United States cities and, like the rampant homelessness in San Francisco, are a signpost of the extremes of American capitalism. A snapshot from 2019: One of the world’s richest men and a trash picker, living a few minutes’ walk from each other.Mr. Orta, 56, sees himself as more of a treasure hunter.“It just amazes me what people throw away,” he said one night, as he found a pair of gently used designer jeans, a new black cotton jacket, gray Nike running sneakers and a bicycle pump. “You never know what you will find.”Mr. Orta says his goal is to earn around $30 to $40 a day from his discoveries, a survival income of around $300 a week.ImageMr. Orta is part of an underground economy of people who work the sidewalks in front of multimillion-dollar homes, rummaging for things they can sell.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesTrash picking is illegal in California — once a bin is rolled out onto the sidewalk the contents are considered the possession of the trash collection company, according to Robert Reed, a spokesman for Recology, the company contracted to collect San Francisco’s garbage. But the law is rarely enforced.Mr. Orta was born in San Antonio, Tex., one of 12 children. He spent more than a dozen years in the Air Force, loading aircraft during the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and was dispatched to Germany, Korea and Saudi Arabia. By the time he returned to the United States, his wife had left him, and he struggled with alcoholism and homelessness. He moved to San Francisco, and five years ago qualified for a program assisting chronically homeless veterans.At dusk he leaves his apartment building, which is wedged between a popular brunch spot for tech workers and a cannabis shop in the heart of the Mission neighborhood. The smell of marijuana fills the vestibule. Walking up a steep hill lined with mature trees, he passes homes that could pass for works of art: Victorians, some with stained glass and elaborate cornices and moldings painted in a soft palette of pastels, ocher, celadon and teal. A virtual tour of the neighborhood on the Zillow site shows that homes valued at $3 million and above are the norm.But Mr. Orta doesn’t look at the architecture. He walks the streets, slightly stooped, his eyes on the ground and a flashlight in his back pocket. His friends call him the Finder.On the six times Mr. Orta went out with a reporter, he followed a variety of circuits, but usually ended up exploring his favorite alleys and a dumpster that has been bountiful. (The first rule of dumpster scavenging, he said, is to make sure there’s no raccoon or possum in there.) In March, the dumpster yielded a box of silver goblets, dishes and plates, as if someone had yanked a tablecloth from underneath a feast in some European chateau.“How do you say it?” William Washington, one of Mr. Orta’s trash-picking colleagues, remarked one night. “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.”Mr. Orta’s other recent discoveries: phones, iPads, three wristwatches and bags of marijuana. (“I smoked it,” he said when asked how much he got for the pot.) In late August or September, as participants return from the annual Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, Mr. Orta says he often finds abandoned bicycles covered in fine sand.ImageMr. Orta, right, selling some of the items he found. His goal is to earn around $30 to $40 a day from his discoveries.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesMr. Orta says he only takes what people have clearly thrown away, although 14 years ago he spent a few months in jail for breaking into someone’s garage in Sacramento and trying to steal a wrench for his bicycle. “It was a dumb mistake,” he said.For years San Francisco has been a global beacon of recycling, attracting a stream of government ministers, journalists and students from across the globe to study the sorting facilities of Recology.But the city is also full of young, affluent people preoccupied with demanding jobs and long commutes for whom the garbage can is a tempting way to get rid of that extra pair of jeans or old electronics cluttering their closet.“We have a lot of trash of convenience,” said Mr. Reed, the spokesman for Recology. “You’ve got more and more tech people here and this city is moving faster and faster. These people have short attention spans. Some discard items that ought to be repurposed through a thrift shop.”Trash pickers fall into several broad categories. For decades, elderly women and men have collected cardboard, paper, cans or bottles, lugging impossibly large bags around the city and bringing them to recycling centers for cash.The city is most concerned about the battered pickup trucks, known as mosquito fleets, that buzz around San Francisco collecting recyclables on an industrial scale, depriving Recology, and ultimately the city, of income, said Bill Barnes, a spokesman for the city administrator’s office.“That’s a significant challenge for residents because it results in higher garbage rates,” Mr. Barnes said.Image“It just amazes me what people throw away,” Mr. Orta said.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesTrash pickers like Mr. Orta are in yet another category, targeting items in the black landfill garbage bins whose contents would otherwise go to what’s known as the pit — a hole in the ground on the outskirts of the city that resembles a giant swimming pool, where trash is crushed and compacted by a huge bulldozer and then carried by a fleet of trucks to a dump an hour and a half away. The city exports about 50 large truckloads a day.Nick Marzano, an Australian photographer who publishes a glossy magazine, Mission Gold, which documents the world of trash pickers in San Francisco, estimates there are several hundred garbage scavengers in the city.“It’s a civic service as I see it,” Mr. Marzano said. “Rather than this stuff going to landfill the items are being reused.”Mr. Marzano says there is overlap among trash picking and homelessness and public drug use — the street conditions that have ranked at the top of residents’ concerns for several years. But he sees trash picking, and the spontaneous sidewalk markets that pop up in neighborhoods like the Mission and Tenderloin, as a form of entrepreneurship.“It’s the primary form of income for people who have no other income,” he said.Mr. Orta sells what he retrieves at impromptu markets on Mission Street or at a more formal market on Saturdays on Julian Avenue. Children’s toys very rarely sell — parents don’t like the idea that they have come from the trash. Women’s clothing is iffy. But men don’t seem to care as much where the clothing came from, and jeans are easy to hawk for $5 or $10 a pair.Mr. Orta’s favorite item retrieved from the trash is one that he will not sell: a collection of newspapers from around the world documenting the course of World War II. He wonders why anyone would have thrown that away.On a recent Tuesday evening — the eve of trash collection in Mr. Zuckerberg’s neighborhood — Mr. Orta didn’t find anything worth keeping in the Facebook founder’s two garbage cans. Mr. Zuckerberg has at least one other home in the San Francisco Bay Area; this one he bought in November 2012 for $9,999,000 through a company he controls.In the blue recycling bin marked with Mr. Zuckerberg’s address, there were A&W diet root beer cans, cardboard boxes and a junk mail credit card offer. In the black landfill bin were remnants of a chicken dinner, a stale baguette and Chinese takeout containers.Mr. Orta pulled apart a garbage bag in the black bin.“Just junk — nothing in there.”"
5c2d35393a125f5075c0296d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing of China’s economy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.Apple’s surprise announcement was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble. Beijing’s effort last spring to clamp down on credit, which sparked a slowdown, and an intensifying trade war with the United States have unnerved consumers and businesspeople alike.“Apple is a bellwether,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren’t buying it, then that’s a pretty good sign they’re having a hard time.”It is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China’s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market’s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.With more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China — or have as much to lose. China is Apple’s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company’s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.“While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,” Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.”Apple’s revenue warnings sent its shares down more than 7 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening, dropping its market value to less than $700 billion. Apple had become the first company to surpass a $1 trillion valuation in August.Its declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple’s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.[See how investors reacted to Apple’s news.]Mr. Cook has for years navigated the difficult politics of China, including its tightening controls over the internet, but the Trump administration’s tougher stance on the country is posing a challenge.The iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple’s profits.The company’s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.While Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.Huawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.Finding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple’s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.Many expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.Car sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.Unsold apartments are clogging the country’s real estate market and eroding prices. That is a big threat to China’s economic growth in the new year because the frenzied construction and outfitting of new homes has accounted for a quarter or more of economic output in recent years, outshining even exports.There are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.“The worst is yet to come,” Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.The Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.But tensions continue to grow. Canada’s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company’s founder.The Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.“If people aren’t buying iPhones, they’re probably not buying everything else,” Mr. Zandi said. “It symbolizes how deep China’s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.”"

Apple and Google seem to agree, which is why both companies have added tools to their phones to help you track and control your phone addiction. Do self-imposed limits really work, though? If you use them right, then they can help break your bad habits.Apple’s feature, called Screen Time, was introduced in iOS 12. Screen Time allows you to monitor how much time you spend using your device and what you’re doing with it. Google has a similar feature for Android devices called Digital Wellbeing that not only charts what you do and for how long, but also packs extra features like turning the screen gray at night to remind you to put your phone down, or it even outright disables apps after a set time.These can be used as part of a parental control system, but they’re also designed to help limit your own screen time. You can find out where you’re sinking your time, decide how much you want to limit your phone usage and enforce rules on yourself. However, since you control those limits, are they really limits, or just mild suggestions from your past self? These tools won’t change your habits for you, but you can use them to help yourself.Examine how you spend your phone time, not just how muchConventional wisdom says that you probably need to put your phone down more than you do. However, one study from researchers at the University of Melbourne suggests that it’s not just how much time you spend on your phone that matters as it is what you’re doing with it. If the time you spend on your phone is meaningful, then it’s not time wasted. In other words, chatting with a loved one or reading a book on your phone would naturally make you happier than arguing on Facebook or reading news that makes you angry.From this perspective, Apple and Google’s tools become a lot more useful. The first component of iOS’s Screen Time is a time tracker. In your device’s settings you can find a chart that shows you when you’re using your device most, how many times you pick up your device and which apps you’re using most. It also shows you how many notifications you get from each app, so you can find out which apps are interrupting you during the day the most.Google’s suite works similarly. Open the Digital Wellbeing section of your phone’s settings — Google’s own Pixel phones have it, but other devices may get it when they receive the Android Pie update — and you’ll be greeted with a circular chart that shows which apps take up the most of your time. You can also explore charts that show what time of day you spend in apps, how many notifications you get and when you’re getting them, and even how much time you spend on each app every day.This glut of information from both platforms has one main purpose: showing you exactly how you spend your time on your phone. Before you start setting up blocks to limit your screen time, take a look at your usage habits and ask yourself what you’re getting out of the apps you spend the most time with. If you’re spending an hour a day on an app that you don’t even enjoy, that realization alone might be enough to break your habit.I Used Apple’s New Controls to Limit a Teenager’s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)July 11, 2018Set limits to nudge — not to control — yourselfOnce you’ve discovered the apps you spend the most time in, you might want to set some limits for yourself. After all, if it were easy to break your Instagram addiction, you would’ve done it by now, right? Apple and Google both give you more tools to do that, however, it’s better to interpret them as helpful nudges, rather than hard blocks.Apple even treats their limits this way. When you set a time limit on an app in Screen Time, your iPhone or iPad will let you use the app uninterrupted until you pass that limit. Afterwards, no matter what you’re doing in the app, you’ll be hit with a full screen warning that you’ve used up your time. However, you can choose to give yourself another fifteen minutes, or even ignore the limit altogether.This approach makes sense. Most of the time you probably want to observe the self-imposed limit, but there may be a time when you just need a few minutes. Hitting the snooze button lets you keep your limit in place while still giving you some flexibility.Google, on the other hand, takes a more hardline approach. When you set an app timer, that’s all the time you get. If you give yourself an hour a day to use Twitter, as soon as you hit your 61st minute, the app will lock down. The icon on your home screen will be grayed out, and if you try to open it, your phone will tell you that you can’t. If you want to use it anyway, you’ll have to disable the timer altogether.In both cases, you can get around an app block if you really want to. However, it can still be helpful to keep those timers on, if only as a reminder of how long you’ve spent in an app. When even the bartender tells you that you’ve had enough, it’s a pretty strong sign that you need to stop. In the same way, if your phone is telling you to put the phone down, you can get around the limits you set for yourself, but at least you no longer have the excuse that you lost track of time.Nightly wind down routines are the secret weaponWhether you spend too much time on your phone during the day may be subjective, but study after study suggests that you should at least put your phone down at night. This is where Apple and Google’s software really shines. Both platforms allow you to set quiet hours. During these hours you can still use your phone, but you might get fewer notifications, or a stronger nudge to put it down.Apple’s Downtime feature allows you to set a few apps that can always be used — like your phone or text messaging app — but block all of the others. This “block” is the same sort of soft-block we’ve mentioned, where you can still get around them. However, blocked apps will be darkened on your home screen. When almost every app is grayed out and nags you to put your phone down when you try to use them, it’s probably time to just get ready for bed.Google’s Wind Down feature is even more clever. For starters, it will put your phone in Do Not Disturb mode, which you can separately configure it to block all but the most important calls and messages. Unfortunately, Google doesn’t allow you to blanket disable most of your apps like iOS does, but you can at least stop getting notifications.More importantly, Wind Down includes a feature called Grayscale. In this mode, all the color is drained from your phone’s screen. This is separate from Night Light, which adjusts your phone’s color temperature to a warmer orange light so it’s less harsh. Grayscale, on the other hand, turns your phone into a black-and-white TV show. At the best of times, this is mildly annoying, but it can make some tasks — like watching a video or playing a game — near impossible. Of all the features on both platforms, this is the strongest nudge to put your phone down that’s not actively disruptive. You can still use your phone in Grayscale mode, but it’s not nearly as fun.Both platforms reserve their harshest punishments for night time phone use. Arguably, this is when you would need those prompts the most. Using your phone in bed or late into the night can disrupt your sleep schedule or lead to restless sleep that follows you the next day.

Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]They showed up in dress shoes and button downs, cowboy boots and bluejeans, flip-flops and khaki shorts. Some worked in retail, others in food service, and several had served in the military.More than 150 men and women — mostly Hispanic, and including a few couples — turned up on Saturday at the Border Patrol’s headquarters in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, looking for a chance to help with the nation’s border security. They talked to recruiters and signed up on iPads, welcomed by pop-country music and two mustang patrol horses.It was Job Fair day in the busiest Border Patrol sector in the United States.The Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, have come in for widespread criticism for implementing some of President Trump’s harshest immigration policies: curtailing the number of asylum-seekers processed each day at the border and, last year, separating families. But that is not the dominant local narrative.Working in the Border Patrol has been a bedrock middle-class job for generations of Mexican-American families, much the way police departments served as a gateway to a respectable future for generations of immigrants in the Northeast.“It’s basically the go-to job in the valley,” said Andrew Canales, 22, who was born and raised in the region.“It pays well,” said his girlfriend, Savannah Reyna, 19.Since taking office, President Trump has sought to harden the southern border with more fencing and more law enforcement. The president signed an executive order calling for the hiring of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents, but the agency has had serious problems recruiting and retaining agents, especially on remote sections of the 1,900-mile border with Mexico.The hiring process can take nearly a year, slowed by lengthy background checks and polygraph examinations that prompt many applicants to look elsewhere.The Border Patrol presently has about 19,500 agents, some 1,800 fewer than Congress has provided funds for. Though the agency lost almost twice as many agents in recent years as it hired, it managed to achieve a net increase of 118 agents in the latest fiscal year.Those figures are still far from the Mr. Trump’s goals. So the Border Patrol has beefed up recruiting efforts across the country, and perhaps nowhere more than in South Texas, where it has been conducting a broad marketing campaign.ImageThe Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, are seen in the valley as an important source of secure jobs with good pay and benefits, despite criticism over some of the policies the agencies implement.CreditEve Edelheit for The New York TimesHiring advertisements appear on Instagram and Twitter, and the agency has invested heavily in cultivating relationships. Last week, at a “Head of the Class” ceremony at a local performing arts center, the agency honored high school seniors who “demonstrate exemplary character and determination to succeed.” It was not a recruiting event, and many of the students were not planning to pursue law-enforcement careers. But the Border Patrol was signaling its role as a member of the larger valley community, much the way local grocery-store chains and banks do.Earlier this year, the newly arrived sector chief for the Rio Grande Valley, Rodolfo Karisch, held a “State of the Border” presentation and meet-and-greet to update lawmakers and the public about the agency’s efforts.The Rio Grande Valley remains at the leading edge of unauthorized border crossings in the United States, with more than 78,900 members of families and 42,300 single adults apprehended since Oct. 1.In the valley, where the average household income is just $37,000, the federal border agency has become an important driver of an economy that also depends heavily on trade with Mexico, along with agriculture and tourism.“If you have 3,000 Border Patrol agents here in South Texas, you’re going to have at least 2,500 homes purchased, and probably 5,000 vehicles,” said Rick Cavazos, a retired Border Patrol agent who is now the mayor of the border town of Los Indios, Tex. “Kids are in schools. Some of these government jobs are six-figure jobs. Economically, those are some of the things that I wish people would look at.”The agency has been a source of opportunity for Mexican-Americans in particular. A little more than half of all Border Patrol agents are Hispanic, and in the Rio Grande Valley, the proportion is even higher, agency officials say.More than 150 men and women visited the Border Patrol’s Valley headquarters in just five hours on Saturday. Not all applied for jobs, but many did — despite a week of upheaval in Washington, where the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Border Patrol, has lost its cabinet secretary and several other top officials to firings and resignations.One notable departure was Ronald D. Vitiello, who more than a decade ago was the chief patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Mr. Trump withdrew Mr. Vitiello’s nomination to be director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for immigration enforcement away from the border. Mr. Trump said he wanted to go in a “tougher” direction.The robust turnout on Saturday appeared to be a sign that the Border Patrol has stable support in the largely Democratic front-line communities most affected by a recent surge in migration from Central America, even though the agency’s stepped-up security response has drawn criticism around the country and in some quarters locally as well.Tucked between a minor-league basketball arena and a Buick-GMC car dealership, the agency’s headquarters saw a stream of applicants throughout the day.Michael Giambra, a slight Venezuelan-born 19-year-old who lives in Edinburg, said he made $8 an hour running the drive-through window at Whataburger — or Whisky Bravo, as many agents call it. A veteran recruiter for the agency, Maria Guerrero, frequents the fast-food joint, and had been chatting with Mr. Giambra for months. During her late-evening dinner run on Friday, she invited him to the job fair, and to her surprise, he showed up the next morning.“I know that Border Patrol before was a really high standard — it was a good job, people that secure our country,” Mr. Giambra said after submitting his application. “Now it’s been beaten up for the same reason. Because of politics.”ImageMichael Giambra, 19, speaking with a Border Patrol agent, Maria Guerrero, during a Border Patrol recruitment event on Saturday.CreditEve Edelheit for The New York TimesMs. Guerrero, who apparently had recruited several of the people who applied on Saturday, said that interest in joining the agency had heightened lately. But she said she was unsure whether the trend was a response to the polarizing politics surrounding the border and immigration.Jason Castro, 19, said that his mother encouraged him to attend the job fair after she saw Ms. Guerrero’s recruitment post on Facebook. Mr. Castro, who works in retail at Old Navy, said many of his relatives have worked in law enforcement and that he wanted to do the same.He might have found it uncomfortable to talk about joining the Border Patrol with some of his left-leaning friends in South Texas, a region that votes firmly for Democrats. “But everyone’s supportive, a couple friends texted me ‘good luck’ earlier, and that kind of stuff,” he said. “And not all my friends even like the Border Patrol.”Ms. Guerrero helped guide Mr. Castro through his application, handing him the appropriate documents and introducing him to other agents. As he left, she hugged him and planted a kiss on his cheek, a common greeting in South Texas.Morale across the agency has taken a nose-dive over the last several months, agents have said, complaining about a lack of resources to handle large numbers of migrants and the instability of the agency’s leadership in Washington.“A lot of guys feel they get beat up in the public,” said Christopher Cabrera, a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the valley. “They worry about what’s being said about them. I think most guys, they just kind of brush it off. I think the families of our agents feel beaten up, because people are attacking their loved ones.”Adrian Garza, a McAllen native who showed up at the job fair wearing a black suit, said he had served in the National Guard for the last four years and had always wanted to work in law enforcement.“I wouldn’t want anything other than this,” Mr. Garza said.The steps to receiving a badge and taking an oath can often take months, and sometimes nearly a year, including a long period at the Border Patrol Academy in New Mexico. Then there are exams and further training in the field along the border. Mr. Giambra said he believes he can pass — with the right studying.Mr. Giambra admits that he doesn’t understand the nuances of asylum law, as the Border Patrol’s workload changes from arresting and deporting people who enter the country illegally to dealing with the growing number of migrants arriving to seek protection from persecution in their homelands.“I’m not 100 percent sure on that,” Mr. Giambra said when discussing the growing number of asylum cases. “I want to study the laws, but I don’t know right now.”Of the post-academy tests, one recruiter said, the one that prospective agents often struggle with the most is the immigration law exam. But Mr. Giambra figures that he has time to master that, too. In any case, for a job with a future, he is ready to try.“You’re working for the federal government,” he said. “You’re not working for, like, Whataburger.”"

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know attheplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.Radiohead, ‘Ill Wind’“Ill Wind” was a postscript to Radiohead’s 2016 album, “A Moon Shaped Pool,” released on a bonus disc but not, until now, to streaming services. Its very few lyrics counsel isolation and detachment for fear of provoking that “ill wind.” They’re set to one of Radiohead’s morose bossa novas, at first akin to “Knives Out”: a nest of minor-key counterpoint on guitar and bass. But then more layers arrive, fluty sounds and buzzy ones, swallowing the song before prettily fading out. What seemed like a sanctuary was a trap. JON PARELESKhalid featuring Kane Brown, ‘Saturday Nights Remix’Halsey featuring Juice WRLD, ‘Without Me’More seemingly left field but in fact totally harmonious cross-genre collaborations in 2019, please. The young country star Kane Brown brings adds an earthy sincerity to Khalid’s soothing delivery of angst on this remix of “Saturday Nights,” and Juice WRLD drizzles his melodically sweet melancholy on Halsey’s impressively stern scold “Without Me.” JON CARAMANICAAdia Victoria, ‘Different Kind of Love’Adia Victoria, a songwriter from South Carolina who’s now based in Nashville, offers a terse taxonomy of breakups in “Different Kind of Love,” from her second album due next month. “Some of them I knew it best to hesitate/Some I’ve never seen again,” she notes. The setting seems retro at first: a hypnotic rockabilly shuffle with a hefty backbeat and plenty of reverb on the guitar, soon to be punched up by a saxophone section. But it’s not back-to-basics: extra guitars and other, more elusive sounds thicken the mix, as Victoria gets around to a classic, nonnegotiable demand: “Tell me, who do you love?” PARELESPotty Mouth, ‘22’The pop-punk trio Pottymouth, three women who have been working together since their teens, confronts aging with a galloping punk-rock beat in — really, this is not a high number — “22.” Abby Weems sings, “Oh, 22 — I still do what I used to do.” And why not? Their speed and passion haven’t faded. PARELESPriests, ‘The Seduction of Kansas’Ex Hex, ‘Cosmic Cave’Two Washington, D.C. trios that aren’t afraid to think and rock at the same time are returning this spring: Ex Hex’s “It’s Real” is due March 22 and Priests’ “The Seduction of Kansas” will be released on April 5. Priests’ title track is like a semiotics class set to an arty dance beat: the singer Katie Alice Greer flings around signifiers of American culture — Superman, Dorothy, Applebee’s — before repeating a vow that teeters between genuine and controlling: “It’s true, I’m the one that loves you.” Ex Hex, led by Helium and Wild Flag’s Mary Timony, start off with a surfy bop that glances back to the Ramones’ interpretation of girl-group pop. Their lips aren’t sealed. CARYN GANZLana Del Rey, ‘Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have — But I Have It’A stark stunner from Lana Del Rey, narrating as someone who’s “24/7 Sylvia Plath/Writing in blood on your walls/‘Cause the ink in my pen don’t look good in my pad.” The arrangement is minimal piano, haunting as an empty, dark cave. And Del Rey spins into deliciously morbid, almost absurdist lyrics: “Hello, it’s the most famous woman you know on the iPad/Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ‘Hi, Dad.’” CARAMANICASam Smith and Normani, ‘Dancing With a Stranger’A random rebound hookup: That’s the premise of “Dancing with a Stranger.” It isn’t much of a duet; it’s more like a pair of solos telling parallel stories. “Look what you made me do/I’m with somebody new,” Sam Smith and Normani sing together, while they head off to separate trysts. PARELESGesaffelstein featuring the Weeknd, ‘Lost in the Fire’The Weeknd is back to his louche ways on “Lost in the Fire,” the second single from “Hyperion,” the forthcoming album by the gloomy French electro-house producer Gesaffelstein. The mood is overcast 1980s Miami, and the singing blends empathy with eroticism. No one is better than the Weeknd at underscoring the trauma common to both. CARAMANICAGary Clark Jr., ‘This Land’The Texas bluesman Gary Clark Jr. announces that he’s “paranoid and pissed-off” as he charges into the title song of his coming album, “This Land,” declaring that he’s bought himself 50 acres “right in the middle of Trump country” and is braced for racist neighbors: “I see you looking out your window/Can’t wait to call the police on me.” All the tones are confrontational and raw: a distorted bass line, Clark’s not-always-in-tune lead guitar, his gruff voice, an underlying blues-meets-reggae riff. The video imagery invokes slavery, lynchings, Confederate flags and cross-burning bonfires. “I’m America’s son,” he taunts. “This is where I come from.” PARELESStella Donnelly, ‘Old Man’Here is the #MeToo movement in action, simultaneously methodical and melodic. The midtempo folk-rock behind Stella Donnelly’s voice doesn’t telegraph her fury, but she’s reading a self-defense manual and preparing to execute painful moves against someone — married, prosperous, powerful — who is acting inappropriately. “Are you scared of me old man,” she sings, “or are you scared of what I’ll do?” PARELESKassa Overall featuring Judi Jackson, ‘Who’s on the Playlist’ Kassa Overall’s new album — the irreverently titled “Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz” — attests to the diverse musical identity of this drummer, producer and rapper. It’s one of the few genuine-sounding, full-scope amalgams of contemporary hip-hop and jazz to surface in recent years. On “Who’s on the Playlist,” as the pianist Sullivan Fortner traces the chords to Miles Davis and Bill Evans’s “Blue in Green,” Overall, 36, daubs his snare drum with brushes, then adds a splatter of electronic percussion. He starts the track with a mumbly, ironic Master P quote before cracking a window into his heart on a verse that grows tensile and urgent before stopping up short. Judi Jackson, a young British jazz singer, shows that the interdisciplinary spirit is contagious — or at least, generational: She sings in an Erykah Badu purr for most of the song, then rattles off a cold rap verse. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLOTomas Nordmark, ‘Human’“Human,” an electronic instrumental by the Swedish composer Tomas Nordmark, has a meditative, nearly ambient foundation: sustained, consonant tones like distant horns. But the foreground is jittery, full of unpredictable, glassy tones that briefly hover, then disappear. Mood: inscrutable.

5c531b143a125f5075c0754b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/science/polar-vortex-experiments.html,"For the latest developments, read our cold weather live briefing. EVANSTON, Ill. — It was minus 15 degrees here on Wednesday afternoon, near the epicenter of the polar vortex, and school had been canceled for much of the week. “How are we going to survive?” one mother asked on a text thread Tuesday night. My phone pinged at 9 a.m. Wednesday with a plaintive message from someone else: “We’ve already gone through my two craft projects, painted and watched an hour of TV.”At times like these, modern parents turn to Google and YouTube and Pinterest, which beckon with seemingly simple and fun science experiments for frigid temperatures. But as my 7-year-old son, Gus, and his friend Eren, 8, learned on Wednesday when we tested a handful of popular cold-weather experiments, science doesn’t always follow the neat path of a viral video.1. Instant slushiesSeveral videos demonstrate how to super-chill soda. A similar experiment instantly freezes water. We shook up two one-liter bottles of Sprite and placed them outside of our front door, where my phone told me it was minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We also put a small bottle of spring water alongside them to test the instant-ice trick.The idea was to try to cool the soda and the water below their freezing point without turning them solid. Without the impurities found in tap water, there is nothing to start the nucleation process that causes water to freeze, delivering a supercooled liquid that, once jostled or disturbed, will instantly turn to a slushy ice.But two hours later, the bottles outside our house were already halfway solid. Eren, Gus and my 3-year-old daughter, Hildy, didn’t seem to care as they slurped down cups of the stuff.“What did we learn today?” my husband, Alex, said. “The internet is broken.”Olivia Castellini, a senior exhibit developer at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, offered several other possible explanations. Our spring water might not have been pure enough, and we may have waited too long. Next time, she recommended timing how long it took to freeze one bottle, then putting out another bottle and returning about 15 minutes earlier to catch the liquid at exactly the moment. “You have to find just the right amount of time to super cool it,” Dr. Castellini said.ImageBudding scientists, from left, Eren, Gus and Hildy, patiently awaited the results of the instant slushie experiment. CreditDanielle Scruggs for The New York Times2. The balloon trickThis experiment is designed to show how the volume of a gas expands as it warms, and contracts as it cools. The method: Blow up balloons in warm air, then expose them to cold air and they will deflate. They will reinflate when you return them to warm air. This is the same reason car tires deflate in cold weather, said Michael Kennedy, a research professor and director of Northwestern University’s Science in Society, a science education center.We inflated half a dozen balloons inside, then bundled up and went outside to wait for them to shrink in the minus 39 degree windchill. And we waited. Gus and Eren decided to bury their balloons in a snow bank. Hildy’s flew into the street.When we could no longer feel our noses, we put the remaining balloons in a bag, tied it to the door handle, and rushed inside. After about 45 minutes, the balloons had deflated only slightly and we realized we hadn’t been very scientific: It might have been wise to first measure the balloons’ original circumference, for example.ImageAlex, the lab assistant,   prepared the balloon experiment for the scientists.CreditDanielle Scruggs for The New York TimesOnce back inside, the balloons did return to their previous shape, but by this time only the adults cared. The child scientists wanted more Sprite slushies.Dr. Castellini recommended tying a string around the balloons, placing them outside, in a window, where you can watch them from the comfort of your home. When the string falls off, they’ve shrunk.3. Freezing bubblesOf all the cold-weather experiments, the one I was most looking forward to was the frozen-bubble trick. The online videos are magical, demonstrating how a normally ethereal soap bubble hardens into a lacy globe when the temperature is just right.We tried two versions of bubble wands — a more traditional wand with a small, round opening, and a large, oblong variety designed for bigger bubbles.Once outside, both wands created perfect bubbles, but it was hard to get a look at them because the wind whipped them down the street. Still, it was fun to watch them pop as they flew out of the wands, leaving frozen skins that dropped to the ground. If we waited too long, the bubble solution froze in the wand, creating a translucent pane that we could poke with our fingers.Bubbles, Dr. Castellini said, are really a “water and soap sandwich,” with soap encasing a layer of water. In warmer weather, the air inside the bubble expands as it warms, popping the bubble before it gets far. But in cold weather, the water sandwiched inside the soap has a chance to freeze before the bubble pops.Dr. Kennedy suggested experimenting with different solutions to create the longest-lasting bubbles. Many people add glycerin, which gives the bubble strength, he said.4. Boiling water cloudImageThe boiling water cloud experiment was successfully repeated four times.CreditDanielle Scruggs for The New York TimesThis trick resurfaces during nearly every cold snap, along with the inevitable safety warnings (to riff off Jim Croce, don’t throw it into the wind).“The cool thing about water is that it can exist in liquid, solid and gas states all at the same time,” Dr. Castellini said. By throwing boiling water into frigid air, she said, “you’re manipulating that transition.” Because cold air can’t absorb water the way warm air can, the water that is thrown has to go somewhere — so it freezes in tiny droplets and falls to the ground in a dramatic cloud.The experiment works best with extremely cold air, and we certainly had that on Wednesday. We repeated the experiment four times — throwing about a half of a cup of boiling water out of a steel travel mug — and each time, the water dissipated in a billowing puff of ice crystals. 5. Maple syrup taffyGiven the demand for Sprite slushies, I had saved our other sugar-laden experiment for last.Several websites describe a simple recipe for maple syrup taffy. Pack snow into a pan and place it in the freezer. Heat maple syrup to about 240 degrees Fahrenheit, checking with a candy thermometer. Pour the syrup over the snow, where it will harden into a chewy taffy.ImageThe hypothesis: That pouring boiling maple syrup on cold, cold snow would make taffy.CreditDanielle Scruggs for The New York TimesOur syrup boiled over when it reached about 220 degrees, preventing us from heating it to the right temperature. By now, the children had ripped their blankets from their beds, fashioned them into capes, and were begging for iPad time. I poured the syrup over the snow, and the hot liquid turned everything into a slushy mess. No taffy in sight.Use a larger pot next time, our science consultants suggested, and cook the syrup more slowly.There’s still time to try again, I suppose. The high on Thursday is expected to be just slightly warmer, at minus 1 degree, and school is still canceled. Not all experiments turn out as planned. “But that’s really the fun of science, is that you didn’t get the results you expect,” Dr. Kennedy said. “You start asking questions about why didn’t I get what I thought?”“At the heart of science are questions,” he said, “not facts.” More coverage on the polar weather conditionsExtreme Cold Weather Spreads EastJan. 31, 2019Cold Weather Tips From Chicagoans Who Really Know What They’re Talking AboutJan. 30, 2019A Merciless Cold Lingers in the MidwestJan. 30, 2019[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"

The revamped and renamed version, introduced with much fanfare last week at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., charges subscribers $9.99 a month ($12.99 in Canada) for content from more than 300 titles, including The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Time, The Atlantic and People, as well as The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. (Also included: Airbnb Magazine, Birds & Blooms, Retro Gamer and Salt Water Sportsman, befitting the app’s conceit as an omnibus newsstand.)Weighing the pros and cons, Ms. Wasserstein concluded that Apple News Plus would allow her publications to reach “a new audience in an environment that feels right for us.”Going into business with a tech giant was a calculated risk. Like most publishers, New York Media had seen its revenue shrink in an internet environment where Google and Facebook scoop up advertising dollars and have great influence over what people read. (New York Media’s online sales have grown more recently.) There’s a sense among Manhattan’s media ranks that any deal with Silicon Valley amounts to a fool’s bargain.Now, by necessity, magazines, newspapers and websites have learned to be promiscuous tradesmen to stop relying on one revenue source. They have embraced new business lines like branded content, conferences and podcasts just to diversify and stay afloat.ImagePamela Wasserstein, the chief executive of New York Media, said she signed on with Apple at a time when media executives were ""more cautious"" about partnerships with tech companies.CreditCole Wilson for The New York TimesMs. Wasserstein was among the publishers at the Steve Jobs Theater when Apple unveiled the service. On stage, Tim Cook, the chief executive, contrasted Apple’s editorial approach to the “very different choice” other companies have made. It was a notable remark, given the criticism of Facebook and Google over their role in spreading misinformation.Apple’s plan was something altogether different, Mr. Cook promised. “This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level,” he said. Cheers bounced around the room — half occupied by Apple employees — as glossy magazine covers skated across the giant screen at his back.The marketing event seems to have accomplished its goal. More than 200,000 people subscribed to Apple News Plus in its first 48 hours — more than Texture had amassed at its peak, according to two people with knowledge of the figures who asked not to be named to discuss confidential information. (Texture’s subscribers have not been counted toward Apple’s subscribers.)The New York Times and The Washington Post did not join the effort, despite intense lobbying from Apple. Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said the problem with the app, from his perspective, was how it “jumbled different news sources into these superficially attractive mixtures,” making it difficult for users to know which publication they’re consuming. A spokeswoman for The Post said that the paper’s “focus is on growing our own subscription base” and that it was not interested in offering its wares through another company.Some executives who said yes to the plan seemed less than sanguine, but they declined to comment publicly for fear of upsetting Apple or violating the ironclad nondisclosure agreements the news companies had signed.ImageFor $9.99 a month, people can have access to more than 300 publications at Apple News Plus. Or for $7.50 a month, they can subscribe to The New Yorker alone.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesIn addition to allowing their publications to be part of Apple’s big bundle, publishers have risked cannibalizing their own subscription efforts by signing on. At $9.99 a month, Apple News Plus is a bargain, especially for casual readers. The Journal, by contrast, charges a monthly fee of $39 for digital access. Online subscriptions to The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Wired — all owned by Condé Nast — together cost more than $10 a month. The New Yorker by itself costs $7.50.The day after the splashy announcement, The New Yorker found itself on the defensive after a Reuters headline blared: “Is it time to dump your New Yorker subscription?” In reply, Michael Luo, the editor of The New Yorker’s website, sounded off in a 13-part tweetstorm advising readers not to dump the magazine. Only a portion of its archive would be available on the Apple service, he wrote, and readers could miss out on certain articles by Ronan Farrow, Jane Mayer and Doreen St. Félix, not to mention the weekly crossword.“The best way to read ALL that we do @newyorker every day and every week is to subscribe,” Mr. Luo tweeted.Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner and publisher of The Los Angeles Times, seemed unworried about tying the paper’s fortunes to Apple, saying in an email that the service would “encourage more people to pay for quality content.”The Journal reported that, thanks to the deal with Apple, it would add 50 people to its newsroom. But the union that represents the paper’s employees noted the new job listings were open to contract workers.“It would be the first time that we’d see a move toward an unprotected work force,” Tim Martell, the union’s executive director, said. “We don’t like the uncertainty.”To abide by the union’s contract with The Journal, Mr. Martell added, contract workers in the newsroom would be allowed to work for a maximum of 12 months. That suggests the Journal sees these hires as a temporary assignment — a compromise approach — as it gauges the benefits and costs of the Apple partnership.ImageRupert Murdoch was a driving force behind The Wall Street Journal's decision to be a part of Apple's new service.CreditDavid Moir/ReutersThe majority of Journal stories will appear on the service, but with only a three-day archive. Content for niche groups, such as CFO Journal, which is aimed at the financial community, and CMO Today, geared toward advertising professionals, will not be included.For Rupert Murdoch, the owner of The Journal since 2007, the partnership is a way for him to realize his long-held dream of turning the paper into something of interest to readers beyond Wall Street and corporate boardrooms.The mogul was the driving force behind the Apple deal, according to two executives close to Mr. Murdoch. He wants The Journal to include more general interest, sports and lifestyle coverage, and the partnership with Apple gives the paper a concrete reason to move beyond its core readership.Unswayed by sentiment, Mr. Murdoch, 88, recently sold off the bulk of his television and film properties as he refocused on the news business and reshaped his empire into an entity built to survive the final steps of the digital revolution. He was able to extract better terms from Apple than other publishers, the people close to him said, including the ability to exit on a time frame that would be more favorable to The Journal.Mr. Murdoch has worked with Apple in the past. In 2011, when tablets were supposedly going to save journalism, he poured millions into an iPad publication, The Daily, with the help of Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. The effort failed to make its mark and was shut down after less than two years.Publications that originated at the now defunct Time Inc. — like Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune — are also part of Apple News Plus. They were pushed into the arrangement as part of a deal struck by Meredith, the company that purchased them in 2017, according to two news executives familiar with the matter. Although Meredith sold Time and Fortune last year and is looking to move Sports Illustrated, the three publications appear to be locked in to Apple News Plus, at least for the time being. (Meredith and Apple declined to comment.)The economics of Apple’s venture will vary from title to title. After the company takes half the subscription price, its partners will split the rest. How much each media company receives is based on the amount of time readers devote to its content. That model mimics Spotify and Apple Music, which pay record labels based on how often their tracks are streamed.ImageLauren Kern, the editor in chief at Apple News, will help determine which articles receive prime placement on the new app.CreditJustin Kaneps for The New York TimesThe visibility of individual articles will depend on Apple’s algorithm, which takes into account a user’s preference — you can “follow” a particular magazine or topic — as well as the judgments of Lauren Kern, the editor in chief of Apple News, and her team.In contrast with Google and Facebook, Apple has promoted the human touch. The presence of Ms. Kern, a former editor at New York magazine, has to some degree assuaged publishers’ fears of algorithmic tyranny.“Lauren being there gives me confidence, but it’s not that she knows who we are, but that she knows what great content is,” said Ms. Wasserstein, of New York Media.Although Ms. Kern provides a link between the news media and Silicon Valley, Apple will also have to get used to the journalists now associated with its team. The New Yorker weighed in on the Cupertino event with a satirical story headlined “Tim Cook’s Big Apple Circus.”Apple got another taste of what it has signed up for after it hosted a private party last week for its new partners at the company’s Lower Manhattan loft. In its coverage of the event, Vanity Fair, one of those partners, included a quote from an unnamed partygoer who summed up the mood of the room and, perhaps, the industry at large.The quote became the story’s headline: “Are we at a party, or a wake?”"
5c55f28f3a125f5075c07baf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/children-bored.html,"“I’m bored.” It’s a puny little phrase, yet it has the power to fill parents with a cascade of dread, annoyance and guilt. If someone around here is bored, someone else must have failed to enlighten or enrich or divert. And how can anyone — child or adult — claim boredom when there’s so much that can and should be done? Immediately.But boredom is something to experience rather than hastily swipe away. And not as some kind of cruel Victorian conditioning, recommended because it’s awful and toughens you up. Despite the lesson most adults learned growing up — boredom is for boring people — boredom is useful. It’s good for you.If kids don’t figure this out early on, they’re in for a nasty surprise. School, let’s face it, can be dull, and it isn’t actually the teacher’s job to entertain as well as educate. Life isn’t meant to be an endless parade of amusements. “That’s right,” a mother says to her daughter in Maria Semple’s 2012 novel, “Where’d You Go, Bernadette.” “You are bored. And I’m going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it’s boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it’s on you to make life interesting, the better off you’ll be.”People used to accept that much of life was boring. Memoirs of pre-21st-century life are rife with tedium. When not idling in drawing rooms, members of the leisured class took long walks and stared at trees. They went motoring and stared at more trees. Those who had to work had it a lot harder. Agricultural and industrial jobs were often mind-numbing; few people were looking to be fulfilled by paid labor. Children could expect those kinds of futures and they got used to the idea from an early age, left unattended with nothing but bookshelves and tree branches, and later, bad afternoon television.Only a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grown-ups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate. And children came to appreciate their empty agendas. In an interview with GQ magazine, Lin-Manuel Miranda credited his unattended afternoons with fostering inspiration. “Because there is nothing better to spur creativity than a blank page or an empty bedroom,” he said.Nowadays, subjecting a child to such inactivity is viewed as a dereliction of parental duty. In a much-read story in The Times, “The Relentlessness of Modern Parenting,” Claire Cain Miller cited a recent study that found that regardless of class, income or race, parents believed that “children who were bored after school should be enrolled in extracurricular activities, and that parents who were busy should stop their task and draw with their children if asked.”Every spare moment is to be optimized, maximized, driven toward a goal.When not being uberparented, kids today are left to their own devices — their own digital devices, that is. Parents preparing for a long car ride or airplane trip are like Army officers plotting a complicated land maneuver. Which movies to load onto the iPad? Should we start a new family-friendly podcast? Is this an O.K. time to let the kids play Fortnite until their brains melt into the back seat? What did parents in the ’70s do when kids were bored in the way-back? Nothing! They let them breathe in gas fumes. Torture their siblings. And since it wasn’t actually for wearing, play with the broken seatbelt.If you complained about being bored back then, you were really asking for it. “Go outside,” you might get, or worse, “Clean your room.” Was this fun? No. Was it helpful? Yes.Because things happen when you’re bored. Some of the most boring jobs I’ve had were also the most creative. Working at an import factory after school, I pasted photos of ugly Peruvian sweaters onto sales sheets. My hands became encrusted with glue as the sweaters blurred into a clumpy sameness. For some reason, everything smelled like molasses. My mind had no choice but to drift into an elaborate fantasy realm. It’s when you are bored that stories set in. Checking out groceries at the supermarket, I invented narratives around people’s purchases. The man buying eggplant and a six-pack of Bud at 9 p.m.: Which was the must-get item and which the impulse purchase? How did my former fifth-grade teacher feel about my observing her weekly purchase of Nutter Butters?Once you’ve truly settled into the anesthetizing effects of boredom, you find yourself en route to discovery. With monotony, small differences begin to emerge, between those trees, those sweaters. This is why so many useful ideas occur in the shower, when you’re held captive to a mundane activity. You let your mind wander and follow it where it goes.Of course, it’s not really the boredom itself that’s important; it’s what we do with it. When you reach your breaking point, boredom teaches you to respond constructively, to make something happen for yourself. But unless we are faced with a steady diet of stultifying boredom, we never learn how.The idea isn’t that you suffer through crushing tedium indefinitely like Neville (“N is for Neville who died of ennui”) of “The Gashlycrumb Tinies.” It’s that you learn how to vanquish it. This may come in several forms: You might turn inward and use the time to think. You might reach for a book. You might imagine your way to a better job. Boredom leads to flights of fancy. But ultimately, to self-discipline. To resourcefulness.The ability to handle boredom, not surprisingly, is correlated with the ability to focus and to self-regulate. Research has shown that people with attention disorders are particularly prone to boredom. It makes sense that in a hyperstimulating world, what at first seems captivating now feels less so; what was once mildly diverting may now be flat-out dull.It’s especially important that kids get bored — and be allowed to stay bored — when they’re young. That it not be considered “a problem” to be avoided or eradicated by the higher-ups, but instead something kids grapple with on their own.We’ve stopped training children to do this. Rather than teach them to absorb material that is slower, duller and decidedly two-dimensional, like a lot of worthwhile information is, schools cave in to what they say children expect: fun. Teachers spend more time concocting ways to “engage” students through visuals and “interactive learning” (read: screens, games) tailored to their Candy Crushed attention spans. Kids won’t listen to long lectures, goes the argument, so it’s on us to serve up learning in easier-to-swallow portions.But surely teaching children to endure boredom rather than ratcheting up the entertainment will prepare them for a more realistic future, one that doesn’t raise false expectations of what work or life itself actually entails. One day, even in a job they otherwise love, our kids may have to spend an entire day answering Friday’s leftover email. They may have to check spreadsheets. Or assist robots at a vast internet-ready warehouse.This sounds boring, you might conclude. It sounds like work, and it sounds like life. Perhaps we should get used to it again, and use it to our benefit. Perhaps in an incessant, up-the-ante world, we could do with a little less excitement.Pamela Paul is the editor of the Book Review and a co-author of the forthcoming book “How to Raise a Reader.""Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
5c6dab163a125f5075c0aa70,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/technology/personaltech/samsung-s10.html,"ImageThe Samsung Galaxy FoldCreditSamsungSAN FRANCISCO — It’s hard to imagine how smartphones could get much better. Most are already zippy and equipped with jumbo screens, powerful cameras and face scanners. So what else can we look forward to?It turns out, plenty. For a peek at the future of the phone, look to Samsung, the world’s largest handset maker. On Wednesday, the South Korean company showed off a family of four new Galaxy phones that incorporate new technologies and features that may start spreading to other smartphones.Of the four new devices, one will work on next-generation ultrafast 5G cellular networks, which means it can download a movie in seconds rather than minutes. Three of the models will have slightly larger screens and more complex camera systems than their predecessors. And Samsung is also teasing a fifth device that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase the phone’s screen size to suit its owner. It is expected to be available in the United States on April 26 and in Europe on May 3. There’s a lot to unpack here. Here’s what you need to know about what’s coming with screen sizes, cameras, 5G and the elusive foldable phone.Phone screens keep getting bigger. Why would I want this, and won’t this add volume to my pocket?Many phone makers, including Samsung, Apple and Google, have focused on making screens larger without adding bulk to their bodies. To do this, they stretched the screens from one edge to another while shrinking the bezels, or the borders surrounding the screen.Samsung is continuing this trend. Its new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus phones have 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch displays, up from the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch screens on last year’s Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Even though the screens are bigger, Samsung said, the devices’ body sizes are more compact than their predecessors.The company also unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G, its first phone to work with 5G networks, which will have a jumbo 6.7-inch screen. In addition, it showed the Galaxy S10E, a model with a 5.8-inch display in a body that is smaller than the S9’s, for people who prefer more compact devices.ImageThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditSamsungWhy would you want a bigger screen? When upgrading devices, people are increasingly gravitating toward phones with larger displays. Many feel that they are getting more bang for the buck with bigger screens, as studies have shown that people spend more time using apps, watching videos and browsing the web on big-screen phones.Why would I want a foldable phone?Samsung first showed a prototype of its foldable phone at a conference for software developers last year. When folded up, it looked like a phone with a small screen, and once unfolded, the screen doubled in size. At a media event on Wednesday, Samsung shared some details about its foldable device, Galaxy Fold. It has two screens — a smaller one and a larger one — with a hinge in the middle containing multiple interlocking gears. When folded up, the viewable screen measures 4.6 inches. Unfolding the device reveals its 7.3-inch display, which is the size of a tablet screen.Samsung said it was working with Google, YouTube and others to develop apps that seamlessly transition between a single screen when folded up and the double screens in unfolded mode.You may want a foldable phone if you love tablet computers. Plenty of people enjoy using tablets like Apple’s iPad and Amazon’s Fire Tablet for their roomy screens that are upward of seven inches diagonally. That makes watching videos, reading books and playing games more enjoyable. The downside is that tablets are so large that they aren’t pocketable. A foldable phone, in theory, will let people have a tablet that can be folded up and carried in a pocket.Other phone makers are expected to jump on this trend. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, posted an image on Twitter this month teasing a foldable phone that will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, the tech trade show in Barcelona, next week.Foldable phones raise plenty of questions. When folded, the device becomes thicker in the pocket, which might make it bulky and uncomfortable. And it’s unclear whether making the displays bendable also makes them more fragile when dropped. Smartphones already have many cameras. Why would I need more?Many newer smartphones include multiple camera lenses that let you produce different camera effects. For example, last year’s iPhone XS included a rear camera with dual lenses; the two lenses worked together to blur the background while sharpening a subject in the foreground, producing what’s known as the bokeh effect.ImageCreditSamsungSamsung’s new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus take this up another notch. Both include a triple camera system arranged horizontally on the back of the phone. The left lens is for zooming, the middle lens contains the main camera, and the right lens features a brand-new ultrawide angle lens for capturing broader shots, like landscapes or a big group gathering at Thanksgiving dinner.What’s more, the Galaxy S10 5G will have a fourth camera for depth-sensing, which will enable richer augmented-reality applications that use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through the smartphone lens.Expect other companies to keep beefing up the number of cameras this year. Apple also plans to add another camera to some of its next iPhones, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Apple declined to comment.What’s the big deal about 5G?Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 5G will be one of the first phones to work with 5G wireless networks, which are a successor to current 4G networks. These new networks will introduce internet speeds so fast that devices will be able to download high-quality videos in a few seconds.But contain your excitement for now. The carriers are still far from deploying a broad 5G network. AT&T said it should have 5G deployed in 21 cities in the first half of this year. Verizon Wireless just did its first 5G data test on a smartphone late last year. There isn’t expected to be much traction for the new cellular technology until 2020.And even when 5G does reach your hometown, there may be confusion about it. In a controversial move, AT&T said that it planned to give different flavors of 5G different names: 5G+ will be the fastest speed taking advantage of brand-new infrastructure, and 5GE will essentially be a faster version of 4G using upgraded 4G equipment.Gordon Mansfield, an AT&T executive, said the labels would be helpful indicators for people with 5G phones. The 5GE icon on a phone screen will inform them they have speeds that are faster than the current 4G networks, and the 5G+ indicator will mean they are getting the fastest speeds possible, he said.Also unclear is how much it will cost for people to buy 5G access — and whether the tremendous speeds will encourage consumers to burn through their cellular data faster than they did with slower technologies. The carriers have yet to announce pricing for data plans using 5G.[What is 5G? Here’s what you need to know about the new network.]Phones have become costly, in some cases exceeding $1,000. Can we expect prices to continue climbing?Yes, in the high-end phone market, where Samsung and Apple compete. The Galaxy Fold, which arrives in stores late April, will cost $1,980.Samsung has not announced pricing of the Galaxy S10 5G, though the device is expected to top $1,000, in part because of its 5G compatibility and depth-sensing camera lens.For Samsung’s phones with more incremental changes, prices are also up.Prices start at $750 for the Galaxy S10E, $900 for the S10 and $1,000 for the S10 Plus. Compare that with the S9 and S9 Plus, which started at $720 and $840.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said she was doubtful that prices could go up much more in the near-term. The $749 iPhone XR, which despite rave reviews has not sold as robustly as some had anticipated, demonstrated that consumers may have hit a threshold.“We’re getting to a point where people will say, you know what, the technology is enough for me — I might want a different phone, but I don’t want more,” she said."

5c48ca0b3a125f5075c05eda,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/technology/personaltech/facebook-online-privacy.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he’s using.You’ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people’s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?I’m not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting on how tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can — which is not very well. Most of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as the advertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.I use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google’s operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I’ve turned off location tracking for almost all of the apps I use, and I’ve tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.For search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I’m doing.Despite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable.

For example, DuckDuckGo has become his go-to alternative for search.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesSo what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I’ve turned off — or “paused” — all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users’ browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I’ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.For all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I’m missing. And that’s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.Have you changed your use of social media after writing about some of the data practices of Facebook? When I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google — and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.That’s partly because I don’t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it’s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don’t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don’t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.The social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it’s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in — once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife’s phone — I’m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.Is deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?Not in the slightest. It may interfere with Facebook’s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do. ImageA telescoping back scratcher in the coffee mug is ""the most important tool of all.""CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesDeleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about “shadow profiles” — dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.What are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter? I don’t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It’s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection. When I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I’ve also used tools at the National Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It’s basically Google for “dark money.” More recently, I’ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you’re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted — often information that is otherwise not public.ImageAmong his apps, LinkedIn has helped Mr. Confessore investigate stories by leading him to former employees who became sources.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.If you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?I’m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it’s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way. The privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I’ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it’s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.I’ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer — and probably more stringent — laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to “opt out” of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?We’re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don’t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don’t actually like.Sonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can’t I just play my songs directly from my phone’s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)Image""Hey, Sonos, why can’t I just play my songs directly from my phone’s Music app?""CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesI’ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter’s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.I have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it’s New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me.

5c5b5c433a125f5075c08603,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/technology/personaltech/children-charges-mobile-games.html,"Is your child a “whale”?A teenager once spent $6,500 on Facebook games over two weeks, according to a recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting. Some Facebook employees internally referred to these children as “whales,” a term typically used by casinos to describe the highest of high rollers.The report follows actions by the Federal Trade Commission five years ago that required Apple and Google to issue millions of dollars in refunds to parents whose children made unauthorized in-app charges. In 2017, the F.T.C. made a similar arrangement with Amazon. At the heart of all of this are mobile games that persuade children — who are the most vulnerable — to buy virtual goods using their parents’ credit card accounts while they are playing. It has become such an issue that these games have been called “bait apps” in class-action lawsuits.So what can adults do to prevent their children from falling prey to bait apps and running up their credit card bills?Unfortunately, preventing unwanted in-app purchases is far from straightforward. Many young ones are clever about finding workarounds when they are blocked. And tech companies typically don’t have much incentive to invest in safeguards because these purchases generate revenue.Jim Steyer, who runs the nonprofit Common Sense Media, said fighting bait apps is often confusing. Even though his group reviews tech products for families and suggests limits on tech, he himself often has to call tech companies to reverse charges made by his 14-year-old son inside apps like Fortnite, the popular shooter game.“It’s incumbent on the tech companies who are selling you these apps and games to make it much easier for parents,” Mr. Steyer said. “I think it’s really unfair to assume that the average parent is tech savvy.”To come up with some solutions, I gathered many gadgets in my household — including devices from Apple, Google and Amazon — to devise a guide to fighting bait apps. Here’s what you should know.AppleLet’s start with Apple, the maker of many of our devices and a purveyor of mobile games through its App Store. It offers several effective tools for restricting in-app payments on iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch.One is Ask to Buy, a set of controls that requires a parent to approve each app purchase on a child’s device. It can be set up with the following steps:A parent first sets up a family sharing account, by going into the settings app, selecting “set up family sharing” and following the instructions. The parent then sends an invitation to the child’s Apple device to join the family account. (If the child doesn’t have an Apple ID, the parent can create one and add it to the family group.)Then, the parent goes into the family sharing settings, selects the child’s account and turns on Ask to Buy. It notifies the parent’s device whenever the child tries to buy an app or something inside an app. The parent can approve or reject the purchases.You can also disable in-app payments on Apple devices altogether. Here’s how:On the child’s device settings, choose “screen time” and select “this is my child’s iPhone.”Set a secret passcode and then tap “content & privacy restrictions.” From here, tap “iTunes & App Store purchases.”Then choose “in-app purchases” and select “don’t allow.”An Apple spokeswoman said the company designed the controls to “provide families easy ways to stay informed about kids’ screen time, set appropriate limits and approve their downloads and purchases.”GoogleGoogle’s tool for managing a child’s app purchases on Android devices is incomplete compared with Apple’s. Google offers a parental control tool called Family Link, which includes a setting for requiring parental approval for app purchases. But children can choose to leave Family Link once they turn 13 and remove the restrictions — a limitation I have criticized in the past.While I do not recommend Family Link for managing a child’s app purchases, here’s an alternative method that is more reliable for regulating in-app payments on Android devices:On your child’s Android device, set a password for the Google account that is used for making purchases from Google Play, which is the Android app store. Open the Google Play Store app on the child’s device. Tap the hamburger menu (an icon with three lines) and scroll down to settings. Tap on the “require authentication for purchases” option. Then select “all purchases.”With this setting turned on, you will have to enter your password whenever the child tries to buy an app or goods inside an app. As long as you set a strong password and keep it secret, the child should not be able to make purchases. This solution is imperfect because the child will need to use a separate Google account and password for unrelated tasks, like email, but it is more reliable than Family Link because the restriction won’t expire when the child turns 13. Google declined to comment.FacebookThe process for blocking in-app payments on Facebook is the most lacking and the most confusing, I found.That’s because people can make purchases in games on the social network and on its family of apps — which include Facebook Messenger — in a dizzying variety of ways. Children can spend in games loaded inside Facebook’s mobile apps, which include Facebook and Facebook Messenger, or on a computer using Facebook.com. That means if your children are racking up charges inside Facebook’s iPhone apps, the aforementioned Apple tools will help. If they are spending inside Facebook’s Android apps, the Google solution above might stop them. But if they are buying things inside games on the Facebook website on a computer, there is no direct tool to prevent payments. The best you can do is to go into your child’s Facebook account and remove your payment method from it.In other words, if a minor failed to buy something inside a game using a Facebook mobile app, he or she could go on a computer and use the website to make the purchase, so long as your credit card was handy. This is a glaring loophole. When I called Facebook about it, a spokeswoman pointed me to its Parents Portal, which includes guidelines on how parents can talk to their children about how they use the web.Facebook does have a process for disputing charges and requesting refunds, in the games support section of Facebook. When you visit the web tool, select “process a refund,” click “purchase made by someone under 18 years old” and then choose the unauthorized game.AmazonAmazon offers games for its Fire tablets along with a range of controls for restricting app payments on those devices, which require a password to make purchases. It also offers Amazon FreeTime, which automatically blocks minors from content inside its app store.Here’s how the parental controls work:On the tablet, open the Amazon Appstore app.From there, select “account” and then tap “settings.” Then tap “parental controls” and select “enable parental controls.” With this setting turned on, the Amazon account password will be required to make in-app purchases.And here’s how to set up FreeTime:Swipe down from the top of the screen and select “settings,” and then tap “profiles & family library.”Choose “add a child profile” and create a lock-screen PIN, which your child will not have access to.From the “add child profile” screen, select “choose a profile picture” to add a profile picture. Enter your child’s name, birth date and gender.From here, you can choose “use Amazon FreeTime,” which is suited for children, or “use teen profiles,” which has an aesthetic more suited for teenagers. (Either one will automatically block in-app purchases.)Tap “add profile” and choose the content you want available on the child’s profile. Then tap “done.”FortniteFortnite is an important example of an app that is widely available across many devices. It is popular with children, who want to spend inside the game to buy different items like outfits to make their Fortnite characters look unique. The problem is that even if you prevent your children from buying virtual items inside Fortnite on an iPhone, they might make the purchases elsewhere, like on a PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo console.To prevent that, you will have to be thorough. Assess which products are in your home, and then set up the parental controls for each device, like the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.A spokesman for Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, declined to comment, pointing to the parental controls offered by device makers. Users can also request refunds for unauthorized Fortnite purchases on the company’s website.If tech fails, then what?So here’s what I learned: Fighting bait apps is a lot of work. But when tech fails, parents can always turn to a free tool: disciplining and educating their children. Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he eventually had to teach his teenage son a lesson for his Fortnite splurging. How? He took the game console away.“It does give you a teachable moment to sit down with your kid and talk about being responsible financially, and that you don’t have my permission to spend the money,” he said."

For many of us, their glowing screens are a ubiquitous presence, drawing us in with endless diversions, like the warm ping of social approval delivered in the forms of likes and retweets, and the algorithmically amplified outrage of the latest “breaking” news or controversy. They’re in our hands, as soon as we wake, and command our attention until the final moments before we fall asleep.Steve Jobs would not approve.In 2007, Mr. Jobs took the stage at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco and introduced the world to the iPhone. If you watch the full speech, you’ll be surprised by how he imagined our relationship with this iconic invention, because this vision is so different from the way most of us use these devices now.In the remarks, after discussing the phone’s interface and hardware, he spends an extended amount of time demonstrating how the device leverages the touch screen before detailing the many ways Apple engineers improved the age-old process of making phone calls. “It’s the best iPod we’ve ever made,” Mr. Jobs exclaims at one point. “The killer app is making calls,” he later adds. Both lines spark thunderous applause. He doesn’t dedicate any significant time to discussing the phone’s internet connectivity features until more than 30 minutes into the address.The presentation confirms that Mr. Jobs envisioned a simpler and more constrained iPhone experience than the one we actually have over a decade later. For example, he doesn’t focus much on apps. When the iPhone was first introduced there was no App Store, and this was by design. As Andy Grignon, an original member of the iPhone team, told me when I was researching this topic, Mr. Jobs didn’t trust third-party developers to offer the same level of aesthetically pleasing and stable experiences that Apple programmers could produce. He was convinced that the phone’s carefully designed native features were enough. It was “an iPod that made phone calls,” Mr. Grignon said to me. Mr. Jobs seemed to understand the iPhone as something that would help us with a small number of activities — listening to music, placing calls, generating directions. He didn’t seek to radically change the rhythm of users’ daily lives. He simply wanted to take experiences we already found important and make them better.The minimalist vision for the iPhone he offered in 2007 is unrecognizable today — and that’s a shame.Under what I call the “constant companion model,” we now see our smartphones as always-on portals to information. Instead of improving activities that we found important before this technology existed, this model changes what we pay attention to in the first place — often in ways designed to benefit the stock price of attention-economy conglomerates, not our satisfaction and well-being.We’ve become so used to the constant companion model over the past decade that it’s easy to forget its novelty. As a computer scientist who also writes about the impact of technology on culture, I think it’s important to highlight the magnitude of this shift, as it seems increasingly clear to me that Mr. Jobs probably got it right the first time: Many of us would be better off returning to his original minimalist vision for our phones.Practically speaking, to be a minimalist smartphone user means that you deploy this device for a small number of features that do things you value (and that the phone does particularly well), and then outside of these activities, put it away. This approach dethrones this gadget from a position of constant companion down to a luxury object, like a fancy bike or a high-end blender, that gives you great pleasure when you use it but doesn’t dominate your entire day.To succeed with this approach, a useful first step is to remove from your smartphone any apps that make money from your attention. This includes social media, addictive games and newsfeeds that clutter your screen with “breaking” notifications. Unless you’re a cable news producer, you don’t need minute-by-minute updates on world events, and your friendships are likely to survive even if you have to wait until you’re sitting at your home computer to log on to Facebook or Instagram. In addition, by eliminating your ability to publish carefully curated images to social media directly from your phone, you can simply be present in a nice moment, free from the obsessive urge to document it.Turning our attention to professional activities, if your work doesn’t absolutely demand that you be accessible by email when away from your desk, delete the Gmail app or disconnect the built-in email client from your office servers. It’s occasionally convenient to check in when out and about, but this occasional convenience almost always comes at the cost of developing a compulsive urge to monitor your messages constantly. If you’re not sure whether your work requires phone-based email, don’t ask; just delete the apps and wait to see whether it causes a problem — many people unintentionally exaggerate their need to constantly be available.Once you’ve stripped away the digital chatter clamoring for your attention, your smartphone will return to something closer to the role originally conceived by Mr. Jobs. It will become a well-designed object that comes out occasionally throughout your day to support — not subvert — your efforts to live well: It helps you find that perfect song to listen to while walking across town on a sunny fall afternoon; it loads up directions to the restaurant where you’re meeting a good friend; with just a few swipes, it allows you to place a call to your mom — and then it can go back into your pocket, or your bag, or the hall table by your front door, while you move on with the business of living your real-world life.Early in his 2007 keynote, Mr. Jobs said, “Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.” What he didn’t add, however, was the follow-up promise that “tomorrow, we’re going to reinvent your life.” The iPhone is a fantastic phone, but it was never meant to be the foundation for a new form of existence in which the digital increasingly encroaches on the analog. If you return this innovation to its original limited role, you’ll get more out of both your phone and your life.Cal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown and the author of the forthcoming book “Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.

Others have had something else in mind: Winter is coming. That tagline for HBO’s fantasy colossus, which has grown bigger and bigger since its 2011 debut, has reached peak relevance in the lead-up to the show’s eighth season, which promises a final showdown between the living and the undead White Walkers (who have an ice dragon!). Season 8 should tie up loose ends while answering the big question of who will ultimately win the throne? Regardless of the answer, the brand is all but guaranteed to actively live on. “Five years from now,” the “Thrones” star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau recently told The New York Times, “We will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land.”ImageDominic West, left, and David Oyelowo in “Les Miserables.”CreditLaurence Cendrowicz/BBCLES MISÉRABLES 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).

The writer Ryan O’Connell made a name for himself blogging on the pop culture lifestyle site Thought Catalog, then released a memoir, “I’m Special, and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves,” about his experiences as a disabled gay 20-something. That book provides the basis for this new dark comedy series, which stars O’Connell (a first-time actor) playing a version of himself, with roughly 15-minute-long episodes. The series’s overarching joke “is on people who aren’t disabled, and how they view disabled people,” he recently told The Times. O’Connell said that “giving them a show like ‘Special,’ which is funny and I’m the one making the jokes and I’m the one writing them — I think it makes them feel at ease. They’re like ‘Oh O.K., this isn’t some scary thing. Disabled people are just like me!’ I don’t know why this a revolutionary concept. I just think they don’t know what to do with us at all.”STEVE JOBS: THE MAN IN THE MACHINE (2015) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Alex Gibney anatomizes the legend of Steve Jobs in this ambitious documentary, which charts the Apple leader’s rise and dissects his image as both businessman and transformer of culture, with one eyebrow firmly raised. In his review for The Times, Nicolas Rapold wrote that Gibney’s film “is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs.” But, he noted, “even if this isn’t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across.”"
5c37d8993a125f5075c03d28,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/trump-staff-turnover-leadership.html,"Donald J. Trump’s highly personal management style as a businessman — impetuous, impolitic, sometimes immature — worked. At the very least, it wasn’t publicly discredited very often.Mr. Trump ran his own private company. It was small and largely hidden from the prying eyes of shareholders and government regulators. He was surrounded by longtime loyalists and family members. His main public exposure unfolded in staged settings, on softball talk shows or his own reality-TV show.Now President Trump is running a much larger enterprise. Two years into the Trump administration, it’s increasingly apparent that while the management traits he developed in the private sector may have propelled him into the White House, they’re not serving him well now that he’s there.As Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential historian and author of the recent book “Leadership: In Turbulent Times,” told me this week, Mr. Trump manifestly lacks a long list of traits associated with effective leadership: “humility, acknowledging errors, shouldering blame and learning from mistakes, empathy, resilience, collaboration, connecting with people and controlling unproductive emotions.”The last of these was on display this week, when Mr. Trump stormed out of a negotiating session with Democratic leaders and denounced the meeting in a tweet as “a total waste of time.”The consequences are also becoming apparent: With the government shut down over Mr. Trump’s demand for funding a border wall, the loss of a Republican majority in the House of Representatives and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut, his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern.“With a modicum of management skill he could have gotten his wall, and he would probably be on the path to re-election,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “But he has very few accomplishments to his credit.”That’s not to say Mr. Trump hasn’t displayed some effective management techniques, albeit ones that are rarely discussed in America’s business schools.As Mr. Pfeffer told me this week, Mr. Trump exhibits several qualities that are prevalent among many leaders, including narcissism and dishonesty.“We claim we want nice people, but we don’t,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Studies show that people want to associate with people who win.”“I’ve always won, and I’m going to continue to win,” Mr. Trump reportedly said in 2016.And Mr. Pfeffer noted that the “reality distortion field” that Mr. Trump deploys — ignoring the truth and creating an alternate set of facts — was once associated with the Apple founder Steve Jobs and remains prevalent in Silicon Valley and among entrepreneurial start-ups.Paul Glatzhofer, director of talent solutions at the consulting firm PSI International, agreed that Mr. Trump displayed some positive qualities of effective leadership, such as decisiveness, setting ambitious goals and self-confidence. “You may not like the idea of a wall, but it’s an ambitious goal,” Mr. Glatzhofer said.Nonetheless, he cautioned that the president’s other, negative traits could far outweigh any positives. “When we assess senior leadership, it doesn’t matter how many strengths they have if they also have these flaws that can derail their careers,” he said.Mr. Trump also gets credit for being himself, especially from passionate members of his base. “A quality he seems to have is that he doesn’t care what other people think,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Not many of us are like that. But there’s a certain power in violating conventional norms.”These qualities helped Mr. Trump win in 2016, but they haven’t translated into effective governance, at least not yet. “People often equate the success of an individual with the success of an organization, but they’re not highly correlated,” Mr. Pfeffer said.Mr. Trump was able to assemble a relatively stable and loyal team of people who worked for him for years when he ran his private business. His failure to do so at the White House — save for a couple of survivors including Kellyanne Conway and family members like Jared Kushner — may be his most perplexing and conspicuous management failure.In the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, one-third of his top White House appointees left — unprecedented for the country’s chief executive. For the top dozen appointees, the rate was 50 percent. This past year with still more churn, the total turnover rate hit 83 percent, according to the Brookings Institution, which is tracking personnel moves at the White House. No other president has come close in his first two years.The only survivors among the top 12 White House appointees are Bill McGinley, a low-profile adviser and the cabinet secretary, and Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.“He’s an extreme case,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “He’s never really had to moderate his behavior or compromise or answer to a real boss. In the real world, you can’t just fire everybody.”Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, senior research fellow at Brookings and author of the staff turnover study, said, “The turmoil inhibits his ability to complete his campaign promises.”She added: “It creates an environment of anxiety and chaos. The stress and long hours are bad enough under normal circumstances.”And the unceremonious way in which Mr. Trump has pushed people out is likely to deter job candidates. Ms. Tenpas cited the failure to find a permanent successor to Mr. Kelly as chief of staff, a position “that in any other administration people would be jumping up and down for.”"

In the spirit of fresh starts, progressives should now confront an even more basic challenge: their complexity problem.In recent decades progressives have not prioritized making policies and programs easy for most Americans to understand, use and benefit from. Fixing this problem will mean overcoming a streak of perfectionism and a certain intellectual defensiveness, but it must be done if progressives are to make government popular again.The Affordable Care Act is a good example of the complexity problem. Yes, it was an important policy achievement, and yes, many of its problems can be rightly blamed on industry resistance and Republican efforts to dismantle it.But the act is also exceptionally hard to understand and discouragingly daunting to make use of. An emphasis on “choice” and “transparency” resulted in a law that only a rational-choice theorist could love. The act made health insurance more complicated, not less, which is one reason that such a high percentage of medical bills go to paying administrative costs, and why the Affordable Care Act is much less popular than it could be.It used to be said that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged. Today she’s a liberal who tried to pay a babysitter without breaking the law. It is admirable that Democrats try to tackle society’s thorniest problems with the often unwieldy tools of government, but that is not an excuse for programs that are too complex for their own good.The truth is that good public policy can actually be elegant and simple to understand, even when the social problem that it’s addressing is complex. Social Security, Medicare, bans on indoor smoking, the “do not call” list (when it worked) and public libraries are examples of government solutions that are easy to understand and to benefit from.Avoidance of complexity and minimizing choices are hallmarks of good design, as we have learned from the technological revolution in user interfaces. The age of impossible-to-use computers and incomprehensible TV remote controls has given way to the sleek and intuitive interfaces offered by pioneers like Steve Jobs of Apple. What progressives most need now is not more brains, but better policy designers.One major obstacle to simple, effective public policy is people like me — the expert class. Many of us are in denial, seeing complexity as a necessary evil, an unavoidable feature of answers to hard problems, even a technocratic badge of honor. We criticize conservatives for relying on simplistic slogans like “cut taxes” and “drill, baby, drill” instead of nuanced, empirically informed assessments of economic growth and environmental management.Progressives are right to consider expertise essential to good policymaking. But policy experts are rarely good at interface design, for we have a bad habit of assuming that people have unlimited time and attention and that to respect them means offering complete transparency and a multiplicity of choices. Real respect for the public involves appreciating what the public actually wants and needs. The reality is that most Americans are short on time and attention and already swamped by millions of daily tasks and decisions. They would prefer that the government solve problems for them — not create more work for them.To be sure, not every interaction with government can be all sweetness and light. The business of government, after all, also involves confrontation, as when it ferrets out fraud or brings murderers to justice. And some challenges, like financial regulation and ensuring drug safety, are irreducibly complex. It is often said that today’s world is more complex than ever before — but for a good designer, that calls for more effort, not giving up.For what the public wants from government is help with complexity, not exposure to it. This generation of progressives, to achieve lasting success, must accept that simplicity and popularity are not a dumbing-down of policy, but rather the unavoidable requirement for its success.Tim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, a contributing opinion writer and the author, most recently, of “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5ca5f1b549f0eacbf1f80dc0,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/04/world/africa/04reuters-rwanda-genocide-families.html,"AGAHOZO SHALOM YOUTH VILLAGE, Rwanda — Vincent de Paul Ruhumuriza was born in Rwanda just a few months before genocide consigned his father to an unknown grave and traumatized his mother so badly she still screams and shakes at any mention of that time. But, helped by a model of healing dating back to the Holocaust, the 25-year-old has finished his education and blended into a new family, where individuals grieving lost loved ones have rebuilt their lives by caring for each other. ""People should not be driven by the past,"" the bearded young man told Reuters this week, as the country prepared to mark a quarter of a century since Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. ""I want to grow into someone who will benefit society."" Seven years ago, Ruhumuriza's life was on course to become another small tragedy in a nation where every family is touched by grief. He and his mother lived in poverty. His father's death in the genocide was a mystery - the only time he ever tried to ask about it, his mother had a breakdown. ""Other people ... told how she was beaten, how she was tortured, got raped,"" he said. ""She became like a mad person. She got traumatized."" THE PLACE WHERE TEARS ARE DRIEDThen, in 2014, just as Ruhumuriza was about to drop out, his school got in touch with the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village, whose Hebrew-Kinyarwandan name translates as ""the place where tears are dried"".The village was set up in 2008 by a South African-born lawyer, Anne Heyman, who had worked in the United States. Heyman and her husband raised more than $12 million to help care for families ripped apart by the genocide, taking their model from Israel's Youth Villages, which created new families for children whose parents had died in the Holocaust. Rwanda's genocide, sparked by the assassination of the president, lasted around 100 days and stopped after rebels fought their way to the capital, led by Paul Kagame, Rwanda's current ruler.More than 95,000 children were orphaned, the United Nations estimates, and around 300,000 children were killed. For some of the survivors, Heyman's village offered healing and purpose. ""Having 15 children around you can calling you Mama, and you helping them to conquer their past, that is a great contribution to the nation,"" said Emeritha Mukarusagara, a slender, bespectacled 57-year-old with long braids who became a foster mother after being widowed in the genocide. She spent months hidden by a neighbor, heavily pregnant, terrified and filled with grief for her murdered husband. She keeps his picture on her phone but still cannot discuss his death. Since then, she has fostered dozens of vulnerable children, including Ruhumuriza, who needed families. NEW PURPOSEA shy teenager, he arrived into a large, boisterous community where children live 15 to a house, watched over by a strict but loving foster parent they are all encouraged to call Mama. It was strange to call another woman Mama, he said. It was even stranger to have a brother. He liked it. Ruhumuriza threw himself into his studies, becoming the school president, learning about Steve Jobs, and forming a deep bond with his foster mother. When he graduated and found a job in the construction industry, and a steady paycheck, he asked her what he should do with it. Go home, she said. Build a house for the lonely woman who gave birth to you. ""Now my mother lives in the house I built,"" he said proudly. ""Mama Emeritha is one of my cornerstones ... she is one of the best advisors I have."" Ruhumuriza is one of more 850 children who has passed through the village's 26 houses. But although the children of the genocide have grown up, many more come seeking refuge: those orphaned by accidents and disease. Refugees from Burundi. Children at risk of abuse. Ruhumuriza, which was also the name of Mukarusagara's murdered husband, has a special place in his foster mother's heart. ""Every time I saw him, I remembered my dead husband. He was as kind as my husband,"" she said with a sigh. ""At his wedding party, I will put on the best attire I have and sit next to his mother.""(This version of the story corrects spelling of name in paragraph one) (Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)"
5c79c86449f0eacbf105af6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/business/addictive-technology.html,"HALF MOON BAY, Calif. — See if you can get to the end of this article without being interrupted by another piece of technology.Tristan Harris, a former Google executive, said it could be a challenge, and he compared phones and apps to slot machines that command attention and endlessly distract.In an unusual twist, Mr. Harris discussed electronic addiction at the recent New York Times New Work Summit on a stage set with candles, as the electricity in the Half Moon Bay area had gone out.When Mr. Harris worked at Google in 2013, he created a 141-page slide show that acted as a reckoning for the internet giant. What was first shared with around 10 colleagues was later viewed by tens of thousands of employees and others.“Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25-35) working at 3 companies (Google, Apple, Facebook) had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention,” the slide show read.“Think about that for a second,” he wrote. “We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.”Seven years later, worries about the addictive nature of technology have multiplied. Apple and Google have introduced tools to try to help people better understand, and curb, their technology use.VideoMeredith Whittaker, AI Now Institute co-founder and co-director, speaking at The New York Times’s New Work Summit/Leading in the Age of A.I., said tech employees have a basic right to know the consequences of their efforts.CreditCreditMike Cohen for The New York TimesTop executives in Silicon Valley are increasingly voicing their concerns about technology’s influence on young minds. Apple’s Timothy D. Cook told The Guardian he didn’t want his nephew on any social platforms. Steve Jobs didn’t want his children near iPads. Some parents are asking nannies to shield children from their phones.“Compared to 20 or 30 years ago, technology is eating up every single area of public life,” Mr. Harris said in a conversation with Meredith Whittaker of the AI Now Institute and the reporter Nellie Bowles of The Times. “From our elections, to our media, to our culture, to our public sphere, to our conversations, to our children’s development — these are all areas of life that technology has gobbled up.”In 2016, he left Google to become a co-founder and the executive director of what is now known as the Center for Humane Technology, an organization that is calling for companies to build systems and business models “that more deeply align with our humanity and how we want to live.”Mr. Harris and Ms. Whittaker say the onus to create meaningful change in the technology world must come from within and outside of companies like Apple, Facebook, Google that have a large hand in creating the expanding attention crisis.As the lead of Google’s Open Research group and an A.I. researcher at New York University, Ms. Whittaker has a unique perspective on the issues and how they could be solved from within and beyond Silicon Valley.“People are recognizing that there are issues, and they want to change it,” Ms. Whittaker said. “But has the objective function of these corporations changed? They’re still major corporations at a time of neoliberal capitalism that are optimizing their products for shareholder value.”She continued to say that users and employees must demand accountability. But government regulation is also overdue, she said.“We need regulation,” she said. “Make them open up trade secrecy provisions so we can audit these systems when they are used in public life.”Ms. Whittaker proposed those regulations as part of the 2018 AI Now Report released by New York University in December. “Government regulation is an important component,” according to the report, “but leading companies in the A.I. industry also need internal accountability structures that go beyond ethics guidelines.”Ms. Whittaker and Mr. Harris said they believed employees within the tech industry want to see specific guidelines put in place.“We have allies throughout the whole industry because no one wants bad outcomes,” Mr. Harris said. No one wants to contribute to a system in which children have poor mental health, he added. “No one wants to contribute to a system where you destabilize democracies or cause genocides across the world.”Once employees see how the current structures can lead to such problems, they ask one question, he said: “How can I help?”"
5caea3c049f0eacbf1f828ba,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/10/sports/golf/ap-glf-masters.html,"AUGUSTA, Ga. — Rory McIlroy feels as prepared as ever for the Masters.He is spending more time with his nose in a book than with his hands on a putter. ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" by Og Mandino is among the best books he has read in the last year. He has been working with Brad Faxon on his putting, but their best sessions take place over a cup of coffee.His morning routine goes beyond stretching. There is juggling — yes, juggling — meditation and mind training.""I was watching the Women's Amateur over the weekend and I saw a few women on the range juggling, so it's catching on,"" McIlroy said Tuesday. ""How many balls can I juggle? Just three. I'm a rookie.""It's all geared toward becoming a complete person.And whether it makes him a complete player by capturing the only major he has yet to win, well, that would be a bonus.McIlroy is in the early stages of this process, and it's hard to argue with the results, even if results don't drive him like they once did. He has yet to finish out of the top 10 in his seven tournaments this year, which includes a victory at The Players Championship, the next best thing to a major.But that green jacket is a powerful pull on the mind, and McIlroy has reason to believe he can fit comfortably into one.He famously lost a four-shot lead with an 80 in the final round in 2011 but, even at age 21, showed enough resolve and enormous talent to win the U.S. Open in the very next major. He played in the final group on Saturday in 2016 with Jordan Spieth until falling back with a 77. He played in the final group Sunday last year with Patrick Reed, three shots behind, and fell out of the mix before reaching the back nine.""I know I've played well enough and I've shot enough good scores around here over the years that if I can put my best effort forward, I'm going to have a good chance to do well here,"" McIlroy said. ""But it's definitely different. My mind set is a little different in terms of ... I'm still practicing. I'm still getting better. I'm not getting ahead of myself, not thinking about the tee shot on Thursday or thinking about what is to come this week.""I would dearly love to win this tournament one day,"" he said. ""If it doesn't happen this week, that's totally fine, I'll come back next year and have another crack at it. But I'm happy with where everything is — body, mind, game.""No one was particularly happy with Mother Nature on Tuesday, as more storms arrived that shut the course down for about three hours in the morning and pounded an already soft Augusta National with rain before giving way to patches of sunshine in the afternoon.Wednesday is a short day of practice because of the Par 3 Tournament.The curtain raises Thursday with a host of players capable of getting in McIlroy's way of joining golf's most elite club. Only five other players have captured the career Grand Slam — Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.This is McIlroy's fifth crack at the Masters with a Grand Slam at stake. In the modern era of the Grand Slam that dates to 1960, no one went more than three years between the third and final leg.Phil Mickelson is in a similar situation, if not worse. He lacks only the U.S. Open — he has a record six silver medals — and is 0 for 4 since the Grand Slam has come into view. He also believes McIlroy's game is at a high level.""That's always a challenge when you put so much emphasis on playing a particular event, but it's also the chance to bring out your best,"" Mickelson said. ""And he's had such a phenomenal start to the year, he's been playing such great golf consistently week in and week out, I think contending will be a given. He'll be in contention. You just need those little breaks ... that push you over the winner's circle and that's probably all that he's waiting for this week.""You can't force it. It just has to happen.""The books McIlroy has been reading are recommendations from successful businesspeople. Along with Mandino's book, he liked Ryan Holiday's ""The Obstacle is the Way"" and ""Ego is the Enemy,"" and he's just now starting on the biography of Steve Jobs.In an interview at the Match Play, he was asked if he was spending more time on his golf or on his attitude.""Life,"" he said. ""I hit balls once last week. That was it. So much of this game is mental. It's taken me a while to get to this point, but the proof is there of what I've been doing, the way I've been playing, how I've been approaching the game.""So what happens if he's right in the mix Sunday afternoon, facing the most dynamic back nine in golf, the coveted green jacket there for the taking? What if that Sunday afternoon includes Woods, who eliminated McIlroy at the Match Play in a finish so irritating that McIlroy left without speaking to the media?""I haven't thought about it,' McIlroy said. ""I guess there's a lot of bridges to cross until we get to that point."""

Three years later Pixar debuted “A Bug’s Life” to critical acclaim, and 1999’s “Toy Story 2” was the biggest animated hit of the year.Concerned about resting on their laurels, the studio’s founders, Steve Jobs and Ed Catmull, hired the company’s first outside director, Brad Bird, to shake things up. Mr. Bird’s most recent film, “Iron Giant,” had flopped financially, and when he pitched his idea for a new movie to Pixar, he was told it would never work: It would take 10 years and cost $500 million to animate.But Mr. Bird persisted. He recruited a band of disgruntled people inside Pixar — misfits whose ideas had been ignored — to work with him. The resulting movie, “The Incredibles,” won two Oscars and grossed $631 million worldwide, outdoing all of Pixar’s previous successes. (And, for the record, it ended up costing less than $100 million to make.)We normally avoid frustrated people — we don’t want to get dragged down into a cesspool of complaints and cynicism. We see dissatisfied people as curmudgeons who halt progress, or, worse yet, Dementors who suck the joy out of the room. And we have good reason to feel that way: A natural response to frustration is the fight-or-flight response. Disgruntled people often go into “Office Space” mode, choosing to fight by sabotaging the workplace, or flight by doing the bare minimum not to get fired.But there’s a third reaction to frustration that we’ve overlooked: When we’re dissatisfied, instead of fight or flight, sometimes we invent.Frustration is the feeling of being blocked from a goal. Although it sounds like a destructive emotion, it can actually be a source of creative fuel. When we’re frustrated, we reject the status quo, question the way things have always been done, and search for new and improved methods. But there’s evidence that dissatisfaction only promotes creativity when people feel committed to their team and have the support they need to pursue their ideas.When Mr. Bird recruited disgruntled people at Pixar, he wasn’t just looking for angry animators.“I want people who are disgruntled because they have a better way of doing things and they are having trouble finding an avenue,” Mr. Bird told me. “Racing cars that are just spinning their wheels in a garage instead of racing.” He found people who were frustrated because they cared, and he started listening to them. Then he had a choice to make: Should he set an easy goal or a difficult one?[Like what you’re reading?

Very few people chose an easy distance, where they’d make more than half their shots. The vast majority preferred more difficult distances, where their odds were less than one-in-three. You’d expect this kind of self-challenge from overachievers, but even the less motivated people chose to stand farther away.Why?People tend to be surprisingly drawn to difficult goals. Decades of research show that extremely difficult, specific goals motivate us to work harder and smarter — again, as long as we’re committed and supported. Most of us prefer a task with a 50-50 shot of success over an easier one.Mr. Bird prefers even lower odds. He told his newfound flock of black sheep that everyone thought the task was impossible. They rose to the challenge, testing ideas that had never have been considered by the mainstream technicians and animators. Realizing that it would be too expensive and complicated to simulate water on a computer, they used a film of an actual swimming pool. Rather than design a flying saucer, they substituted a much simpler object — a pie plate. To animate the interlocking muscles of an entire family of superheroes, they used simple shapes like ovals sliding against one another.So don’t discount the misfits on your team. Find out why they’re frustrated and invite them to solve the problems they see. The results can be … incredible.Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton, is the author of “Originals.” For more on these ideas, listen to WorkLife with Adam Grant, a TED original podcast on the science of making work not suck.

5c8fd96f49f0eacbf105db26,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/arts/television/theranos-elizabeth-holmes.html,"The saga of the medical testing company Theranos and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, is a swirling one, packed with lies, greed, secret romance, literal blood, metaphorical blood, power, secrecy and money.And the Army. And science. And Walgreens. It’s a wild tale: Holmes was a 19-year-old Stanford student when she dropped out of school to launch Theranos, a company she said was developing a blood-testing device that could run hundreds of tests from just a finger-prick of blood rather than whole vials. But it couldn’t.The story of Theranos’s Silicon Valley rise and eventual total collapse — the company has dissolved, and Holmes was indicted on fraud charges — has lent itself to multiple retellings in various formats, including long-read articles, a meticulously researched book and a podcast, among others.Alex Gibney’s documentary “The Inventor: Out for Blood In Silicon Valley,” premiering Monday on HBO, is the latest account of the ostensible visionary who managed to deceive a lot of people (including two former secretaries of state). If you’re already deeply familiar with the story, certain points won’t come as a surprise: Holmes’s apparent fascination with Steve Jobs and Apple is mentioned constantly across all the retellings (her black turtleneck aesthetic especially), as is her deep voice, perhaps an affectation, even though it’s really only notable if it’s fake.But if you just can’t get enough of this Silicon Valley fraud, or don’t know where to begin, this is your guide to what to watch, read and listen to.The BeginningsIf you really want to go along for the full Theranos ride, start with the hagiographies, which together demonstrate just how easy it was for many in media to buy into Holmes’s persona and vision. Read the Fortune article from 2014, a Wired piece from 2014 or the New Yorker story from 2014 where Holmes, when asked to explain how a Theranos device actually works, said “a chemistry is performed.” She was on the cover of Forbes in 2014 as the youngest female self-made billionaire, and there’s also her Time 100 blurb from 2015 written by Henry Kissinger, a Theranos board member. She was on the cover of T Magazine, too, just before the scandal broke.The BiggieImageCreditAlfred A. Knopf“Bad Blood” is the real be-all end-all of Theranos information, and some of the other material on this list draws heavily from it. The Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou first broke the story of Theranos’s deceptions in 2015, and this comprehensive and fascinating book details every step in the company’s history and every step in his dogged reporting. “Bad Blood” is wild, and more happens on one page than in many other entire books. (There’s a Saddam Hussein cameo!)Beyond the staggering facts Carreyrou reports out, this is the only work here that really drives home just how long it took for the truth to emerge. At one point while I was tearing through the book, I thought I must be getting pretty close to the company’s collapse; then I tapped my Kindle and discovered I was only 23 percent of the way through.The PodcastImageCreditABC RadioThe six-part podcast “The Dropout,” produced by ABC Radio and ABC News’s “Nightline,” covers some of the same ground as “Bad Blood” and includes many of the same major players (including Erika Cheung, a former Theranos employee and one of the original whistle-blowers, and Carreyrou himself. The episodes wander a little — uh, Holmes always carrying papers around in high school does not seem like a particularly salient detail — but the portions that emphasize the legal side of things are quite juicy. “The Dropout” includes audio clips from depositions and spends a lot of time on the upcoming legal battles for Holmes and Theranos’s former president and chief operating officer, Ramesh Balwani, known as Sunny, who was also Holmes’s boyfriend. (On Friday, ABC also aired a “20/20” special of the same name.)The MovieImageA scene from “The Inventor.”CreditHBO“The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley” airs on HBO Monday at 9 p.m. While it, too, hits many of the same beats as “Bad Blood,” it also expands its scope a bit to examine the psychology of fraud, but in more specific (and compelling) ways than “The Dropout” does. The film’s director, Alex Gibney, also directed “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” “The Armstrong Lie” (about the disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong) and “Going Clear” (about Scientology), among other docs, and this zips along with calm expertise. The footage from a batch of Theranos promotional videos directed by Errol Morris might be able to bend time with the potency of its irony, as Holmes gazes right into the too-bright lights and chuckles that she doesn’t have any secrets. “The Inventor” also notes some of the dangers of handling blood — and that Theranos machines would be, you know, full of blood even if they did work great, which they did not.No, the Other MovieImageJennifer LawrenceCreditMario Anzuoni/ReutersJennifer Lawrence is set to star as Holmes in a feature-film version of “Bad Blood,” adapted by Vanessa Taylor (“The Shape of Water”) and directed by Adam McKay. The project was first reported in 2016 and is in development, but doesn’t have a release date yet. We’ll see!I Still Want MoreAccording to Vanity Fair, Holmes got a dog and named him Balto, and he peed in the Theranos offices."
5caf107e49f0eacbf1f82a7f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/bernie-sanders-wealth.html,"“I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” With those insouciant words, Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of the “millionaires and billionaires” he has vilified for most of his career.Condolences, senator.Sanders has plenty of company. In 2018 there were 10.23 million American households with a net worth of between $1 million and $5 million, not including their primary residence. That’s an increase of about 250,000 from 2017. Another 1.4 million households are worth between $5 million and $25 million, and 173,000 households are still north of that.Nor is Sanders alone in Congress, even — or especially — among Democrats. About half of all Senate Democrats in 2018 were millionaires. That includes Virginia’s Mark Warner (worth $90.2 million, according to Roll Call), Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal ($70 million), and California’s Dianne Feinstein ($58.5 million). At the time, Sanders’s net worth came to zero, a sum that was at least consistent with his worldview (though he did somehow manage to own three homes). But now he’s flush, and destined to pay higher taxes, so maybe his opinions will change. In his biography of Harry Truman, David McCullough noted that the 33rd president was shocked by how little money was left to him after he had to pay 67 percent of his hard-won earnings in state and federal taxes.With Sanders, I won’t get my hopes up. But his experience of sudden wealth ought at least to temper the hard and ugly edges of his class-war politics. Getting rich is not a form of theft. As often as not, it’s the result of a service. Being rich is not a sin. Typically, it’s the result of long labor, patient saving, prudent investment, gutsy risk-taking, and some stroke of originality.And becoming richer is no shame. Wealth and philanthropy tend to correlate. Of America’s 10 richest people, four have given away at least $1 billion and/or 20 percent of their net worth to charity. In terms of charitable donations by individuals as a percentage of G.D.P., the United States is by far the most generous, giving $410 billion to charity in 2017. The average American gives nearly twice as much to charity as the average New Zealander, the runner-up among giving nations. A Sanders supporter might concede some of this, while rejoining that great wealth is inherently corrupting (and unnecessary), and that great inequality is inherently dangerous to democracy (and just plain wrong). That’s the thinking that now animates the movement on the left to get rid of billionaires altogether, or at least cut them down to size with punitive taxation. Yet it’s never been clear why it’s immoral to be a billionaire but not a mere millionaire — other than, perhaps, the envy that those whose income is in the 95th percentile (college professors, for instance) tend to feel toward those in the 99th (finance people). Is there a consistent moral principle that distinguishes the relative goodness of five, six or even seven zeroes in your portfolio versus the badness of eight or a full nine?It’s also unclear how Steve Jobs’s or Bill Gates’s fortunes ever denied anyone a penny, except for the dollars voluntarily shelled out to purchase iPhones and Windows. In the U.S., billionaires don’t take wealth, as Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes, or Chinese officials do. They create it. And in creating it, they create jobs, opportunities, services, choice, equity, efficiencies, and sometimes even beauty — the reason why capitalist societies are invariably more attractive and dynamic than non-capitalist ones.Is this an argument for unregulated capitalism? No. Is it a claim that billionaires have superior virtues? No. Does it suggest that the uber-rich should have greater title to our political life than the rest of us? No. Does it mean we can only find earthly fulfillment through profit-maximization rather than joy-optimization?Come on.But the idea that people can be judged as individuals based on the economic class to which they belong is one of the foulest in history, matching if not exceeding in its murderous consequences the legacies of racism and colonialism combined. When Sanders inveighs against billyinaehs (millyinaehs being presumably no longer as odious to him today as they were just a few years ago) he is engaged in a form of stereotyping that is no less bigoted, or dangerous, for being aimed at so few.Still, I won’t give up all hope that Sanders might not come to see the error of his thinking. After leaving the U.S. Senate, the late George McGovern — Sanders’s precursor in many ways — decided he would try his hand in the world of business by operating an inn and restaurant in Connecticut. It didn’t go so well.“My business associates and I,” he wrote in a memorable 1992 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: ‘Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.’ It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators.”The op-ed began with a line from Justice Felix Frankfurter: “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.” For McGovern, wisdom came at the price of bankruptcy. For Sanders, maybe it will come with the rewards of wealth.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c8b780149f0eacbf105d387,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/college-admissions-fraud.html,"Scammers and cheats are the paradigmatic figures of our age, and not just because a con man is president of the United States. Again and again in recent years, people who’ve scaled the cultural heights have been revealed as audacious frauds. The systems and institutions that confer status in our society keep being exposed as Ponzi schemes. Grift is turning into our central national narrative.There are cons in every period — in the 2000s we had Enron, Bernie Madoff, and James Frey’s pseudo-memoir “A Million Little Pieces.” But there’s something distinct and era-defining about the current crop of high-profile scams. They hinge on the buying, selling and stealing of cultural capital, taking advantage of preconceived ideas of what success looks like. They’re made possible by the ephemerality of an economy where, to quote Ivanka Trump, heiress to a scamming dynasty, “If someone perceives something to be true, it is more important than if it is in fact true.”Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the biotech start-up Theranos, raised hundreds of millions of dollars by styling herself as a beautiful distaff Steve Jobs, a Stanford dropout who promised to disrupt the medical field. She incarnated an unattainably ascetic Silicon Valley ideal; as The New York Times T magazine once described her, “She only pauses in her work to run — seven miles a day.” Elites adored her — Bill Clinton interviewed her on stage at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2015, and Rupert Murdoch and Betsy DeVos invested in Theranos. But her company’s core technology didn’t work, and she’s now facing up to 20 years in prison on fraud and conspiracy charges. Her story is the subject of a best-selling book, a hit podcast and a feature film that’s set to star Jennifer Lawrence. A documentary directed by Alex Gibney premieres on HBO next week.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The Fyre Festival leveraged the modern malady of FOMO, or fear of missing out. Promoters used supermodels and social media influencers to sell packages that cost as much as $12,000 for what was supposed to be a highly Instagrammable music festival in the Bahamas. Attendees, expecting to show off pictures of themselves living like rock stars, arrived to find what looked like a soggy half-built refugee camp. The festival’s co-founder, Billy McFarland, has since been sentenced to six years in prison by a judge who called him a “serial fraudster.” It’s the subject of two recent documentaries.ImageInstead of the luxurious accommodations promised, Fyre Festival attendees found portable toilets.CreditJake Strang, via Associated PressThere are lots more. In a New Yorker piece last month, Dan Mallory, who wrote the best-selling thriller “The Woman in the Window” under the pseudonym A.J. Finn, was revealed to be a charming but highly manipulative fabulist who lied about having a Ph.D. from Oxford, among other things. (His book reportedly has striking similarities to a 1995 Sigourney Weaver movie called, amazingly, “Copycat.”) Anna Delvey — whose real name is Anna Sorokin — posed as a rich woman planning to open a chic arts club and wormed her way into New York society before being indicted for scamming hundreds of thousands of dollars from acquaintances and hotels. Shonda Rhimes is making a Netflix series based on her story.And now, the high-profile fraudster who has captured the country’s attention is William Singer, who masterminded — and then helped the F.B.I. expose — the college cheating scandal that has swept up famous actresses, wealthy executives and athletic coaches.Fittingly, it seems that Singer once aspired to make a reality TV show about the college admissions process, which he called, on a 2010 audition tape obtained by TMZ, a “game.” He recognized that the players aren’t high school students, but rich parents who are competing against their friends. Singer described how parents would call him frantically on Sunday morning, after Saturday night dinner parties where they heard all about the accomplishments of their friends’ kids.RelatedMore from The Times on our age of grifters:Fyre Festival, Theranos and Our Never-Ending ‘Scam Season’Jan. 30, 2019Why Are We Suddenly Surrounded by ‘Grift’?Dec. 4, 2018Opinion | Maureen Dowd: Grifters Gone WildMay 26, 2018Among the many reasons this scandal is so fascinating and so maddening is that it reveals the college admissions process itself as something of a con. Families across the country gear their lives toward a competition to help their children secure a spot in a top college, and hopefully a foothold in the meritocracy. Adolescence becomes, for many, a grind of test-taking and extracurricular activities that leaves kids anxious and exhausted. But poor and middle-class students are playing a game that’s rigged in favor of richer families who wield countless advantages, only the most of extravagant of which are illegal.If they get in to selective colleges, those who aren’t rich often take out giant student loans that will burden them throughout their adulthood. And for what? Education is a priceless thing, but in most cases that’s not really what the elite college competition is about.The point is a very specific kind of exchange. Smart kids get to make connections with kids whose parents bought their way in, helpful since the rich kids are the ones who are likely to end up with power in the wider world. Rich kids learn to act smart. They all get a credential that entitles them to a higher place in the social hierarchy than they might have otherwise. In a highly stratified country, social mobility can be a confidence game.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5ca5030e49f0eacbf1f80a99,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/opinion/apple-steve-jobs.html,"The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s spendy new campus in Cupertino, Calif., is a majestic temple to pomp. An ethereal glass-and-marble cylinder set high on a serene hill, the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co-founder’s famous “reality-distortion field.” It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr. Jobs, smirking joyfully, would bound up to the stage, teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future.And so it was meant to go once more last week, when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as “a Think Different production.”Some different thinking did seem in order. Since becoming the first trillion-dollar corporation last summer, Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street. The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business, but more than a decade after its debut, pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one, and many customers see little reason to upgrade.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]So now, instead of selling better stuff to more people, Apple’s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people. “Today is going to be a very different kind of event,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, taking the stage.It was not. From start to finish, Apple’s affair was a brushed-aluminum homage to sameness — a parade of services that start-ups and big rivals had done earlier, polished with an Apple-y sheen of design and marketing. Among other offerings, Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card, and it offered vague details about a still-in-development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey (who are not exactly edgy or up-and-coming).None of these efforts look terrible. Some, like the news service, might be handy. Yet they are all so trifling and derivative. As the analyst Ben Thompson noted, Apple’s crush of me-too announcements falls far short of Mr. Jobs’s goal of putting “a ding in the universe.” As I watched Apple’s event, I felt the future shrink a little. In its gilded middle age, Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand, stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing, a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook.In an ordinary time, such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine. But these aren’t ordinary times, and Apple is no ordinary company. Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire, the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine. Under Mr. Cook, Apple has cannily avoided every minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years, winning a windfall from President Trump’s tax cut, avoiding getting burned in his trade war — all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth.We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age: Share Your StoriesFeb. 13, 2019Yet, all around Apple, the digital world is burning up. Indirectly, Apple’s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction, the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy. None of these grand problems is Apple’s fault, but given its centrality to the business, Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them. But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future, Apple is shrinking from it.Consider privacy. Mr. Cook is one of the tech industry’s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information, and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations — which is just about the least Apple could do. But what if it thought a little bigger? For example, it could directly take on Google and Facebook — the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism — by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion, or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone. (Google will pay Apple an estimated $12 billion in 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone.)More than restricting the present, Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future. In particular, I wonder why Apple isn’t working feverishly to create new privacy-minded versions of social-media services the world needs.Take messaging, for starters. There is a strong moral case for Apple to turn iMessage, its encrypted messaging app, into an open standard available to anyone, even Android users, who currently lack many privacy-minded messaging apps that aren’t run by an ad company or aren’t friendly with the Chinese government.There might be a business case, too. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, recently reoriented his company toward messaging. As Will Oremus noted in Slate, the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple. This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one; Apple could swiftly undercut Mr. Zuckerberg’s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non-Apple world.RelatedOpinion | Cal NewportSteve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like ThisJan. 25, 2019Here are some other big ideas: Apple could embark on a long-term project to create a privacy-minded search engine to rival Google’s. It could build an ad-free Instagram (its founders just left Facebook in frustration). It could create a YouTube that isn’t a haven for neo-Nazis. Some (or many) of these may be dumb ideas — ideas that would ruin Apple, or at the very least kneecap its short-run profits. But they are at least big ideas; they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do. Let other companies handle streaming entertainment.

5c7feede49f0eacbf105ba31,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/opinion/what-happens-to-a-magazine-deferred.html,"John Belushi threw me into the air.In memory, I soar a good 20 feet over his head, as if I have been launched in some coked-out version of the blanket toss.It’s spring of 1981. I’m 23 years old, a closeted trans woman and the managing editor of The American Bystander magazine.I want to tell you about The Bystander, but this story isn’t only about that. You read a lot about people — Steve Jobs, say, or the Wright brothers — whose harebrained schemes transformed the world. It’s less common, though, to read about dreams deferred, ideas that were either ahead of their time or — who knows? — just plain crazy. Jimmy Dean’s Chocolate Chip Pancakes and Sausage on a Stick, for instance. Frito-Lay’s fat-free potato chips (that also acted as a laxative). Pepsi A.M. — the “breakfast cola.” Or The American Bystander magazine, which produced one issue and died.But the value of a dream shouldn’t always be measured by whether or not it came true.Brian McConnachie, the founder, had been an editor at National Lampoon in the 1970s; he’d written for “SCTV” as well as “Saturday Night Live.” Another Lampoon vet, Rick Meyerowitz, wrote in his book “Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead” that Mr. McConnachie’s work “is well loved, here on earth and on his home planet.”The Bystander was imagined as a “grown-up Lampoon” or an “American Punch.” Reported pieces, edgy commentary, so edgy that you were never quite sure what was serious and what was humor. Mr. McConnachie put together quite a crew as the project’s benefactors: Mr. Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and Lorne Michaels, Harold Ramis and Michael O’Donoghue, along with some New Yorker cartoonists and other Lampoon alumni. And then there was precocious young me, fresh out of Wesleyan University, where I’d edited the campus newspaper, The Argus.In 1982, we produced our pilot issue, certain that this would change the world. But in this we were disappointed. The Reagan recession hit us hard, and our plans proved nugatory.Before The Bystander folded, though, it gave me lots of adventures. I reported on a monkey orphanage on Long Island; I interviewed an aggrieved woman who ran the Skunk Club, a support group for people in Manhattan who kept skunks as pets; I visited Hart Island, the city’s sad, windswept potter’s field. I did not know, as I stood there, that the bones of my grandfather lay at my feet.One time we figured out how to float the cartoonist Roz Chast across Brooklyn’s famously polluted Gowanus Canal, using weather balloons, and it seemed feasible — at least until we asked Ms. Chast if she’d be willing to participate in this caper, and she simply said: “Listen. I’m not doing that.”The magazine included a well of full-color comics, featuring a lovely dreamscape by M.K. Brown titled “A Dream of Consequence.” Its first line was, “A dream of consequence is hard to find; I always get the other kind.”The Bystander came and went. And then 36 years went by, real fast.In 2016, I read an article in The Times with the headline “Titanic Still Afloat: The American Bystander Publishes Second Issue.” “This is willfully re-launching the Titanic,” its new editor and publisher, Michael Gerber, wrote, “knowing full well it will sink.”As it turns out, the new Bystander has not sunk; it has thrived. Newsweek called it “the last great American humor magazine.” Subscription is per issue, via the Patreon crowdfunding app, and back issues are available through Amazon. Ten issues have been published; it’s a beautiful, hilarious magazine — very much what we always hoped the Bystander would become. This is in large measure because of Mr. Gerber’s hard work and genius, but it’s also because of the vision that Brian McConnachie had almost 40 years ago.One afternoon last spring, I walked into a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan that was hosting a publication party for the most recent issue. All around me were the writers and cartoonists I had once worked with. There was Sam Gross, sitting at a table with George Booth — both of them legends in the world of comics art. There was Ms. Chast, who did not regret for one moment backing out of the weather-balloon stunt. And there was Mr. Gerber himself, who welcomed me like I was his long-lost sister.I felt, at that moment, something like the old knight at the end of “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” who says, after over a thousand years of waiting, “I knew you’d come.”Mr. McConnachie, now living in Florida, wasn’t there. But his vision was everywhere.It occurred to me that sometimes a dream deferred does comes true. But you have to be patient, and not allow time and disappointment to break you.Afterward, I walked back out into the New York afternoon with my head spinning, feeling, against all odds, like I was 23 again, with all of the mysteries and heartaches of life yet to be revealed.I remembered the night that John Belushi had tossed me skyward. “Belushi just threw me in the air and caught me,” I said to Mr. McConnachie later.“Well, you’re lucky,” he replied, with a smile. “He doesn’t catch everybody.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c77114f49f0eacbf105a86a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/mwc-2019-5g-huawei.html,"BARCELONA, Spain — The Trump administration sent a delegation to Spain this week to make its case against the Chinese technology company Huawei at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows. But the event, called MWC Barcelona, ended up being favorable ground for the Chinese maker of telecom equipment. Of the more than 100,000 attendees and 2,400 companies at the event, most ignored the efforts by the United States to impose a ban against Huawei for security and surveillance risks. Instead, they chose to focus on the coming introduction of long-hyped next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G, not to mention new foldable smartphones, robots and other internet-connected devices.ImageThe Swedish company Husqvarna demonstrated a connected smart mower.ImageA 3-D body scanner at a stand by ZTE.For Huawei, the enormous conference provided a much-needed opportunity to make a show of force after months of being on the defensive about the American-led campaign. The company, accused of being an instrument of spying for the Chinese government, was ubiquitous in Barcelona. Huawei had the biggest and most popular booth, which looked like a sprawling indoor city that took up half of a convention hall. The booth featured a demonstration area for its new smartphones, an Instagram-ready digital pond, and a roaming robot. Its outdoor picnic area was catered with Iberian ham, Chinese meat buns, fresh fish and Mediterranean salads. Even the lanyards worn by conference attendees were Huawei-branded. ImageTesting virtual reality technology at the MWC in Barcelona, Spain.MWC Barcelona is akin in scope and hype to the annual CES show in Las Vegas, one of the world’s largest consumer electronics events. MWC Barcelona fills eight conference halls with loud, sensory-overloading booths from companies including Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, Microsoft, Nokia and Ericsson. While overwhelmingly male, the event is more diverse than most tech conferences, with people from countries around the world attending. Walking around you heard people speaking English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Italian and Arabic.ImageNorah Alshamsan, a digital communication specialist from Saudi Arabia, at the Saudi Telecom Company stand. “I expect to make people’s lives easier. I am particularly excited about the potential change on education, transportation and the internet,” she said.ImageLuca de Meo, the chief executive of Seat, presenting his company’s new smart car, called Minimo. “We want to be champions of connected cars,” he said.On Tuesday, after Huawei’s chairman, Guo Ping, used a keynote speech to give a full-throated defense of the company, it hosted one of the week’s biggest parties on the grounds of a stadium that was used during the 1992 Olympics. American officials were left to hold a hastily called news conference on Tuesday at a booth operated by the Spanish government. They didn’t present any new evidence against Huawei. The conference previewed many of the hottest mobile trends, particularly the capabilities of new hyperfast 5G networks. For years, the technology has had more promise than actual uses. Executives said the faster networks would debut this year, with wider adoption coming in 2020 and beyond. To show the utility of 5G, the Chinese company ZTE programmed a band of industrial robots to play piano and drums at the event to illustrate how the ultrafast networks can be used by heavy machinery. Flight simulators, car-racing games, drones and internet-connected beer kegs were also available for testing. ImageHuawei had the biggest and most popular booth, including an Instagram-ready digital pond.ImageCar-racing games, as well as flight simulators, drones and internet-connected beer kegs, were available for testing.Jonathan Davidson, a senior vice president at wireless equipment provider Cisco Systems, said 5G was ready for prime time, and would enable new applications in augmented reality, health care and industrial factories. “We’re now moving into an era where 5G has 10 times the amount of bandwidth available,” Mr. Davidson said. “That changes the equation.” ImageThe event is more diverse than most tech conferences, with people from countries around the world attending.ImageEven the lanyards worn by conference attendees were Huawei-branded.Makers of mobile phones are counting on 5G to ignite growth. Last year, smartphone sales fell for the first time since Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007. Long a reliable engine of growth in the tech industry, smartphone demand is now sputtering. People are holding on to their devices longer, and there aren’t many new markets where smartphones aren’t already prevalent. More than five billion people worldwide now subscribe to a mobile phone plan, according to GSMA, the industry trade group. VideoRobotics on display at MWC.Following Apple’s lead, many companies introduced new handsets at MWC Barcelona with prices that a few years ago would have seemed unfathomable. In Barcelona, Samsung showed its previously announced $2,000 Fold handset with a bendable display. Huawei has introduced a competing foldable device, called the Mate X, which will cost about $2,600 and be available around the middle of the year outside the United States. “People are demanding more from their phones,” said Maxime Guirauton, a marketing director for Samsung in Europe. “Innovation comes at a price.” ImageHewlett-Packard displayed research on plants growing in space missions.ImageAfter a speech at the T-Mobile display.Microsoft introduced a new augmented reality headset, HoloLens 2, which costs $3,500 and is targeted more at businesses than general consumers. People formed long lines to try the gear, including using the goggles in a demonstration to fix water-sanitation equipment. Google also had a large presence at the show, with its Android software powering the noteworthy new handsets unveiled in Barcelona. The internet company scattered people around the conference dressed in white jumpsuits to help show off the Google Assistant virtual assistant. Standing at the Samsung booth, Carolina Milanesi, an industry analyst with Creative Strategies, said it was hard to judge how new products introduced this week would fare with customers. Success for gadgets such as a foldable phone will depend on whether there are applications that people are eager to use. “That’s what’s going to determine whether this is a niche, a fad or mass market,” she said.

5c76f1c549f0eacbf105a802,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/opinion/amy-klobuchar-staff.html,"On June 26, 1940, as Britain was girding for the onslaught of the Luftwaffe after the fall of France, Clementine Churchill wrote her husband, Winston, an admonishing note.“There is a danger of your being generally disliked by your colleagues and subordinates because of your rough, sarcastic and overbearing manner,” she warned the prime minister, who was otherwise preoccupied by the prospect of imminent Nazi invasion, a scheming foreign secretary, a restive backbench, and the absence of material support from the United States.“I have noticed a deterioration in your manner, and you are not so kind as you used to be,” she continued. “It is for you to give the orders and if they are bungled — except for the King, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Speaker — you can sack anyone and everyone. Therefore with this terrific power you must combine urbanity, kindness and if possible Olympic calm.”Clementine concluded by citing a French proverb, “One can reign over hearts only by keeping one’s composure.” Winston got the message and found ways to make amends. As his private secretary, Jock Colville, later recalled, “When he was at No. 10 there was always laughter in the corridors, even in the darkest and most difficult times.”The Battle of Britain was not decided because Churchill chose to behave better. But given his indispensability at the moment of crisis, it might have been lost if he hadn’t won the confidence and love of those who made the victory possible.The subject of bad bosses is again in the news thanks to Amy Klobuchar, U.S. senator, Democratic presidential aspirant, and, as a recent story in the Times made clear, the living antithesis of whatever “Minnesota Nice” is supposed to be. She throws binders at underlings. She makes them wash her dishes. She suspects office moles. She attempts to sabotage the job prospects of those who want to resign. She reproaches her staff with her own self-pity.On a trip to South Carolina, forkless, she makes an aide wash her comb after she’s used it to eat a salad — but apparently not before.Though the senator has her defenders — 61 former staffers signed a public letter supporting her — the essential truth of The Times’s story is attested by the fact that for years she has had among the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate. Klobuchar admits to being “tough” and having “high expectations.” But the behavior described by The Times isn’t tough. It’s horrible.Anyone who’s had a horrible boss knows the difference between tough and horrible —between leaders who set high bars and those who administer petty humiliations. When I was young and new to journalism, my editor, a man who terrorized a succession of secretaries and whose eyebrows could sink the Titanic, called me into his office intent on chewing me out over a minor task he thought I hadn’t performed. Except that I had performed it. The memory of his crestfallen expression when he realized he would not be inflicting the clearly intended excoriation remains indelible.He was a man of great erudition and editorial skill. His work ethic was ferocious. But his journalistic career proved to be trivial. He inspired no loyalty and, for all of his talent, left no trace.Of course not all horrible bosses are failed leaders. Lyndon Johnson was horrible, but there was the Civil Rights Act. Steve Jobs was horrible (at least in his first incarnation at Apple), but there was the Mac. Anna Wintour’s horribleness is a matter of record and legend, but there were those fat September issues. Horribleness can be correlated with vision and perfectionism, just as niceness can be correlated with mediocrity and failure. Neville Chamberlain was well-liked by his colleagues and staff.Mainly speaking, though, horrible bosses make for leadership failures, for reasons that should be obvious.Office tantrums bespeak a broader absence of self-control: There’s a direct line between Bill Clinton’s infamous “purple fits” and the scandal that nearly wrecked his presidency. Suspiciousness undermines the trust necessary for effective leadership: Richard Nixon’s paranoia almost surely created more political enemies than it uncovered. High-handedness and jealousy drive away talent and ambition: Jamie Dimon, arguably the most talented C.E.O. of our day, was fired from Citigroup by Sandy Weill.And then there is Exhibit A in horrible boss behavior: the 45th president of the United States. The president’s usual apologists may defend his management habits as evidence of otherworldy genius, but Jim Mattis, John Kelly, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, and others who have worked closely with Donald Trump would probably tell a different story. And regardless of what you think of the administration’s policies, it’s impossible to think of any other White House in which the distempers of the man translated so directly to the incompetence of execution.This is where the question of Klobuchar’s temperament should most concern voters. Whatever else Americans may need in our next commander in chief, what we don’t need is an irascible executive running an administration along feudal lines, with the serfs made to pay the price. Calming the country requires calm at the top.It isn’t too late for Klobuchar, who in so many other respects has all the right qualifications to lead, to make amends. She can take Clementine Churchill’s wisdom to heart. She can call every staffer she’s wounded and tell them she’s sorry, that it wasn’t right, that she’ll never behave that way again.The statute of limitations on apologies never expires.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c97477549f0eacbf105ebd8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/reader-center/printing-plant-section-christopher-payne.html,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.To walk into any cavernously large space, to tour a cathedral or factory or cave, is to feel overwhelmed by your own smallness in comparison to what surrounds you. This is what it feels like to enter The New York Times’s printing plant in College Point, Queens, and look up to see papers whizzing by overhead on no fewer than 14 miles of conveyor belts. The scale of the plant seems comically oversized compared to the cramped bodegas and newsstands that we think of as our Sunday papers’ natural habitat. Some employees get around the plant on giant tricycles, so great are the distances between stations that it would waste too much time to cover them on foot.Christopher Payne, the industrial and architectural photographer whose last project for The Times Magazine’s Future of Work issue was about nine people who love their jobs, has made more than 40 trips over the last two years to photograph the College Point plant. Mr. Payne’s sense of wonder at what he found there is clear in his photo essay for this weekend’s special section, “The Daily Miracle,” which showcases his photos of the people, presses and metal plates that make The Times and deliver it around the city.“When Payne asked for access to photograph the printing plant, we said yes, because he was exactly the right person to photograph this,” Kathy Ryan, the director of photography for the Sunday magazine and NYT Magazine Labs, said of Mr. Payne. “He has a really impeccable eye for beauty. He can walk into a big, gritty, inky factory and see moments of the sublime. When he sees that paper coming rapidly over the roller, out of focus, it becomes an abstraction. That's the thing he does.”Mr. Payne’s appreciation of print started at an early age. When Payne was 13 years old, his first job was selling The Boston Globe at an intersection near South Station. “When the lights changed, I had to get out of the way so I wouldn’t be hit by the mirrors,” he said.He slung papers for two summers, and he lived near the Globe printing plant in Dorcester, too. “The building had a giant window facing the street, and when you drove by, you could see the presses running,” Mr. Payne said. “At night while the rest of the city slept, the pressroom was alive and lit up. To a kid it was like Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory: partly mysterious, partly reassuring.”Mr. Payne’s photographs at the College Point plant capture the blur of up to 80,000 newspapers per hour running through the factory — the daily New York Times, and other papers including USA Today and AM New York.Caitlin Roper is the editorial director of NYT Mag Labs, which she describes as being able to play between a magazine and a newspaper. The labs’ special broadsheet sections include the monthly Kids section, long-form fiction excerpts and more, and they are always experimenting with what’s possible in newsprint. “This is a hilariously meta version of that,” she said — with the plant’s behind-the-scenes role taking center stage.Ms. Roper asked the writer and critic Luc Sante, whom she calls a “detective historian of New York,” to pen the section’s introductory essay. In an unexpected turn, before he had seen the finished product himself, Mr. Sante received an email from a worker at a subsidiary printing plant who had read the essay while separating plates for the section.

It’s not so much about staying up-to-date, it’s about taking in the information, the weight of the information, and what’s important.”On a (very) recent visit, Mr. Payne watched “The Daily Miracle” section itself being spun off the rollers. He doesn’t believe print will last forever. “There were guys in the pressroom who were watching photos of themselves being printed,” he said, “They have been working there for 20, 30 or more years, and this was the first time they were honored in this way.”Ms. Ryan, our director of photography, said that sharing these photographs of the paper in The Times itself with our readers felt right. “We wanted to print this because we felt readers would love it as much as we do.

5c8b69ee49f0eacbf105d360,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/learning/how-should-parents-talk-to-their-children-about-drugs.html,"Have your parents ever talked to you about drugs? What did they say? What questions did they ask? Who initiated the conversation? Were the discussions helpful? Welcomed? Embarrassing? Enlightening?In “How to Talk to Your Kids About Drugs When Everyone Is Doing Them,” David Hochman writes:The assignment was to write a four-page research paper on any biology topic. My son, Sebastian, is a high school freshman, and it was his first real chance to shine. I expected him to pick something like photosynthesis. He went with psychedelic drugs instead.Let me tell you what would have happened if I had made that choice as a ninth-grader: I would have been grounded until graduation. In northeastern Pennsylvania, where I grew up, my mother worked for the county commission on drug and alcohol abuse, and she could literally smell stoned people. The breath of a pothead, she warned, as if hunting dragons, has the odorousness of burned rope.One night she shook me awake after finding a tiny tube of Krazy Glue under the seats of her Buick Skyhawk.“Are you sniffing this stuff to get high?” she said.I wasn’t. I didn’t even know that was a thing. I cried.In my mom’s defense, the narc approach was more common back then. In 1984, when I was in high school, Nancy Reagan first uttered the phrase “Just say no” after a student asked what to do if friends offered her funny cigarettes. Later, the public ad campaign “This Is Your Brain on Drugs” made us believe our teenage minds would be fried — sunny side up — if we even thought about weed.The article continues:My struggle is to update the proactive messaging for the age of the legal buzz. I don’t care that every other billboard in Los Angeles makes casual drug use look as harmless as hailing a Lyft; I don’t want my child messing with his still-developing brain and body. I don’t want him self-medicating to escape. I definitely don’t want him Juuling, snorting, dosing or dabbing while driving. I also don’t want to wait until his grades tank, and I catch him gorging on raw cookie dough and “Dark Side of the Moon” before stepping in. (I know this makes me sound very old-fashioned.)That’s why I created “prehab.”If rehab is a way to recover from drug addiction, prehab is a program designed (by me, at least) to avert the whole mess in the first place. It’s like pulling a Marty McFly with your future party self, pre-empting poor decisions way before you’re drunk texting your ex and sleeping through Mondays. So I enrolled Sebastian as the test case.Eventually the author comes to question his prehab creation:I made a dad joke about not lighting up, but Sebastian wasn’t laughing. He looked at me and said, “I actually understand everything you’re telling me. If it makes any difference to you, I’m not really interested in trying drugs. But that could change someday. I really don’t know. For now, can we be done talking about this?”It hit me in that moment that Sebastian wasn’t the one needing prehab. I was. I’d been so focused on finding the formula for guiding him down the right path that I forgot that he’s the only one who can make these decisions. My task isn’t to steer him around every bong and backyard keg gathering for the rest of his childhood. It’s to be there for him, to set basic guidelines. I also want to support him in figuring out what he truly enjoys, what he dreams about for his future, what he needs more of — and less of — from me. I’d do anything to help him make the most of this one shot he’s got.Above all, prehab is about letting go. I can talk to Sebastian about drugs until the psychedelic cows come home but I can’t control his future, and why would I want to? Even if he ends up experimenting, I need to have the faith that he’ll be fine. Would it have done John Lennon’s father any good to worry about his kid’s toking habits? Would I be typing on this Apple computer if Steve Jobs just said no to LSD?Students, read the entire article, then tell us:— How should parents talk to their children about drugs, alcohol and tobacco? What do you think are the most and least effective ways parents can talk to their children about this issue? Why?— How have your parents talked to you about drugs? Were these conversations effective or helpful? How open and honest were they? Did your parents take the “narc approach” Mr. Hochman ascribes to his mother? Or did they try more of the “prehab” approach Mr. Hochman used with his son?— Do you feel comfortable turning to your parents with questions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco? Do you think it is easier to talk to parents about drugs now versus when your parents were growing up?— What conversation do you wish you could have with your parents about drugs?— What do you think of Mr. Hochman’s advice to parents? Do you think parents need to let go and have faith that their children will be fine? Or do they need to provide direct teaching, guidance and rules around drugs?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

5c75ad1e49f0eacbf105a4b9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/health/boss-bullies-workplace-management.html,"Senator Amy Klobuchar’s nascent campaign is fending off a stream of stories from former staffers that she was a volatile, highhanded boss who often demeaned and humiliated people who worked for her. She has one of the highest rates of turnover in the Senate.“Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,” she said in a recent CNN forum. “Have I pushed people too hard? Yes.”The presumption that tough bosses get results — and fast — compared with gentler leaders is widespread, and rooted partly in the published life stories of successful C.E.O.s. Bobby Knight, the Indiana University basketball coach and author of “The Power of Negative Thinking,” was notoriously harsh, and enormously successful. So was Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple.But researchers who study organizations, productivity and leadership styles attribute the achievements of such figures to exceptional ability. The research thus far has found no evidence to support the axiom that tougher bosses get better results.“We’ve been looking for it,” said Rebecca Greenbaum, a professor in Rutgers University’s school of management and labor relations, who formerly worked in the insurance industry. “We’d love to find out if there are good aspects of abusive leadership. There’s been a lot of research. We just can’t find any upside.”The study of leadership style has blossomed in the last decade. Psychologists, business analysts and organization experts have conducted all kinds of investigations, from anonymous surveys of employees to studies of worker behavior over time. Various measures of productivity, performance and well-being have been called upon.By nature, any study of group dynamics in a real-world setting is plagued by design limitations, including the lack of a control group and the hidden personal grievances of the employees. But the vast majority of findings point to the same conclusion: Bullying bosses tend to undermine their own teams. Morale and company loyalty plunge, tardiness increases and sick days are more frequent.“Productivity may rise in the short term,” Dr. Greenbaum said. “But over time the performance of the staff or team deteriorates, and people quit.”In Ms. Klobuchar’s case, any discussion of leadership style invites suspicion of a double standard based on gender. That double standard certainly exists; in many situations, male leaders are given greater leeway to be tough.“People judge women very harshly, even if they do the same behaviors as a man,” Leigh Thompson, director of team and group research at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said in an email. “As for Amy K., my guess is that if she were Andy K., well, he’d be considered tough but he gets things done.”ImageAlthough some reports of Senator Amy Klobuchar’s volatile leadership style have raised suspicion of sexism, researchers say women are no less likely than men to be abusive as bosses.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesStill, women are no less likely than men to be abusive as bosses, across all levels of management, although they are slightly more likely to be targets of workplace abuse, researchers find.If an abusive management style provides so little benefit, then why do so many abusive managers and bosses rise in organizations? One clue comes from social psychologists who have studied how teams of people behave and solve problems in the absence of a hierarchy.Leaders tend to emerge organically, and common traits of those who assume the role include boldness, a healthy ego and a sense of entitlement. Confidence, too: People who take charge in these simulations tend to be decisive, making calls from the gut, and quickly.A series of studies led by Jennifer Overbeck, an associate professor of management at Melbourne Business School, has found that, in simulated work groups, people gave high ratings to leaders who made quick decisions, particularly in moral dilemmas. It’s not that snap decisions were correct more often than deliberate ones. Rather, they were perceived to be more correct, and the decision maker seemed more morally assured than other potential leaders.People tend to give individual leaders the benefit of the doubt, at least for a time. Dr. Overbeck calls this tendency the “leader’s rosy halo.” The presumption is strong enough that people in power “do not need to be transparent regarding their decision-making processes to be seen as moral and to receive support from their subordinates,” Dr. Overbeck wrote in a journal article.As these individuals rise through the ranks, they internalize the belief that they are natural, morally instinctual leaders. This belief, in turn, affects how they view the people under them.In a 2013 study, Dr. Overbeck and Vitaliya Droutman of the University of Southern California randomly assigned 50 students to groups, to be managers or team members. The researchers administered a series of standard tests to gauge how the participants judged their own traits and others’.The managers were aware of their own personal strengths and weaknesses, but also concluded that their staff members “shared their negative, but not their positive, traits and feelings.” That is, managers often misread team members’ emotions as being in line with their own — “She’s as frustrated with herself as I am” — even though this often is not the case.“We argue that when someone powerful is in a group, they see themselves as representative of that group, and it can be difficult for them to disentangle what the group wants from what they want,” Dr. Overbeck said in a phone interview. “They use themselves as a reference point.”Abusive supervisors come in many flavors, including the insecure, the overmatched and the garden-variety sadist who picks on underlings solely for the pleasure of exercising power. But even mini-tantrums and put-downs can be counterproductive, undermining the efforts of a normally civil person and an otherwise effective boss.“What our findings suggest is that this kind of behavior is typically not premeditated,” Dr. Greenbaum said. “It comes out when people fail to control themselves, and it is worse when supervisors have a bottom-line mentality — that they’ll do anything to achieve their goals.”A boss who “demands” excellence is no more likely to produce it than the boss who requests or nurtures it, and likely less so, the research suggests. Demanding excellence often is just a handy excuse, said Bennett Tepper, a leading researcher of the effects of abusive leadership at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business:“That kind of explanation, after the fact — that I hold people accountable — it’s lame. Well, me too. A lot of us do. That doesn’t mean we belittle people and scream at them.”"
5c2e756f3a125f5075c02baf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/apple-revenue-china-innovation.html,"If anything, MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It’s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed — the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue of Ember magazine and, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. “Let’s be buds” urges a sign on one table.It certainly looks like it’s going great at this chain of weed dispensaries. But — like a lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in California — MedMen is struggling. The latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed a net loss of $66 million on revenues of $21.5 million. It had lost $79 million the previous quarter.Not enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMen’s problems, but the disconnect between the company’s promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week: Apple’s announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Apple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes. It is, to use an old California trope, going to be a real bummer for Silicon Valley.Now stick with me here, because what’s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?Apple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook. He, of course, was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs, who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in 1997. Since then, it has been all uphill, to the point this summer when Apple reached a $1 trillion valuation — the first publicly traded American company to reach that high — with a price of $207.39 a share.ImageAn Apple Store in Grand Central Terminal in New York.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesToday it’s trading at $142.64, and analysts are predicting it will settle around $135. Yipes. Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China, where Apple products are popular, and the Trump administration’s trade war. But as Ina Fried of Axios noted: “The problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple. But Apple’s iPhone problems extend far beyond China, too.”Indeed. The last big innovation explosion — the proliferation of the smartphone — is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a “Cambrian explosion,” a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify. Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.Apple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.That business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don’t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it’s apparent that it’s now winding down.This is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward. The last cool set of companies — Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and, yes, Tinder — were created many years ago, and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising.Well, rental scooters. O.K., they’re cool, but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now. How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.Where is that next spark that will light us all up?Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

5c6875303a125f5075c0a17a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/obituaries/patrick-caddell-dead.html,"Patrick Caddell, the political pollster who helped send an obscure peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter to the White House, later became disillusioned with fellow Democrats and finally veered right to advise supporters of Donald J. Trump, died on Saturday in Charleston, S.C. He was 68.His death, from complications of a stroke, was confirmed by a colleague, Prof. Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston.While Mr. Caddell was considered instrumental in Mr. Carter’s victory in 1976, he also shared the blame for limiting him to a single term. He helped persuade the president to deliver a speech that was intended to inspirit the nation during an energy crisis and economic slump, but instead tarred Mr. Carter as a weakling who was unable to lift the country out of its malaise.Instead, in 1980 voters chose Ronald Reagan, a Republican who promised a rosier vision that he would describe during his successful re-election campaign as “morning again in America.”In fact, Mr. Carter never mentioned the word “malaise” in his 1979 address to a nation fed up with endless lines at gas stations, inflation and joblessness. And his solemn jeremiad bemoaning the “crisis of the American spirit” when “human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns” was initially well received.But it turned out that the crisis of confidence was in Mr. Carter’s ability to get the country going again and to revive it from its malaise — a description that Clark M. Clifford, a presidential adviser, had invoked before the speech.By the late 1980s, Mr. Caddell had become disaffected with the Democratic Party, but his advice to candidates remained largely consistent, the same as it was for Jimmy Carter when, running as an outsider in 1976, he said “I’ll never lie to you” and promised “a government as good as its people.”That message, whether it applied to Mr. Carter or to Donald Trump in 2016, was to appeal to the expanding pool of voters alienated from Washington.Scott Miller, a colleague who developed the political research site WeNeedSmith.com, said that many people would not miss Mr. Caddell’s “needling and nettling,” but “the fact is, political calm made Pat very uneasy.”“That calm means that the cement of the status quo is hardening, that the inevitable corruption of power is taking deeper root, that incumbent complacency is turning overripe on the vine,” Mr. Miller said in an email. “This drew him to the change leaders: to George McGovern, to Jimmy Carter, to Gary Hart, to Steve Jobs, to Ross Perot and eventually to Donald Trump.”In 2016, he became a frequent commentator on Fox News and advised Stephen K. Bannon, who became President Trump’s chief White House strategist, and Robert Mercer, a computer mogul and contributor to the Trump campaign.ImageMr. Caddell, far left, in a 1976 meeting with Jimmy Carter. While still in college, Mr. Caddell did polling for the presidential primary campaign of Senator George S. McGovern.CreditAssociated PressAs early as 1987, William Schneider, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, called Mr. Caddell “the living American with the most direct experience in presidential campaigns, except for one, Richard Nixon.”Patrick Hayward Caddell was born on May 19, 1950, in Rock Hill, S.C. His mother was Janie (Burns) Caddell. His father, Newton P. Caddell, was a Coast Guard chief warrant officer. Patrick grew up near various Coast Guard stations, spending most of his youth in Falmouth, Mass., and Jacksonville, Fla., where he attended parochial high school and also began taking his first public opinion surveys.“Math was not my favorite subject,” he said, but at 16, for a mathematics project in his junior year, he fashioned a “voter election model” of the Jacksonville area for predicting elections based on early returns.“I set up at the courthouse and called all the elections early with great abandon, with no idea what I was doing,” he said. “And they all turned out right.”That was the extent of his formal academic training in public opinion research.He was still an undergraduate at Harvard, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science in 1972 and started a thesis on “the changing South,” when he started polling professionally for Senator George S. McGovern’s fledgling presidential primary operation.McGovern lost to President Nixon in a landslide; Mr. Caddell’s political acumen and polling expertise, translating data into tactical strategy, were among the few creditable outcomes of the campaign.He established his own firm, Cambridge Survey Research, to conduct political campaigns. Although he spun off another company, Cambridge Reports, to advise corporate clients, he was criticized for capitalizing on his Washington connections — representing, among other clients, nuclear energy companies and the Saudi Arabian government — especially when, during the Carter administration, he became known as the president’s pollster.Campaign staffs are not known for sharing credit, but in June 1976, when Mr. Carter had secured the Democratic nomination, his campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, confidently told a reporter: “You know why Jimmy Carter is going to be president? Because of Pat Caddell — it’s all because of Pat Caddell.”Mr. Jordan said that in helping Mr. Carter defeat Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in the Florida primary, Mr. Caddell had reaffirmed the campaign’s overall strategy but had also pinpointed where to concentrate its resources.Before Mr. Carter was inaugurated in January 1977, Mr. Caddell advised him to stick to broad themes and issued a warning: “Too many good people,” he wrote in a 56-page memo, “have been beaten because they tried to substitute substance for style.”Mr. Caddell is survived by a daughter, Heidi Caddell Eichelberger; a brother, Daniel; a sister, Patricia Roberts; and three grandchildren.As a Harvard government major, Mr. Caddell understood that democracy and politics could sometimes conflict. He was quoted in “The Permanent Campaign” by Sidney Blumenthal as saying that Reagan’s tightly regulated contacts with the news media in his 1980 campaign set a model.“I would never be involved in another presidential campaign where the candidate was openly accessible to the press,” Mr. Caddell said. “As a campaign operative, this makes it easier for me. As an American citizen, I shudder to think what people like me would do. It’s terrible for the country.”"
5c82944e49f0eacbf105c144,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/facebook-privacy-snapchat.html,"If you want to know why Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly so interested in privacy, I have one word for you: data.“Mark makes decisions based on data and not values,” a person familiar with Facebook’s inner workings said when I asked about the chief executive’s stunning about-face this week on the new trajectory of the social media industry he pretty much founded.I would bet a lot that Mr. Zuckerberg saw the data I have seen that shows that the future is not looking good for the bloated, oversharing, fake-news-spewing, Russian-infected big blue app that made him both rich and powerful and, now, quite vulnerable.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]And what do those numbers say? Well, first and foremost that social media is in big trouble with the young and that it is long past time for it to shift to a privacy-oriented stance that was never part of its DNA, except perhaps as a throwaway line in a news release.While Facebook has always insisted otherwise, its commitment to protecting the information of users has been weak at best since its very founding. But now Mr. Zuckerberg has written a blog post — with not one single trace of irony and with nary a mention of the many privacy abuses he has presided over — announcing that the company would be betting big on private messaging and protected communications for its billions of users.You know, like Snapchat, but on a Facebook scale.Over the years, Facebook has swiped many nifty ideas from Snapchat, the ephemeral messaging platform — which Mr. Zuckerberg actually tried to buy many years ago when it was still a start-up. That has been especially true at the Facebook-owned Instagram, which did a wholesale shoplift of Snapchat’s Stories by creating … wait for it … Instagram Stories!In a podcast interview with me, the Instagram co-founder and former chief executive Kevin Systrom did not even bother to hide the act. He said that he admired the creativity of Evan Spiegel, the Snapchat founder, and that taking a good idea and making it better was a thing that always happened in tech. He compared the Stories feature to a car radio that Instagram had simply improved on. Indeed it did, and it has been a huge hit for Facebook.That’s fair enough, I guess. But this time Mr. Zuckerberg is pilfering so much more, sketching out a future business that looks a lot like Snapchat, with a little bit like China’s WeChat mixed in. And, mostly, not at all like Facebook.The big takeaway is that the penny has finally dropped with Mr. Zuckerberg that messaging and social media are very different to users, as much as he has tried to force them into an unholy mush.All you would have to do to figure that out is ask my 16-year-old. But I recently saw some internal Snapchat data that drove this message home using data from both Snapchat and Facebook Ad Managers. It showed that Snapchat ads reach more 13- to 24-year-olds in the United States than ads on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined. Among 13- to 17-year-olds, the delta is even wider.Even if those are Snapchat stats, it is clear that the young demographic that Facebook covets doesn’t much care about public sharing via posting. If it did, would Mr. Zuckerberg have seen the need to make this announcement? He would not, since the ad-heavy Facebook bulletin board is still a huge moneymaker, and it’s much harder to make such scratch from a business focused on private messaging.That has been one of the problems of Snapchat, which is much smaller than Facebook — as well as internal missteps caused by a rotating series of managers and strategies.We want to hear from youOpinion: Losing Your Privacy in the Digital Age: Share Your StoriesFeb. 13, 2019But Mr. Spiegel’s idea — that people care a lot about privacy and don’t want the information they upload to be sold like a Christmas pig — remains a stellar one. Ironically, Mr. Zuckerberg may turn out to be the one who can make it profitable.So indulge me for a minute with a comparison: Mr. Zuckerberg is to Bill Gates as Mr. Spiegel is to Steve Jobs.Mr. Jobs always had better ideas and vision than Mr. Gates. But Apple spent a long time in dire straits while he pushed his high-level concepts about security, privacy, and design and simplicity.Mr. Gates, on the other hand, was an unqualified genius at business models and systems, and he clearly understood the depressing truth that good enough was good enough for a lot of consumers. Of course, Mr. Jobs’s stunning creativity eventually won out, with the advent of the iPod, which was soon followed by the iPhone, and, well, the rest is history. Mr. Gates and his No. 2 at Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, scoffed at the efforts of Apple before trying to backpedal furiously. It did not work.Remember the Microsoft Zune? Me neither.In a podcast interview last year, Mr. Zuckerberg name-checked Mr. Gates as an important mentor, and he has obviously learned well. He has already shown a talent for turnarounds, shifting the company from desktop to mobile in one of the most impressive management moves in tech history. While he stumbled at first by doing a Facebook phone (I don’t remember that either!), the deft Mr. Zuckerberg quickly recovered and the company has never looked back.And now this, a chance to leave behind all the headaches that come with running an enormous public platform. As I have said before, Facebook is like a megapolis, presided over by Mr. Zuckerberg. Managing it is hard, because it needs a strong police force and competent people to pick up the garbage and working sewers, and there are bad people all over the place. While the growth of this city, let’s call it ZuckTown, has been impressive, it has also been sloppily managed in ways that have hurt society.Maybe the Facebook of the future will be different. That could be a very good thing for the world, and I’m glad that Mr. Zuckerberg seems to have decided that the map laid out by Snapchat is the one to go with — even if he didn’t give Snapchat any credit for it. One person I spoke with likened Mr. Zuckerberg to a captain who has decided not to go down with a ship that has sprung some serious leaks: “He’s just going to jump to another ship rather than fix the first one. And keep on going.”I guess there is not much else to say but: Godspeed, Mark.RelatedOpinion | Zeynep TufekciZuckerberg’s So-Called Shift Toward PrivacyMarch 7, 2019Elizabeth Warren Proposes Breaking Up Tech Giants Like Amazon and FacebookMarch 8, 2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c5dd9e63a125f5075c08c6f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/opinion/bezos-national-enquirer-blackmail.html,"I cannot quite believe I am writing about Jeff Bezos’ sex life for the second time in two weeks, let alone about his penis. But Mr. Bezos brought all of himself back into the news on Thursday by writing a blockbuster post on Medium accusing American Media, which owns The National Enquirer, of blackmail. The post is addressed to David Pecker, the head of American Media, and titled, “No Thank You, Mr. Pecker.”Pun presumably intended by Mr. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chief executive. It’s difficult to not descend into a minefield of them (Jeff Bezos’ Prime and Jeff Bezos’ package are popular jokes on Twitter today, and HuffPost and The New York Post ran with “Bezos Exposes Pecker”) and conclude that it is simply a field day for tabloids.More from the writer on this story.Opinion | Kara SwisherThe Sexts of Jeff Bezos and the Death of PrivacyJan. 18, 2019This is true on a superficial and titillating level, of course. Last month, The National Enquirer broke the story about Mr. Bezos’ affair and quoted awkward and somewhat sweet sexts he had sent his girlfriend. There were also insinuations about the existence of photos of his penis. But now the news is about something bigger. By using a digital platform to bring his side of the story directly to the masses, Mr. Bezos has done something both admirable and also a little scary. Most revealing — and I say this about a story that is lousy with revelations — is that it is perhaps the best illustration of the in-your-face aggressiveness that has made him the richest man in the world and arguably the most important tech visionary since Steve Jobs.I am not sure even Mr. Jobs, the pugnacious Apple founder and chief executive who mastered the media, would have tried to pull off what Mr. Bezos has done.[Kara Swisher answered your questions on Twitter.]It was unclear how The National Enquirer got hold of this trove of obviously confidential material, but it did. So Mr. Bezos — who is “a person of means,” to use Howard Schultz’s favored term — decided to use his considerable assets to find out. And why not? The digital invasion is troubling enough personally, but a high-profile businessman like Mr. Bezos has a lot of critical company secrets he needs kept that way.While what happened to him could have been as simple as someone snapping a photo of a text or photo and passing it along, it might have been much worse. The Washington Post, owned by Mr. Bezos, is reporting that his investigators think he could have been hacked by a government agency, which would be extremely troubling. But whether he was hacked, or there was a broader security breach, in this leaky internet age, it’s pretty much a requirement that Mr. Bezos figure out how he was compromised.As Mr. Bezos’ investigation continued, The Post and others floated theories that American Media had gone after Mr. Bezos for political reasons, perhaps because President Trump considers him an enemy for the work his newspaper does. On Medium, Mr. Bezos included emails from an American Media lawyer demanding that he issue a statement saying he had no “basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated” — or face the photos going public. If the emails are authentic, that looks pretty suspect.Rather than struggling with his media foes in the quiet back room of a law firm, Mr. Bezos decided to do it the internet way — much as American Media’s BFF, President Trump, does — and just say it all out loud on Medium and Twitter. Bypassing the traditional media, he wrote a highly personal post alleging a shakedown.Good for him. While it’s fair game to criticize his business, if done with fairness and accuracy, American Media went too far. By pushing back, Mr. Bezos has taken a deeply embarrassing situation and turned it to his own advantage. While jokes abound, he’s having a bit of a heroic moment here, as the guy who will not take it anymore. There is only glory in rolling over the log, as Mr. Bezos wrote, to see how these vermin use embarrassing photos and gossip, amplified by social media, as weapons. He was willing to expose himself — pun intended — in the process.In an era when the forces of sneakiness and sleaze on the internet seem to be ascendant, from the Russian incursion onto Facebook to the ways social media is used to spew hatred, it is a rare thing to see someone turn the tables.That said, I’m not entirely sanguine about the ability of powerful people like Mr. Bezos to use digital tools for their own private aims. We have seen leaders, like Mr. Trump, harness Twitter to spread lies and create new realities, and to harass journalists, as Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, and many other strongmen have done.Mr. Bezos, too, has the ability to use his huge digital reach in all kinds of ways, and he may someday be tempted to do so in situations where the villains are not as obvious as Mr. Pecker and his band of media thugs. I doubt he would, but he certainly could.For now though, Mr. Bezos is striking a blow for everyone. Regular people suffer data hacks and privacy violations daily, largely from having their information mined and manipulated in order to build enormous advertising businesses, as Facebook and Google do, or to sell us more stuff (hello, Amazon!).Mr. Bezos clearly is winning here. He should use the opportunity to reflect on how he can lead the fight to protect everyone’s privacy and digital dignity, even as he takes back his own.RelatedOpinion | Maureen Dowd: Daddy Warbucks Goes to WarFeb. 9, 2019Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of ‘Extortion and Blackmail’Feb. 7, 2019Complexifier, Mr. Bezos?

5c9aaede49f0eacbf105f314,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/media/apple-tv-plus-hollywood.html,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — A delegation from Los Angeles trekked 300 miles to Apple’s campus armed with questions.Questions like: How much will viewers be charged for the coming slate of Apple programming? When will the shows be released? How will they be marketed?There were plenty of famous people onstage during the nearly two-hour presentation streamed live on Monday from the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., and plenty of skillful corporate stagecraft — but when it was all over, Hollywood’s main questions had gone unanswered.While entertainment veterans are rooting for the company to succeed in its new venture, they still need a little more convincing before they will endorse the notion that Apple has created “a new service dedicated to the best stories ever told,” as one of its executives, Jamie Erlicht, put it on Monday.In the first hour of the show, Apple played up its new brand identity as something other than a company that turned out hardware products by unveiling its news and gaming services. It also announced deals it had struck for programming from HBO, CBS, Showtime and Starz, as well as a credit card it had created with Goldman Sachs.The next act was the charm-and-dazzle portion of the program — Steven Spielberg! Oprah Winfrey! Big Bird! — during which Apple tried to get the word out to its customer base that it had become a major content company to rival Netflix or HBO.A secondary audience for the star-studded display was the entertainment industry itself, a group that included the producers, actors, executives and agents in the room, as well as their confreres monitoring the event from Los Angeles.Apple, which will house its original programming and shows from other companies in an app called Apple TV Plus, spent more than $1 billion on entertainment in the last year and a half. That expenditure brought a number of stars to the alien turf of Silicon Valley.The night before the 10 a.m. presentation, there was a cocktail party — no press invited — for many of the entertainment people now in business with the no-longer-just-a-tech company. The famous among them gathered for a Vanity Fair-style photo session. Art Streiber, a frequent celebrity portraitist for the magazine, shot group pictures in color and black and white. Ms. Winfrey was seated front and center, flanked by Jennifer Aniston and the Apple chief executive Tim Cook.The majority of the portrait subjects had outfitted themselves in the minimalist style long associated with the brand. The renegades included the “Aquaman” star Jason Momoa, who wore a wide-brimmed hat, and Jada Pinkett Smith, whose yellow skirt popped.Not long before the Monday showcase, the weekend arrivals were joined by the rest of the Hollywood contingent, who had jetted that morning to Cupertino, a city not known for its five-star accommodations. In flats, heels and black leather sneakers, they tramped up a hill on a cloudy, blustery morning. Youthful, cheerful Apple employees shouted out “Hello!” and “Good morning!”Image“This is my first time at Apple,” Steven Spielberg said on Monday. He is rebooting his 1980s-era NBC series “Amazing Stories” for Apple TV Plus.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesThe agents, producers and executives stepped into the rounded glass space above the theater. It looked like an Apple Store, only grander, with no products on display, but plenty of coffee. “It’s time to begin the descent,” an Apple employee said, gesturing toward a stairwell as showtime approached.The Los Angeles crowd sat among Apple employees and others in the dark. They took in the information about Apple News Plus and the credit card. Then came the part of the show they had come to see.Mr. Spielberg, who is rebooting his 1980s-era NBC series “Amazing Stories” for Apple, had not appeared in the group portraits taken the night before, but he was the first member of the Hollywood envoy to take the stage.“This is my first time at Apple,” he said.He was followed by J. J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon, Ms. Aniston, Ms. Winfrey, and let’s not forget Big Bird, who was there to promote Apple’s plan to make children’s shows with Sesame Workshop, the maker of “Sesame Street.”While the presentation was something new for Apple, it was familiar to the audience members from Los Angeles. That’s because what they were seeing was essentially an upfront presentation.The so-called upfronts are a decades-old convention in the television business. Networks stage them for advertisers in Manhattan at Carnegie Hall, the Beacon Theater, and Radio City Music Hall. Stars take the spotlight to engage in scripted banter. Executives give rah-rah speeches. Skillfully edited clips raise hopes that the new shows will not be stinkers. Musicians and stand-up comics offer breaks in the action. Fall lineups are introduced with much fanfare.Despite the disruptive effect Apple promises to have on the entertainment industry, the company followed an old script on Monday. Mr. Spielberg talked up “Amazing Stories.” Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston promoted their drama, “The Morning Show,” and did some patter with their co-star, Steve Carell. The writer, actor, producer and comedian Kumail Nanjiani played up his anthology show about immigrants, “Little America.” The singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, introduced by Mr. Abrams, sat at a keyboard and sang the title theme to their musical series, “Little Voice.”When Apple’s heads of entertainment, the former Sony studio heads Mr. Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, hit the stage, there was thunderous applause as Hollywood cheered its own. A glimpse of their labors appeared in a one-minute, 43-second sizzle reel with clips from the coming programs. Apple hewed to the old timeline favored by traditional broadcast networks in announcing that the shows were “coming this fall.”A partial standing ovation greeted the celebrity saved for last: Ms. Winfrey. “There has never been a moment quite like this one,” she said, echoing the hyperbole that had been prevalent. She spoke of two documentaries, one on workplace sexual harassment, the other on mental health, and laid out plans for what sounded like an Apple-enhanced revival of the Oprah Book Club.Mr. Cook was the show’s closer. He paced before a black-and-white group portrait shot by Mr. Streiber the night before. It was projected behind him, the size of a mural. “They’ve impacted our culture, our society,” Mr. Cook said of its subjects, whom he praised as “these amazingly passionate and award-winning artists.”The lights went up and the members of the Hollywood group went out. Celebrities and sizzle reels were nothing new to them, so they were buzzing more about the new credit card than anything else. Made of titanium, with rounded edges and no pesky numbers to mar its face, it is likely to be a Beverly Hills status object. They also went on about the card because the event had not laid to rest their concerns about marketing, premiere dates and the cost of the streaming service to consumers.It was also not lost on them that, despite the impressive celebrity cavalcade, many of the stars on display were not exclusive to Apple. Mr. Spielberg has his own production company and makes deals freely. Ms. Witherspoon has shows with HBO and Hulu. Even Big Bird has ties to PBS and HBO.While skeptical, however, Hollywood is rooting for Apple. In addition to assuming the role of Medici-like patron, it is a viable competitor to Netflix, which can only be good for business. As Ms. Winfrey had put it, speaking of the worldwide reach of Apple’s devices, “They’re in a billion pockets, y’all. A billion pockets.”"
5c9a232c49f0eacbf105f183,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/apple-streaming-hollywood-news-plus.html,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Yesterday, Cupertino got the kind of fevered coverage usually reserved for the unveiling of Apple’s latest gadget. But this time, the product wasn’t a watch or a phone.During the two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus, the company’s leaders detailed its plans to take on Hollywood by creating its own TV shows and documentaries. They also announced a news subscription service and a credit card.Yes, big-name celebrities like Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon were on hand for the spectacle. But tech watchers were also paying close attention because the announcements are part of a major shift for the Silicon Valley mammoth.Here’s what you need to know:Why is this such a big deal?Apple has spent a decade establishing its dominant place in consumers’ pockets by getting them hooked on iPhones. But after years of record-breaking profits, phone sales are slowing and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Amazon and Netflix.So, instead of betting on another gadget, Apple made clear yesterday that it’s “trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years,” as my colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and John Koblin reported.That means Apple is bulking up on content and services, and focusing less on hardware.Not that there isn’t a lot of Apple hardware already out there: The company counts roughly 1.4 billion active devices as the perfect vehicles for its new content.What’s this about more subscription services? First, there was Apple TV Plus, the video streaming service, which will have original programs and will include shows from networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS. Beyond that, details were sparse. No price was given.But, as my colleague Edmund Lee explained, one thing’s for sure: You won’t be able to get your favorite Netflix shows.There was more on Apple News Plus, which was described as the “Netflix of news,” but it also raised questions about Apple’s place in an information ecosystem that’s been brutal to existing publishers.A subscription will cost $9.99 per month. It will let subscribers read 300 magazines as well as articles from newspapers including The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.Executives with The Journal said they’ll hire new staff members to write content that’s exclusive to the Apple app, which Bloomberg described as a risky move that could “cannibalize existing readership.”Neither The Times nor The Washington Post has signed on.Apple also announced a video game subscription service, Apple Arcade, which is set to start this fall.Here’s what else we’re following(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

5c99122349f0eacbf105eee8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/technology/apple-news-streaming-service.html,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple unveiled a new video streaming service on Monday with a parade of celebrities rarely seen on a stage outside of Hollywood’s awards season, with heavyweight directors like Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams and stars like Octavia Spencer and Jennifer Aniston.Oprah Winfrey even served as the closer for the nearly two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus. “They’re in a billion pockets, y’all,” Ms. Winfrey said of Apple’s global reach. “A billion pockets.”As enthusiastic as the entertainment industry appears to be to work with Apple, it is increasingly clear that Apple needs Hollywood. After years of record profits, the company is slowing down. Phone sales are cooling, and despite the relative popularity of products like the Apple Watch, the next big thing has eluded the Silicon Valley giant.Now, short of another game-changing gadget and facing tough competition from rivals like Amazon and Netflix, Apple is trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years. The company unveiled an expansive strategy to push consumers to do more than just buy its hardware products. It has plans for new monthly subscription services for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card.The new services represent an evolution of Apple’s business. For years, Apple focused mainly on selling devices, counting on consumers to upgrade phones and tablets every few years. Now the company is keying on selling content and services for its roughly 1.4 billion active devices, which include Apple TV boxes, Apple Watches, Mac computers and iPads.The streaming service is called Apple TV Plus. After years of speculation about what an Apple alternative to Netflix might look like, the company offered few details about the new offering — but plenty of razzle dazzle. Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Kumail Nanjiani, Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard — even Big Bird from Sesame Street — also joined Apple executives on the stage.At the heart of Apple TV Plus will be new original programs. It will not carry advertising and will begin this fall in more than 100 countries. It will also include programs from other television networks like HBO, Showtime, Starz and CBS.ImageFrom left, Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston announce Apple’s new streaming services.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesBut some of the biggest questions going into the Apple event were not answered, starting with price. The stars talked about their new programs, but the broad story lines of the shows were already known.Mr. Spielberg was the first Hollywood celebrity to take the stage, and he received the morning’s first standing ovation. “This is my first time at Apple,” he said.Mr. Spielberg was also speaking for many in the entertainment industry who were making their first trip to Apple’s campus 300 miles north from Los Angeles. Since October 2017, Apple has spent well over $1 billion on original programming. Five shows have completed filming, and another half-dozen will be finished in the coming months. Apple has ordered about two dozen series altogether.But Apple is coming late to the game. Netflix has been making original programming for seven years and will spend at least $10 billion on content this year. Amazon and Hulu have also made tremendous inroads with the industry.Apple’s entertainment foray could also lead to a culture clash. Silicon Valley and Hollywood operate in distinctly different ways: Apple prides itself on secrecy, while Hollywood runs on a wealth of information. Perhaps aware of this sensitivity, Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, began describing his company last week as an entertainment company instead of a tech company.Apple’s streaming music service has 56 million subscribers. It offers additional cloud storage for a monthly fee, and it takes a cut of the money spent on apps running on its devices, as well as a sliver of digital payments made by iPhones. Apple generated $10.9 billion from services in the last quarter of 2018, compared to $73.4 billion from hardware sales.The video service is the linchpin of Apple’s broader services push. In addition to customers paying $1,000 every two or three years for a new iPhone, Apple hopes they will also pay $10, $20, $30 or $40 a month a one-stop shop for content for all their devices.“In essence Apple is seeking to become a Netflix of everything in services; music, news and magazines, video and games,” said Paolo Pescatore, a technology, media and telecoms analyst at PP Foresight.ImageRoger Rosner, Apple’s vice president of apps, at Monday’s event.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesApple said its Apple News Plus subscription will include access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker, National Geographic and InStyle. It will also feature newspapers like The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. The subscription will cost $9.99 a month and is available beginning today in the United States and Canada.The subscription service builds on a free news app that the company released in late 2015 and comes installed on the company’s iOS software. Apple said about five billion articles are read monthly on Apple News.The price to be part of Apple’s paid news offering is steep. Apple is taking a 50 percent cut of the subscriptions, with the publications splitting what’s left over based on readership. Apple’s cut for news is larger than the 30 percent it takes for subscriptions bought in the App Store. Publishers expressed concern that Apple would maintain access to important consumer data such as credit cards and email addresses as part of the deal.The Wall Street Journal said its business stories and analysis would remain exclusive to its paying subscribers, but it sees an opportunity to reach a new category of readers for general interest news. The newspaper said it would add to its newsroom to support Apple News Plus. The New York Times and The Washington Post decided to not join the service.For video games, the company said it would start a subscription service called Apple Arcade this fall. It did not offer any pricing details for the service, but the company said this will allow people to try out new games. Apple said it will help foot some of the development costs for game developers.Apple also unveiled a credit card called Apple Card. Working in tandem with Goldman Sachs, the company said the new credit card is meant to work mainly on the iPhone — users can apply for the card on the phone and be instantly approved. It will reap bigger rewards if the consumer uses the card on Apple Pay, the company’s digital payment system.The credit card offers 2 percent cash back for spending on Apple Pay. Apple touted how it simplified credit card rewards with “daily cash” deposited back into the digital wallet on the iPhone shortly after purchasing an item.After its barrage of announcements, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, introduced Ms. Winfrey. Apple signed to a deal with her in June 2018. Ms. Winfrey said she was making two documentaries for Apple’s new video service and bringing her book club to the company and turn it into the “biggest, most vibrant, most stimulating” book club on the planet."
5c89929e49f0eacbf105ceee,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/college-scandal-mcglashan-caplan.html,"William E. McGlashan Jr. was sitting on Richard Branson’s private island several years ago when the idea first struck him: He would create a new venture capital fund focused on ethical investing.He had been inspired during a conference on the island also attended by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs, and Jeff Skoll, the first president of eBay. Soon after, he would recruit them and the U2 singer Bono to the Rise Fund on the promise of doing good.Yet on Tuesday, Mr. McGlashan was one of 50 people caught up in a federal investigation into college admissions fraud, a scandal that has ensnared prominent parents who stand accused of paying bribes to give their children an edge.While two Hollywood actresses were the most recognizable figures to face charges, they were outnumbered by business titans who are not household names.Mr. McGlashan is widely seen as one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful investors, a partner at the $103 billion investment firm TPG. The fund he oversaw there invested in prominent brands including Airbnb, Spotify and Uber. He has been placed on leave from TPG and Rise.Also charged were Gordon Caplan, a top mergers and acquisitions attorney who was a co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr, and Doug Hodge, the retired chief executive of Pimco, one of the world’s biggest bond fund managers. Mr. Caplan was placed on leave on Wednesday, and Mr. Hodge’s name was stripped from the website of Sway Ventures, an investment firm where he was a venture partner.Mr. Hodge is also listed as a board member for two wealthy private schools in California: Sage Hill School and the Thacher School. Blossom Beatty Pidduck, Thacher’s head of school, said on Wednesday that Mr. Hodge had been on the board since 2011 and that the board was discussing whether to let him continue serving. Messages left with Sage Hill were not returned Wednesday.The actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were the boldface names in the charges announced on Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Boston, but such celebrities may still be able to find work after their cases are resolved. That won’t necessarily be the case for the high-powered lawyers and money managers on the list.“Professionals, their stock in trade has to be their integrity,” said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “Celebrities have a different stock in trade.”Mr. Caplan, who worked on complex deals for Hudson’s Bay including the sale of Lord & Taylor’s former flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, would lose his law license in New York if convicted of a felony. Mr. McGlashan, whose reputation drew star power to a fund with the idea of positive social change, may have a hard time raising money if he has a felony conviction on his record. And Mr. Hodge, who told Harvard Business Review last year that he was surprised “how quickly opportunity came my way” after his retirement, could see those chances to do something new dry up.ImageMr. McGlashan and the U2 singer Bono, another founder of the Rise Fund, listening to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund at this year’s World Economic Forum.CreditArnd Wiegmann/ReutersAfter the charges were announced, the firms quickly sought to distance themselves from the accused. TPG’s announcement noted that the charges against Mr. McGlashan were for “personal misconduct,” and Willkie Farr pointed out that the case against Mr. Caplan was “a personal matter and does not involve Willkie or any of its clients.” Willkie also removed Mr. Caplan’s biography from the firm’s website.A lawyer for Mr. Caplan and a spokesman for Mr. McGlashan declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Hodge could not be reached for comment.Neither TPG nor Willkie is likely to be undone by the charges against a leadership figure, but both firms may face uncomfortable questions from clients and investors. TPG, for example, has long cultivated an image as a progressive and trustworthy institution. It moved quickly to install Jim Coulter, its chief executive and a co-founder, as acting chief of the Rise Fund.Mr. McGlashan is listed as one of several “key men” in agreements with investors who committed money to TPG, but his suspension — or potential permanent exit — would not unwind those agreements unless several more of TPG’s top managers departed, according to a person familiar with the firm’s operations, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Investors in the fund have committed money for several years, and the case is unlikely to have a direct financial impact on the fund.On Wednesday, Mr. McGlashan stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment, the film studio that he helped found with the producer Robert Simonds. The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times. STX is funded in large part by TPG, which said in the memo that it remained committed to the studio, whose movies include the teen comedy “The Edge of Seventeen.”Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics, said she expected few clients would leave Willkie Farr because of the charges against Mr. Caplan, who in April was named a “deal maker of the year” by The American Lawyer, a trade magazine. But she said the case could give potential clients a reason to ask questions about the firm’s culture and its process for selecting lawyers to manage the firm.“They made the choice to have this person represent the firm,” Ms. Roiphe said.Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors describe how parents were willing to pay William Singer, the founder of the Edge College & Career Network, a college preparatory business, up to $75,000 to arrange for cheating on standardized tests or hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe college coaches to recruit a student. Mr. Singer, who has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice, cooperated with the investigation.According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer advised Mr. McGlashan to claim that his son had learning disabilities, which would allow the student more time to complete an entrance exam, and Mr. McGlashan gave $50,000 to Mr. Singer’s charity. The men also discussed creating a fake football recruiting profile for his son.Mr. Hodge paid more than half a million dollars to get two of his children into the University of Southern California, according to prosecutors, who also said his discussions with Mr. Singer had been captured on secret recordings.Mr. Caplan was also caught on tape, the authorities said. In discussing the scheme to improve his daughter’s college entrance exam score in return for $75,000, prosecutors said, Mr. Caplan asked Mr. Singer a number of times if anyone has gotten “caught” or “ever gotten into an issue with this.”At one point, prosecutors said, he told Mr. Singer: “Keep in mind I am a lawyer. So I am sort of rule-oriented.”"
5c7ada1849f0eacbf105b0aa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/opinion/sunday/trump-cohen-theranos-fraud.html,"Maybe the best book I read last year was “Bad Blood,” about the epic sham of the biotech start-up Theranos and its delusional creator, Elizabeth Holmes. I had trouble shaking it, and it roared back into my mind on Wednesday, when Michael Cohen testified publicly before the House Oversight Committee and retraced the mountain of lies buttressing Donald Trump’s business empire and the clouds of fiction preventing any clear view of it. This country of ours doesn’t lack for frauds, I thought. We were probably bound to elevate one to the highest office in the land.In November 2016 we did. As anyone paying close attention then knew and anyone who finally woke up over these last few ugly days must now admit, we gave the supreme prize and ultimate compliment — leadership of the most powerful nation on earth — to a man who wouldn’t know the truth if it raced toward him with sirens blaring, ran over him, then backed up and did it again; whose loyalties stand as firm as a strand of overcooked linguine; whose vanity makes Narcissus look like a mere pretender; and who will sacrifice whatever and whomever he must on the altar of his own spurious magnificence. What he lacks in moral fiber he makes up for in gilt. It sufficed to bring him his treasure and, for 72 years and counting, spare him his reckoning.There are several kinds of success stories. We emphasize the ones starring brilliant inventors and earnest toilers. We celebrate sweat and stamina. We downplay the schemers, the short cuts and the subterfuge. But for every ambitious person who has the goods and is prepared to pay his or her dues, there’s another who doesn’t and is content to play the con. In the Trump era and the Trump orbit, these ambassadors of a darker side of the American dream have come to the fore. What a con Holmes played with Theranos. For those unfamiliar with the tale, which the journalist John Carreyrou told brilliantly in “Bad Blood,” she dropped out of Stanford at 19 to pursue her Silicon Valley dream, intent on becoming a billionaire and on claiming the same perch in our culture and popular imagination that Steve Jobs did. She modeled her work habits and management style after his. She dressed as he did, in black turtlenecks. She honed a phony voice, deeper than her real one.[Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni’s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]And for a good long while it worked, which was more than could be said of the product that Theranos peddled, a magical black box that was supposed to be able, with just a few drops of blood from the prick of a finger, to screen for scores of ailments and diseases. She spoke, with immaculate assurance, of a day when it might be on everyone’s bathroom counter: a time saver, a money saver and quite possibly a lifesaver. She sent early, imperfect versions of it to Walgreens pharmacies, which used it and thus doled out erroneous diagnoses to patients. She blocked peer reviews of it and buried evidence of its failures.This went on not for months but for years, as Holmes attracted more than $900 million of investment money and lured a breathtakingly distinguished board of directors including two former secretaries of state, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger; a former secretary of defense, William Perry; and a future secretary of defense, James Mattis. What they had before them wasn’t proof or even the sturdy promise of revolutionary technology. It was a self-appointed wunderkind who struck a persuasive pose and talked an amazing game. She was eventually found out, and faces criminal charges that could put her in prison. But there’s no guarantee of that. Meantime she lives in luxury. God bless America.Theranos was perhaps an outlier in the scope of its deceptions, but not in the deceptions themselves. In an article titled “The Ugly Unethical Underside of Silicon Valley” in Fortune magazine in December 2016, Erin Griffith tallied a list of aborted ventures with more shimmer and swagger than substance, asserting: “As the list of start-up scandals grows, it’s time to ask whether entrepreneurs are taking ‘fake it till you make it’ too far.” Interesting word there: fake. A president who’s a textbook study in the psychological phenomenon of projection — by which you attribute to others the flaws that you possess — uses it all the time. What did he call Cohen’s interchanges with House lawmakers on Wednesday? “A fake hearing,” of course.Dangle the prospects of celebrity and riches, and plenty of charlatans rush forward. So it stands to reason that a country of supersize celebrity and riches would have a surfeit of charlatans, including some who see even the White House as fair game. Cohen’s testimony confirmed yet again how much pure bluster fueled Trump’s quest, and how heavily Trump’s entire career leaned on shady arithmetic, personal myth making and intimidation: all arrows abundant in the quivers of Holmes and her Silicon Valley kin. But that testimony was also a reminder of how gullible their audiences are, how readily we all believe when we perceive some benefit in the transaction. This isn’t just the land of the fraud but the home of the knave, and Cohen implored Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters nationwide to learn from his own credulity. It takes two to bamboozle: the illusionist and the enraptured.I sometimes think that when Trump came down that escalator at Trump Tower, he didn’t just begin a presidential campaign. He pinched the edge of a scab on our body politic and began to tug, revealing all the racism, resentments and partisan fury beneath it. He gave us a fresh, jolting glimpse of just how much depravity and even criminality exist among the powerful (and the power-mad). Look at his own collaborators: Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, David Pecker and lesser reprobates who either still serve in his administration (Alex Acosta, Jared Kushner) or did until they went too far (Tom Price, Scott Pruitt).They’re favor traders, corner cutters, rule breakers, perk hoarders. They’re notorious examples of types that many of us see all the time. How many people owe their success to exaggerating their talents, grabbing credit when it doesn’t belong to them and projecting a potency that’s really smoke and mirrors? How many depend on the continued support of people who bought the performance in the beginning and don’t want to admit that they were duped? Trump and Holmes are such achievers in extremis.They also have a competitive advantage: They’re without shame. There’s a whole lot you can do once you’ve slipped that tether. To the unscrupulous go the spoils.Trump’s amorality play contradicts our paeans to the Puritan work ethic. It’s not the script that we teach our children. But with Trump in the White House, validated by tens of millions of votes, it may well be what some of them are learning.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

5c7f0e7149f0eacbf105b84a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/opinion/luke-perry-90210-stroke.html,"It was my brother who saved my life.“Get to a hospital now,” he insisted over the long-distance line. “You’re having a stroke.”I had just flown to Hong Kong to run an important conference and I was tempted to dismiss this big-brother, over-the-phone diagnosis (even though my brother, Jeff, is, in fact, a doctor).I was only 49 years old, I was healthy and had none of the conditions like high blood pressure that might predict a stroke.I imagine this is what the actor Luke Perry thought when the paramedics first reached him. A stroke? No way. Only old people get those. Mr. Perry, famous for his role in “Beverly Hills, 90210,” was just 52 when he died in the aftermath of that stroke on Monday.I’d assumed that what was happening to me was just another of my many migraines, made only slightly weirder by a slight tingle on the side of my mouth and hand, as well as very temporary dysphasia, which made my words garbled.That morning I’d been working on a story about yet another management crisis at Yahoo. “What a goat rodeo,” I had said out loud, which came out “Grrxxxx gghrtt jjjtrws.” Then, when I went to eat a strawberry, it slowly dropped from the side of my useless mouth, leaving a stain first on my shirt and then on the carpet of the luxury hotel room I had just checked into.I stared at the stain — which was a bright and beautiful red — and instead of being concerned about my numb lip, I ran to get a towel to clean up the mess. Then, as I had often done when I had a sore throat or some other minor ailment, I texted Jeff the symptoms.By the time I’d showered and headed to the restaurant for breakfast, the symptoms were largely gone. So when Jeff called to say I was having a stroke, I think I laughed and said, “You’re a bad doctor.”[Read the most thought-provoking stories from The New York Times Opinion section. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter]Besides, I had Yahoo’s Jerry Yang coming to the conference, I had Alibaba’s Jack Ma coming, I had Al Gore coming. I had no time.That much was very true. Because he was actually a very good doctor, he insisted in an increasingly urgent tone that I go to the hospital right then. That’s because when it comes to strokes, time is critical. You have to get the blood flowing back to the part of the brain that is not getting it.So I listened, for once, sidelining the obstreperous little sister, and took a car to get an emergency M.R.I.There it was on the screen: evidence of a transient ischemic attack, often called a mini-stroke. Like the strawberry stain, it was also riveting to look at with its garish neon glow, from the angry yellow clot to the stream of red blood worming its way around it to the multicolored brain of mine full of so many ideas but also just a hunk of misfiring flesh.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]As it turned out, there was a lot of that, including a small hole in my heart through which the clot traveled, as well as me having a type of blood that is more prone to clotting. All of it, combined with not hydrating or walking around enough on the long flight to Hong Kong, created what the doctor, who immediately started the treatment of anticoagulant drugs and others, called a “hole in one.”That was a good joke at a bad time. It’s funny the things you remember at the critical times of your life. Like the extraordinarily bright whiteness of the surgical mask of that doctor, who also told me that had I not moved faster it would have been so much worse.“You might have lost your abilities,” he said from somewhere from behind the mask. “You might have died.”It was only then that I cried, and only because of my sons, then 6 and 9. My own father had died suddenly when I was 5. He, too, had a brain issue, but it was a more lethal one — an aneurysm that burst without warning on a sunny winter morning over 50 years ago. While he lingered for a short time, he was no longer himself. That was that and that was the rest of our lives.And that is why the idea of death — the absolute nearness of it — has been ever-present for me. Since my dad died, I have lived my life as if I had no time at all or very little, making the kinds of choices of someone who knew that tomorrow might indeed be her last.That was the thrust of a major speech at Stanford University in 2005 by the Apple founder and tech visionary Steve Jobs:For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.It was an unusually emotional speech from someone who was widely thought to have no heart. But, actually, I have always thought that the problem with Mr. Jobs was that he had too much heart, because he seemed to always grok that the end was always nigh. Sometimes that urgency manifested itself in inspiration, sometimes in meanness, sometimes in humor, sometimes in seriousness. But it was always urgent.RelatedMore on Luke Perry. Luke Perry, ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’ Star, Is Dead at 52March 4, 2019Here’s How Strokes Happen When You’re as Young as Luke PerryMarch 5, 2019Opinion | Maris KreizmanLuke Perry Was the First Bad Boy I LovedMarch 5, 2019When he died on Oct. 5, 2011, I read and reread that speech to keep it in my own heart, too. That was a good thing, because my own stroke came only a few days later. I had both the privilege to live more days and the awareness that those days would be limited.If you want to analyze my motivations for being known as pretty tough on the people I cover when they inevitably mess up, it has its roots there. Basically, you all don’t have the time to be so careless in what you do and I don’t have the time to not ask you about it.You get this kind of nudge again and again from death. It is, as the Buddhist teacher Frank Ostaseski noted, “a secret teacher hiding in plain sight.”Luke Perry’s death was yet another lesson from that teacher. Like many, I was a major fan of “90210” in its glory days and gave over so much of my precious time — every second worth it — to watching and then discussing the foibles of the kids of West Beverly Hills High. That definitely included the fantastic brooding of Mr. Perry’s Dylan McKay, who was given to saying things like, “The only person you can trust in this world is yourself.”Well, I guess, but not if you are lucky enough to have a brother who saved your life.

5cae3b3c49f0eacbf1f826c3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/movies/black-hole-movies-streaming.html,"Wednesday’s unveiling of the first image of a black hole — found in the Messier 87 galaxy, roughly 55 million light-years away — has captured the imagination of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world. But of all the intriguing and humbling phenomena to be found in outer space, why are black holes such a particular fascination?Maybe it has something to do with science-fiction, which has long exploited the narrative possibilities offered by these inescapable regions of space (as in the movie “High Life,” which debuts this week). What follows is a look at some of the best streamable movies in the black hole canon: We can’t guarantee all the science, but we can tell you where to find them.[Read about the first ever image of a black hole.]‘The Black Hole’ (1979)How to watch: Rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.Walt Disney Productions had a humble goal for this (then) big-budget production: Two years after “Star Wars,” the company wanted a blockbuster space opera of its own. According to the book “The Mouse Machine,” by J. P. Telotte, the studio took notice of the increasing chatter in scientific circles about black holes (Archibald Wheeler had coined the term in 1967), revising the original script and focusing on the crew of a deep space mission and its discovery of not only a black hole but also another ship that somehow managed to elude the gravitational pull. Reviews were mixed, and the film recouped only its costs. But it did introduce an important new element to Disney filmmaking: computer-generated animation.‘A Brief History of Time’ (1992)How to watch: Stream it on The Criterion Channel; rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Perhaps no single scientist shaped more of our contemporary thought and fascination with black holes than the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, whose ideas about black holes, quantum mechanics, radiation and relativity were neatly packaged in his 1988 best-seller “A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes.” Four years later, the director Errol Morris (“The Thin Blue Line”) released his documentary film adaptation of the book, featuring extensive interviews with Hawking and his colleagues, friends and family, intermingling his biography with vivid and ingenious visualizations of his thoughts and theories. Hawking’s work is dense and complex, but Morris’s dazzling film furthers the source book’s mission of making the science of space a bit more understandable to the layperson.‘Event Horizon’ (1997)How to watch: Stream it on Showtime; rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.The new image from Messier 87 was possible, in a large part, because of a network of radio antennas known as the Event Horizon Telescope. That name has a logical tie to its target: The event horizon is “the edge of a black hole, the point of no return,” according to the Times reporter Dennis Overbye, who notes, “beyond the event horizon, not even light can escape the black hole’s gravitational pull.” But it will summon a different connotation to movie fans. Paul W.S. Anderson’s “Event Horizon” makes black holes into horror fodder, telling the story of a vessel that creates an artificial black hole in order to make a space travel wormhole. Suffice to say, things go very wrong.‘Star Trek’ (2009)How to watch: Stream it on Amazon; rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Science-fiction television shows, like the later iterations of “Star Trek” and “Battlestar Galactica,” have made black holes a mainstay of their storytelling. But the “Star Trek” film series hasn’t had much use for them, with the notable exception of J.J. Abrams’s 2009 reboot of the franchise. Nero (Eric Bana), the Romulan villain of the film, uses the principles of the black hole for dastardly ends, creating an artificial black hole out of “red matter” to destroy the planet Vulcan. But then a real black hole creates a time warp that sends Mr. Spock back in time to help Captain Kirk and his own younger self try to stop Nero. (It all makes sense in the movie.)‘Interstellar’ (2014)How to watch: Rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.This Kubrick-inspired sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan hangs a key plot point on black holes: The deep-space crew at its center, led by the former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), is sent to explore a wormhole leading to potentially habitable planets. But the wormhole’s proximity to a black hole causes gravitational time dilation; in the brief time Cooper and another crew member (Anne Hathaway) spend exploring one of the planets, 23 years of earth time elapse, causing duress for the scientists. Nolan, known for his meticulousness, took great pains to try to ensure that the science of the film checked out, and its rendering of the black hole was considered by many to be the most realistic yet in a fiction film.‘The Theory of Everything’ (2014)How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; rent or buy it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.“Mr. Morris conveys something of what Dr. Hawking thinks about black hole evaporation, imaginary time and curved space,” The Times’s Timothy Ferris wrote about Morris’s “A Brief History of Time.” “But for most viewers, these exotic ideas will be overshadowed by the human drama of the great physicist’s triumph over adversity.” The director James Marsh focused firmly on that drama in this biopic, with an Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne as a young Hawking and an Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones as his future wife, Jane. As they struggle to come to terms with a motor neuron disorder that confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, he develops his initial theories about the visibility of black holes — though there is not much time to get into scientific specifics."
5c4733893a125f5075c05ac8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/stream-oscar-nominated-movies.html,"This morning, Kumail Nanjiani and Tracee Ellis Ross announced the nominees for the 91st Academy Awards, many of which are already streaming online. Need to get caught up? Some of the biggest contenders are still in theaters, but many are already streaming. Here’s a rundown of where to find those nominees that are streaming in the biggest categories, with links to our original reviews.BEST PICTURE NOMINEESImageAdam Driver, left, and John David Washington in “BlacKkKlansman.”CreditDavid Lee/Focus Features‘BlacKkKlansman’Nominated for: best picture, supporting actor, director, adapted screenplay, editing, original scoreHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.In telling the fact-based story of a black Colorado Springs cop named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) who infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan chapter in the early 1970s, the director Spike Lee takes a tonally audacious approach — part stranger-than-fiction irreverence, part political statement about the legacy of white supremacy. The balance pays off in surprisingly accessible entertainment that bridges the horrors of past and present.Read the New York Times review[Who’s in? Who’s out?

Michael B. Jordan makes a particularly vivid contribution as Killmonger, a villain whose threat to T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the newly crowned king of the techno-utopian nation of Wakanda, is rooted in competing notions of black identity.Read the New York Times reviewImageFrom left, Gwilym Lee, Rami Malek and Joe Mazzello in a scene from “Bohemian Rhapsody.”CreditAlex Bailey/20th Century Fox‘Bohemian Rhapsody’Nominated for: best picture, actor, editing, sound editing, sound mixingHow to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu and Google Play.As music history, “Bohemian Rhapsody” takes a “print the legend” approach to Queen and its electrifying frontman, Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek). The film plays fast-and-loose with the facts, adhering to the formula of traditional biopics like “Walk the Line” and “Ray,” but it was a box-office sensation for a reason, tapping into the creative breakthroughs that led to hits like the title track and into the passion that infused the band’s career-capping Live Aid performance.Read the New York Times reviewImageYalitza Aparicio and Marco Graf in “Roma,” the first Netflix title to earn a best picture Oscar nomination.CreditCarlos Somonte/Netflix‘Roma’Nominated for: best picture, director, actress, supporting actress, original screenplay, foreign language film, cinematography, production design, sound editing, sound mixingHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.Returning to the Mexico City of his youth, the director Alfonso Cuarón vividly imagines his upper-middle-class upbringing through the experiences of a live-in housekeeper (Yalitza Aparicio) whose hardships may not have been clear to him at the time. In the neighborhood of Colonia Roma in 1970, the maid tends to the needs of a bustling family during a turbulent period — for them, for her and for a country roiled by political unrest.Read the New York Times review[What were the snubs?

5c73d91b3a125f5075c0b648,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/movies/oscars-stream-movies.html,"On an Oscar night when all eight best picture nominees took home one or more awards, “Green Book” emerged as the big winner, taking the top prize along with wins for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali’s supporting performance as Dr. Don Shirley, an African-American concert pianist touring the South during segregation. A few of the winning features have yet to debut on streaming services — “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” is coming Tuesday, and “If Beale Street Could Talk” and “Vice” follow in successive weeks. But all the others are widely available to watch now.[Read all about the ceremony and the night’s big winners.]‘Green Book’Won for: Best picture, original screenplay, supporting actorHow to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.Despite persistent criticism over its “white savior” narrative and storytelling liberties, this warm comedy-drama has appealed to many with its optimistic vision of racial harmony against a hostile backdrop. Ali and Viggo Mortensen have a likable odd couple chemistry as a celebrated African-American pianist and an Italian-American bouncer who escorts him on a concert tour through the segregated Deep South in 1962. One of the writers, Peter Farrelly, has a background in broad comedies like “Kingpin” and “There’s Something about Mary,” which informs the unlikely camaraderie between the two men and buoys the film in its darker stretches.[Read the New York Times review.]‘Roma’Won for: director, cinematography, foreign language filmHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.At once a personal reflection on his childhood and an expansive look at the cultural turbulence of early 1970s Mexico City, Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” is an empathetic attempt to look at the past from a fresh perspective. As an upper-middle-class family adjusts to life without a patriarch, a mother (Marina de Tavira) and her children become increasingly reliant on their live-in housekeeper, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), for comfort and order, not realizing that Cleo’s life is in heartbreaking disarray. “Roma” feels like Cuarón’s long-overdue acknowledgment of his own caretaker’s private hardships, shot through with overwhelming passion and stylistic brio.[Read the New York Times review.]ImageRami Malek, center, as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.”CreditAlex Bailey/20th Century Fox‘Bohemian Rhapsody’Won for: actor, editing, sound editing, sound mixingHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.Despite controversies over its original director’s behavior and its casual relationship to the band’s actual history, the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” has survived and thrived this awards seasons by adhering closely to the formula of films like “Walk the Line” and “Ray” and by anchoring itself to a transcendent lead performance. As Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek overcomes a distracting set of prosthetic teeth to project the restless, exuberant artist who defied conventional notions of what rock songs and rock singers could be.[Read the New York Times review.]‘The Favourite’Won for: actressHow to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.With his delectable black comedy, the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tiptoes into the mainstream after a series of odd, misanthropic art films like “Dogtooth,” “The Lobster” and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” but he hasn’t entirely buffed out their serrated edges. In the rivalry between two women (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz), who are fighting for influence over an ailing Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Lanthimos and his screenwriters, Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, reveal the corrosive influence of power, but they have a lot of fun doing it. As the queen, Colman is especially good at playing a woman who may be deteriorating but knows how to get what she wants.[Read the New York Times review.]‘BlacKkKlansman’Won for: adapted screenplayHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.The director Spike Lee has a reputation for audacity and provocation that carries over to this fact-based film about a black cop in Colorado Springs named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), who infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan chapter in the early 1970s. But what stands out about “BlacKkKlansman” is how expertly Lee modulates tone, playing up the fish-out-of-water absurdity of Stallworth’s operation while suggesting a history of white supremacy in America that continues to manifest itself today. Adam Driver embodies that tonal duality as Stallworth’s partner, alternately a source of gravitas and comic relief.

As Erik Killmonger, the chief threat to the techno-utopian African nation of Wakanda, Michael B. Jordan plays a villain whose motives are so complex that the word “villain” seems like too narrow a descriptor.[Read the New York Times review.]‘A Star is Born’Won for: original songHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.All four iterations of “A Star is Born” are fascinating era-specific snapshots of the entertainment industry, and with his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper contends with an ascendant moment for female pop artists and the star-making machinery that sustains them. As a drag-bar singer discovered by a hard-drinking stadium rocker (Cooper), Lady Gaga’s Ally begins the film as a raw, unproven, unvarnished talent and ends it looking closer to the glammed-up superstar Gaga has become in the real world. Her performance of the Oscar-winning song “Shallow” is the bridge that gets her there, an electrifying howl that sets the trajectories of her and her benefactor in opposite directions.[Read the New York Times review.]ImageAlex Honnold, the subject of “Free Solo.”CreditJimmy Chin/National Geographic‘Free Solo’Won for: documentaryHow to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.Alex Honnold is not only one of the best climbers in the world, he is also one of tiny fraction of climbers who specialize in “free soloing,” which involves ascending a rock face without ropes or any other form of safety gear. “Free Solo” chronicles Honnold’s extraordinary effort to scale El Capitan, a 3,000-foot granite rock in Yosemite National Park. As Honnold prepares for the big day, the film also takes a keen interest in his romantic life, which both he and his partner know can be extinguished by one small, tragic misstep.[Read the New York Times review.]‘First Man’Won for: visual effectsHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.Damien Chazelle’s follow-up to “La La Land,” his swooning valentine to the movie musical, more closely resembles the film that preceded it, “Whiplash,” in its visceral attention to the rigors and ardors of achieving greatness. Unlike other films about the space program, “First Man” doesn’t romanticize mankind’s ascent to the heavens, and it doesn’t give the famously reticent Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) some hidden depth that had never been accessed before. It’s more concerned with giving viewers a powerful, you-are-there impression of men rattling through the sky in crude vessels, not knowing if they will ever make it back to Earth.[Read the New York Times review.]"
5c71a0013a125f5075c0b321,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/movies/stanley-donen-best-movies.html,"The movie director Stanley Donen died Thursday at 94. From the moment he and Gene Kelly rose up together from dance choreography to film direction with “On the Town,” Donen specialized in constructing bright, Technicolor productions around top Hollywood talent, including Kelly, Fred Astaire, Audrey Hepburn, and Cary Grant.He also showed a willingness to expand the form, whether venturing off the studio backlot to shoot in real locations or experimenting in new techniques.[Read our obituary of Stanley Donen.]More than anything, though, Donen can lay claim to a wealth of joyous and innovative dance sequences, from the title number to “Singin’ in the Rain” to Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling in “Royal Wedding” to the raucous, CinemaScope barn-raising showdown in “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.” Here are nine films that follow the trajectory of his colorful, cosmopolitan career. ‘On the Town’Donen’s first feature, co-directed by Gene Kelly, extended their collaboration as choreographers on 1944’s “Anchors Aweigh,” which was also about sailors on leave and also starred Kelly and Frank Sinatra.While a top-of-the-line studio production — adapted from Betty Comden and Adolph Green’s Broadway musical, with a Leonard Bernstein score — Donen and Kelly nonetheless made baby steps away from the lot, staging its most famous number (“New York, New York, it’s a wonderful town/ The Bronx is up but the Battery’s down”) on location and making the camera itself a fluid partner in the choreography.As sailors who spend 24 sleepless hours touring New York City, each with a dame on his arm, Kelly, Sinatra and Jules Munshin sing and dance with an unfettered enthusiasm that the city, in its mercy, never punctures.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Royal Wedding’As a pretense to romance and song-and-dance numbers, Donen’s first solo feature is awfully thin, following a brother-sister dance act on a ship from New York to London, where their theatrical bow will coincide with the Royal Wedding.But the frivolity yields two signature Fred Astaire solo numbers: “Sunday Jumps,” in which he rehearses in the gym, with a coat rack as his partner, and “You’re All the World to Me,” which finds his character so lovestruck that he dances on the walls and ceilings. In both cases, Donen keeps the camera at enough of a distance to appreciate and complement the fullness of Astaire’s performance.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Singin’ in the Rain’Donen and Kelly reunited for what has grown into the consensus favorite for the greatest musical ever made, and for good reason. At least three of the numbers in “Singin’ in the Rain” are all-time greats, divvied up evenly among its stars: Kelly splashing around, with and without an umbrella, in the title number; Donald O’Connor clowning through the vaudeville silliness of “Make ‘Em Laugh;” and Debbie Reynolds cheerfully greeting a new day with “Good Morning.”Yet there’s unusual richness in the plotting, too, which ingeniously and often hilariously parodies Hollywood’s awkward transition from silents to sound. Kelly, O’Connor, and Reynolds are a joyous team, and Jean Hagen, as a silent star with an unfortunate voice, plays their glamorous foil to perfection.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Seven Brides for Seven Brothers’Look past the absurdly sexist premise of swarthy backwoodsmen abducting women for marriage — the source material can be traced back to Ancient Roman legend “The Rape of the Sabine Women” — and there’s plenty of admire about Donen’s robust CinemaScope musical.Working with choreographer Michael Kidd, Donen scales up “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers” by accommodating its large, color-coded ensemble with ambitious, screen-filling dance sequences, set against a handsome backlot frontier. A barn-raising contest between the backwoodsmen and their gentlemen rivals, for example, turns into half-balletic, half-acrobatic display of one-upmanship.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘It’s Always Fair Weather’Three years after “Singin’ in the Rain” set the standard for Technicolor buoyancy, Kelly and Donen shifted gears with this surprisingly sober treatment of World War II veterans which subverts the three-buddies-in-the-city dynamic of “On the Town” by having Kelly and his two friends experience a more fraught reunion 10 years after the war. Bonds made in wartime have frayed in peacetime, and the men have each had their troubles adapting to civilian life.Nonetheless, the film packs in some wonderful musical sequences, including Cyd Charisse setting tongues wagging in a boxing hall with “Baby You Knock Me Out” and Kelly performing “I Like Myself” on roller-skates.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Funny Face’Audrey Hepburn. Fred Astaire. George and Ira Gershwin. Sometimes filmmaking needn’t be so difficult. Reprising his role from the Broadway musical 30 years earlier, Astaire stars as a Richard Avedon-like fashion photographer who sees potential in Hepburn’s modest bookstore clerk from the Village.Astaire and Hepburn are an odd romantic pair to say the least — they were decades apart in age — but Donen underplays that aspect of their relationship to focus on their musical partnership, which is exuberant at times and gently swooning whenever Gershwin pops up on the soundtrack. The location shooting that brought “New York, New York” to life in Donen’s “On the Town” is doubly effective in “Bonjour, Paris,” a number that hits every tourist spot in the city.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Indiscreet’In retrospect, “Indiscreet” feels like a warm-up for the later film “Charade,” with Cary Grant cast in both as a diabolically charming cad who wins over a skeptical heart.Working as usual in beautiful Technicolor, Donen adapts Norman Krasna’s play “Kind Sir” into a handsome chamber piece about a popular actress (Ingrid Bergman) who takes a chance on a married man (Grant), only to discover that he’s not telling her the full truth, either. While Donen luxuriates in the glamour of two Hollywood stars in evening wear, Grant and especially Bergman trade on more than their charm, digging into characters whose romantic chemistry hinges precariously on trust.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon Video, Google Play and YouTube.‘Charade’Poised somewhere between a Hitchcockian thriller like “North by Northwest” and a classic screwball comedy, Donen’s wildly entertaining play on the spy movie is a Technicolor bauble that feels aligned with the emerging spirit of the French New Wave.The deliriously clever story whisks Audrey Hepburn’s heroine into danger and adventure when her husband dies under dubious circumstances and three of his former OSS associates come looking for a missing $250,000. Cary Grant plays a mystery man who comes to her aid and may or may not be in cahoots with the men on her trail.How to watch: Rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Two for the Road’With international cinema undergoing radical changes in the mid-to-late ‘60s, Donen opened up to a more experimental form with “Two for the Road,” a British road drama that dissects a relationship across multiple timelines.When the film begins, Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn are a feuding couple driving their Mercedes roadster on a scenic route to Saint-Tropez, which naturally recalls other road trips from the past, when they were more optimistic about their future together. Working from a script by Frederic Raphael (“Darling,” “Eyes Wide Shut”), Donen cuts freely and intuitively across various points in their romantic history, collapsing time into a complex jumble of happy memories and sour portents of things to come.How to Watch: Rent or purchase on Amazon Prime."

Neither, however, is currently streaming, and nor are any of the other major movie winners except for Netflix’s “Roma,” which won prizes for its director, Alfonso Cuarón, and for best foreign language movie.[Here’s the complete list of Golden Globe winners.]The good news is, plenty of quality movie nominees can be streamed now, and many of the winners arrive online later this month, including “Rhapsody” (Jan. 22), “Star” (Jan. 15) and “The Wife” (Jan. 22), a little-seen film for which Glenn Close won best actress. Meanwhile, nearly all of the TV winners are already on subscription services or available for rental.Here’s a guide to the those major-category nominees and winners that are already a click away, along with excerpts from their New York Times reviews.Movies‘Roma’Won for: Best foreign language, best director.Nominated for: Best screenplay.“Many directors use spectacle to convey larger-than-life events while reserving devices like close-ups to express a character’s inner being. Here, [Alfonso] Cuarón uses both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.)Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.‘BlacKkKlansman’Nominated for: Best drama, best actor in a drama, best supporting actor.“‘BlacKkKlansman’ is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It’s an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.)Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Black Panther’Nominated for: Best drama.“It wouldn’t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.)Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix. Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Eighth Grade’Nominated for: Best actress, musical or comedy.“There are few more poignant, exasperating creatures than teenage girls.

It has a message to deliver, which is as sincere and decent as it is obvious: Mothers need help, sometimes serious help.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.)Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Crazy Rich Asians’Nominated for: Best musical or comedy; best actress, musical or comedy.“‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ a busy, fizzy movie winnowed from Kevin Kwan’s sprawling, dishy novel, sets up a series of clashes — between tradition and individualism, between the heart’s desire and familial duty, between insane wealth and prudent upward mobility — that are resolved with more laughter than tears. There are squalls of intrigue and a melodramatic cloudburst or two, but nothing that threatens to spoil the festivities.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O.

A charismatic minimalist from the start, he has lately — in the haunting ‘All is Lost’ and the mild-mannered ‘Our Souls at Night’ — offered a series of master classes in understatement. At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it’s nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.)Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Beautiful Boy’Nominated for: Best supporting actor.“‘Beautiful Boy,’ rather than plumbing the hard emotional depths of its subject, skates on a surface of sentiment and gauzy visual beauty…But the picturesqueness and the flowing, music-video rhythms of the editing give the film a slick, evasive feel, as if it were too cautious or too cool to confront the worst of what it’s about.” (Click here to read the full Times review by A.O. Scott.)Where to watch: Stream it on Amazon.‘Incredibles 2’Nominated for: Best animated.“Like his superheroes, [Director Brad] Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful ‘Incredibles 2,’ which picks up narratively where the last movie left off.” (Click here to read the full Times review by Manohla Dargis.)Where to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.‘Isle of Dogs’Nominated for: Best animated.“‘Isle of Dogs’ is filled with exquisite illustrations, whimsical flourishes and nostalgic details — old-fashioned labels, computer punch cards — that thicken the texture of its imaginary world.

5c5dde773a125f5075c08c78,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/movies/albert-finney-films-stream.html,"Albert Finney, the distinguished British thespian and five-time Oscar nominee, died Thursday at 82. Although he retired from the screen several years ago (his final film appearance was in the 2012 James Bond film “Skyfall”), he left behind a rich variety of astonishing roles from a career that spanned nearly six decades: the working-class “angry young men” of British films like “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning”; the flawed middle-age men of “Under the Volcano” and “The Browning Version”; and his unforgettable roles in big-budget movie musicals like “Scrooge” and “Annie.”Luckily, many of his most acclaimed performances are streaming right now. Here’s where to find some of his very best.‘Tom Jones’ (1963)ImageWilfrid Lawson, left and Albert Finney in a scene from “Tom Jones.”CreditLopert Pictures Corporation/PhotofestHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon and iTunes.Finney received his first best actor Oscar nomination for this best picture winner. And although it was made with his fellow “angry young men” Tony Richardson (the director) and John Osborne (the screenwriter), “Tom Jones” was a noticeable diversion from much of all their earlier, socially conscious work. Finney stars as the title character, an 18th century ne’er-do-well with a lust for life (among other things). Watching him throw off the shackles of the Serious Actor this early in his career and engage in some good old-fashioned winking and mugging is a blast. This is a cheerfully ribald picture, with hearty doses of sex and slapstick: The Times’s Bosley Crowther called it “a roaring entertainment that develops its own energy as much from its cinematic gusto as from the racy material it presents.”‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (1974)ImageFrom left, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Finney, Rachel Roberts, Wendy Hiller, Denis Quilley, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Lauren Bacall and Martin Balsam in “Murder on the Orient Express.”CreditParamount PicturesHow to watch: Stream it on Amazon; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney’s next Oscar nomination came over a decade later and for a markedly different role, in which he led the peerless ensemble cast of this all-star adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, directed by Sidney Lumet. Donning a French accent and an appropriately pointed mustache, Finney takes on the persona of Christie’s beloved super-sleuth Hercule Poirot, which he seems to see as an acting dare: Can one convey the ornate theatricality inherent the role without overplaying to the camera? Unsurprisingly, he’s up to the challenge, finding humor in the character’s brilliance, anchoring him in something resembling reality, and (perhaps most important) convincingly dominating a room of stage legends and Oscar winners.‘Shoot the Moon’ (1982)ImageFinney and Diane Keaton in ""Shoot the Moon.""CreditMGMHow to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney is by turns, fragile, monstrous, vulnerable and impossible in the complicated role of a novelist who chooses to leave his wife (Diane Keaton) and four daughters for his mistress. But this is no simple breakup: His wife’s subsequent relationship revives jealousy and passion he thought were long gone, and preserving his bonds with his children proves more difficult than he imagined. The film, and Finney’s work in it, brilliantly capture the trickiness of masculinity in its era, in which forward-thinking sensitivity and cave man machismo seemed in constant conflict. Finney’s scenes with Keaton are emotional minefields, but the most heartbreaking moment in the picture finds Finney trying, and failing, to give a birthday gift to his oldest (and angriest) offspring. The Times critic Vincent Canby wrote that Finney “gives the kind of anguished, biting, full-length performance one associates with his best work.”‘The Dresser’ (1983)ImageTom Courtenay, left, and Finney in “The Dresser.”CreditColumbia Pictures/PhotofestHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney and Tom Courtenay both picked up Oscar nominations for this adaptation of the stage play by Ronald Harwood: a two-hander that stars Finney as the veteran stage actor and manager of a Shakespearean company and Courtenay as a longtime backstage dresser who also serves as the actor’s confidante, nursemaid and punching bag. Finney (47 at the time, playing a man much older and more weathered) spent enough time in these provincial English theaters to know his character through and through, and the film feels like a story told from the inside out, full of lived-in moments and offhand accuracy. It’s an actor’s showcase, in which Finney shows us both the virtuosity of the workaday thespian and the demons that drive him.‘Miller’s Crossing’ (1990)ImageFinney in the 1990 Coen Brothers’ film “Miller’s Crossing.”Credit20th Century FoxHow to watch: Stream it on Starz; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney’s juiciest role of the 1990s came to him from the Coen Brothers, who placed the actor (and his considerable gravitas) at the center of this throwback gangster movie. As Leo O’Bannon, an Irish crime boss and political puppeteer, Finney conveys the character’s long-held power in every impatient look and gesture. But he also lets you glimpse, right behind his steely eyes, that he knows it is all slipping away. The Coens indulged Finney’s playful side, not in the role of the tough gangster, but in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo, disguised as an aging female maid who crosses herself when Gabriel Byrne bursts into a ladies’ dressing room.‘Erin Brockovich’ (2000)ImageFinney with Julia Roberts in “Erin Brokovich.""CreditUniversal Pictures How to watch: Stream it on Starz; rent it on iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney’s fifth and final Academy Award nomination was for this drama from director Steven Soderbergh, based on the true story of Erin Brockovich, who led a successful class action suit against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company of California. As Brockovich, Julia Roberts won the Oscar for best actress, and understandably so: It’s a showstopper of a performance, full of big acting moments and emotional high points. But Finney’s quieter work is just as revelatory, capturing the head-down doggedness of this lifelong and (until then) small-time attorney who suddenly finds himself dealing with the both the case of a lifetime and a force of nature intent on seeing it through. Finney deftly captures the character’s frustrations, tenacity and (particularly in his priceless closing scene) good humor.‘Big Fish’ (2003)ImageBilly Crudup, left, with Finney in “Big Fish.""CreditZade Rosenthal/Columbia PicturesHow to Watch: Stream it on Hulu and HBO; rent it on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.Finney found one of his last great roles in Tim Burton’s visually arresting adaptation of the Daniel Wallace novel, fitting comfortably into the baggy pants (and convincing Southern drawl) of Ed Bloom: lover, fighter and spinner of tall tales. The narrative is propelled by his son (Billy Crudup), who hopes to understand who his father really was on the eve of the old man’s death. But the elder Bloom is a bit of a fabulist, and his baroque, convoluted history (starring Ewan McGregor as Finney’s younger self) gives Finney plenty of charming speeches to chew on. And his onscreen death — as well as his funeral, attended by the many colorful characters he brought to such vivid life — feels especially poignant now."

That's in contrast to last Friday and Saturday when he sold just a few albums — an amount Nielsen Music said is too small to report.Typically following a death, a musician's albums sales will jump greatly.On Wednesday, Hussle's major-label debut album, 2018's ""Victory Lap,"" was No. 1 on the iTunes albums chart, while his 2013 mixtape, ""Crenshaw,"" was No. 5. Several of Hussle's songs, including ""Racks In the Middle,"" ''Double Up"" and ""Grinding All My Life,"" have landed on the Spotify and iTunes' charts. By mid-afternoon on Wednesday, 10 of the Top 50 songs on Apple Music belonged to Hussle.Sales for Hussle's songs jumped from 1,000 to 14,000 on Sunday, Nielsen Music said. The next two days he sold 58,000 and 36,000 singles.Hussle averaged close to 2 million audio streams before his death, but on Sunday he earned 10 million audio streams and 57 million on Monday. His video streams jumped from 900,000 to 9.7 million on the day he died.Hussle was just 33 when he was shot and killed in front of his South Los Angeles clothing store Sunday, not far from where the rapper grew up. After a nearly 48-hour manhunt, police arrested a man they say gunned down Hussle.The proud West Coast rapper began his career in the mixtape circuit, selling his albums from the truck of his car in Crenshaw. They were a success and helped him create a buzz and gain respect from rap purists and his peers. In 2010, he placed on hip-hop magazine XXL's ""Freshman Class of 2010"" — a coveted list for up-and-coming hip-hop acts — alongside J. Cole, Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa and others.Jay-Z even bought 100 copies of Hussle's ""Crenshaw"" for $100 each in 2013, and sent him a $10,000 check.But Hussle, once signed to Sony's Epic Records, hit a new peak with ""Victory Lap,"" his critically acclaimed major-label debut album on Atlantic Records that made several best-of lists last year, from Billboard magazine to Complex.At this year's Grammy Awards, ""Victory Lap"" was one of five nominees for best rap album in a year that saw hip-hop dominate the pop charts and streaming services, and debates ensued about which rap albums would get nominated since a number of top stars released projects, including Drake, Eminem, Kanye West, Nas, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Migos and DJ Khaled. Cardi B's ""Invasion of Privacy"" won the honor in February, while the other nominees alongside Hussle were Travis Scott, Pusha T and Mac Miller.""Victory Lap"" has sold 328,000 units based on sales and streams since its February 2018 release. It debuted at No. 4 on Billboard's 200 albums charts and featured collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, Diddy, CeeLo Green and more."

Fans of the 2015 mockumentary “What We Do in the Shadows” are about to find out. The funny Kiwis Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords) and Taika Waititi (the director of “Thor: Ragnarok”) have taken that movie, which they directed, and turned it into a TV series of the same name. The series trades the Wellington vampire roommates of the film for a group of ancient bloodsuckers struggling to adjust to life on Staten Island. But its laughs tend to come from the same source as the film’s: mainly, the vampires’ tendency toward human folly. “Humans are so [expletive] stupid and boring and lazy that given the gift of immortality, you’d never get around to doing anything,” Waititi recently told The New York Times. “You’d just put off everything.

In this debut feature from the writer and director Reinaldo Marcus Green, Washington plays Dennis, an African-American officer in New York who struggles with knowledge of his squad’s racism. He makes up about a third of the narrative here, alongside the “Hamilton” actor Anthony Ramos as a Brooklyn father who witnesses a police shooting and Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays a teenage baseball star turned activist.

The star singers Elina Garanca and Roberto Alagna lead this Metropolitan Opera production of Saint-Saëns’s biblical work, staged last year with old-fashioned extravagance by the director Darko Tresnjak (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder”). The adaptation, in which Garanca plays Dalila to Alagna’s Samson, retells the Old Testament tale of a doomed love affair set in Gaza, with enslaved Israelites suffering under the oppression of the Philistines. The high emotional stakes of the story can make for grand spectacle. But, in his review of this production for The New York Times last year, Anthony Tommasini wrote that Tresnjak’s staging “somehow managed to be both gaudy and dull.” Still, it’s not every Sunday that you can catch a filmed performance from one of the world’s great opera houses for free from the comfort of your couch.ImageLeonardo DiCaprio in “The Revenant.”CreditTwentieth Century FoxTHE REVENANT (2015) 7:45 p.m. on FXM.

After being left for dead on a fur expedition by a cruel companion (Tom Hardy), Glass plods through expansively (and expensively) shot, drop-dead-gorgeous snowy landscapes, bent on revenge. His journey involves intricately choreographed action, a wrestle with a bear and an extremely committed performance from DiCaprio.

The movie was hardly a modest beginning; “Iron Man” represented not only the explosive start of the film franchise but also the revival of Robert Downey Jr.’s acting career.

The adult world is a soul-crushing trap in this live-action Winnie the Pooh tale, with Ewan McGregor as an adult Christopher Robin. It’s postwar Britain, and Christopher’s imagination has been flattened by the gears of professional life and World War II. After a particularly cruel work task forces him to miss a family outing, Christopher (or Mr. Robin, if you like) has a run-in with Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings).

In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that once the movie “softens its insufferable, needlessly cynical conception of the title character, it offers more or less what a Pooh reboot should: a lot of nostalgia, a bit of humor (Brad Garrett’s vocal deadpanning as Eeyore is a standout) and tactile computer animation that, even for the effects-jaded, makes it look as if the actors are interacting with real stuffed animals.”ImageRoss Lynch and Katie Stottlemire in “My Friend Dahmer.”CreditFilmRiseMY FRIEND DAHMER (2017) Stream on HBO platforms; Buy on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.

The director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivists and editors found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission, and compiled it into a film that’s an immersive and inspiring record of the voyage, from launch to splashdown.But “Apollo 11” is far from the only great documentary about humanity’s efforts to explore beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The “space doc” is a small but fertile nonfiction cinema subgenre, populated by filmmakers who often partner with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to combine astonishing images with recollections from the small handful of men and women who have dared to venture to the stars.[Read our review of “Apollo 11,” a Times Critic’s Pick]Here are five of the best of these movies, and how to stream them.‘For All Mankind’ (1989)Image“For All Mankind” was nominated for best documentary, and its imagery is eerie and awe-inspiring.CreditApollo AssociatesHow to watch: Stream it on Kanopy; buy or rent it on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu.The gold standard for NASA documentaries, this Oscar-nominated 1989 film is rich with the alien wonder of a trip to the moon. The director Al Reinert was granted access to footage shot by astronauts during the various Apollo missions, and he and his editors (led by Susan Korda) cut them into an approximation of a single voyage, with a focus on scenes that are eerie and awe-inspiring. With its score by the ambient music pioneers Brian Eno, Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois — and its narration provided by the original Mission Control audio recordings, combined with reflective astronaut interviews — “For All Mankind” evokes the grand science-fiction adventure of Apollo. (For a more straightforward, less experimental account of the program, the 2007 British documentary “In the Shadow of the Moon” is also highly recommended. It’s available to stream for free on the ad-supported Tubi.)[Read the New York Times review.]‘The Last Man on the Moon’ (2016)ImageEugene Cernan in the documentary “The Last Man on the Moon.”CreditNASAHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.As a bittersweet bookend to “Apollo 11,” watch this documentary about the final moon mission, and see how it changed the life of its commander, Eugene Cernan. The director Mark Craig keeps his film fairly equally divided between the personal, professional and political sides of Cernan’s NASA career. “The Last Man on the Moon” covers the public’s growing frustration with the expense of the space program, and also gets into the technical complexities of that last trip in 1972, and into how an astronaut’s job conflicts with family life. This is the rare space-doc that’s also a poignant character sketch. And it doesn’t lack for great lunar footage, either. Apollo 17 had access to color video cameras far beyond what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin worked with, and the images Cernan and his crew captured on the moon are stunning in their clarity.[Read the New York Times review.]‘The Farthest’ (2017)ImageVoyager 2 at Cape Kennedy in 1977, as seen in “The Farthest.”CreditNASA, via PBSHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube.When NASA launched its two deep-space Voyager probes in 1977, the missions sparked conversations among scientists, artists, philosophers and ordinary folks, all wondering what information about Earth should be sent out into the universe, and what data — or even communication — might come back from the distant planets and stars. The director Emer Reynolds’s documentary “The Farthest” describes the work that went into crafting these enduring marvels of mid-’70s technology, which are still zooming away out there. The film is a reminder of the idealism and optimism of the people who worked in the space program over 40 years ago, and serves as a call to recapture their spirit and ingenuity.[Read the New York Times review.]‘The Mars Generation’ (2017)ImageTeenagers participate in camps to simulate space travel in “The Mars Generation.”CreditNetflixHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.Manned space exploration has slowed lately, but the nonprofit organization the Mars Generation has been working since 2015 to keep the next wave of astronauts and rocket scientists ready anyway, just in case. The documentary “The Mars Generation” introduces some brilliant, space-obsessed teens, who take part in special camps designed to simulate what it might be like to travel to and even live on Mars. These kids are sometimes socially awkward, but always sweetly earnest. It’s heartwarming to watch them work together toward a goal they may never achieve in real life, unless the public broadly supports another big, expensive project on the scale of the Apollo missions.‘Mercury 13’ (2018)ImageA scene from “Mercury 13,” about a program to put women in space.CreditNetflixHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.How about a little historical “what if?” In 1960, the NASA adviser Dr. William Randolph Lovelace II began an experiment to see if ace female pilots could endure the series of physical and mental challenges he had originally devised for the “Mercury Seven” astronauts. When he discovered that some women scored higher on some tests than the men, the privately funded “Woman in Space” program started lobbying the media and the U.S. government, arguing that in order to compete with the Soviets in the space race, America needed to overcome its deep-rooted sexism. The documentary “Mercury 13” features interviews with some of the accomplished pilots and scientists who worked on this project, many of whom remain certain that the space program — and perhaps even the culture — might have been different if NASA had been more open to Lovelace’s experiments."

And Ewan McGregor narrates a “Nature” documentary on PBS.What’s StreamingWEIRD CITY Stream on YouTube Premium. A sci-fi potpourri that wears its influences on its sleeves, this new anthology series created by Jordan Peele and the “Key & Peele” writer Charlie Sanders imagines a socially stratified dystopia whose upper- and lower-class citizens are separated by a physical barrier called “the line.” But while it’s dystopian, it’s also funny; the show plays as if “Black Mirror” and Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis” had a love child, and then that child chose a career in comedy. Many recognizable actors — including Steven Yeun, Awkwafina, Dylan O’Brien, LeVar Burton and Rosario Dawson — portray the citizenry of this middle-class-less society.MELANCHOLIA (2011) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. On a pedestal at the M HKA museum in Antwerp, Belgium, sits a diamond, in an exhibition created by the filmmaker Lars von Trier. The diamond, he says, represents his 2011 film, “Melancholia.” “What I’m trying to do is to capture the mood,” von Trier recently told The New York Times. Those who can’t make it to Antwerp can hop on the streaming service of their choice to experience the mood of this apocalyptic psychological drama, which stars Kirsten Dunst as a bride whose doomsday visions come true. It is melancholic and more.ImageKristen Stewart in “Personal Shopper.”CreditCarole Bethuel/IFC FilmsPERSONAL SHOPPER (2017) Stream on Netflix; Rent on iTunes and Vudu.

Set in Paris and throughout Europe, the movie follows Maureen as she travels around as a personal shopper, buying expensive clothes and accessories for her boss while mentally processing the recent death of her twin brother. Mystery, more death, and possible spirits come around soon enough. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film is both “an unnerving inquiry into the drift and mystery of modern life” and “a raw and smoldering study in grief.” He called it “sleek and spooky, seductive and suspenseful.”What’s on TVImageA scene from “Nature: Wild Way of the Vikings.”CreditFiona Donaldson/MaramediaNATURE: WILD WAY OF THE VIKINGS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Seafarers? Yes. Raiders? Check. Traders? Naturally. Environmental stewards? Somewhat, according to this documentary.

David Ayer’s dark DC Comics adaptation assembles a heterogeneous squad of Hollywood heavyweights like Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Viola Davis to tell the tale of supervillains who come under government employ. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott called the film “a so-so, off-peak superhero movie.” But he praised the costumes and Smith and Davis’s “dead-serious, delightfully mischievous performances.”"

Although Christmas is over, it’s hard to wean yourself from holiday movies. Now that Valentine’s Day is approaching, a Christmas-themed film about love might help you get ready for February’s celebration. With a star-studded cast — Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Keira Knightley, among others — the film follows several intertwining love stories, including that of a prime minister who falls for a young staffer, and one about a marriage on the brink and plagued by infidelity. Despite a few questionable subplots involving a young woman and a much older man in a position of power, which prompted the critic A. O. Scott to label the movie’s portrayal of love “shallow and dishonest” in The New York Times, the feature remains a cult classic and even received an unorthodox 15-minute sequel nearly 15 years later.FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. In this film, based on H. G. Bissinger’s 1990 nonfiction book, the director Peter Berg brings the small town of Odessa, Tex., where football reigns, to the screen. Here, the game takes precedence over everything, rivaling religion. Inspired by the Permian High Panthers’ 1988 season, the movie offers glimpses into the personal lives of the boys tasked with upholding their town’s honor, like the star quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), who is the victim of an abusive father (Tim McGraw). The players, as well as their coach (Billy Bob Thornton), must learn to navigate the pressures of being hometown heroes. Berg went on to create a television series of the same title, writing and directing its pilot episode."

That sentiment couldn’t have been stronger this week at CES, the largest consumer electronics convention in the country. The conference, which brought more than 180,000 people to Las Vegas, was a reminder of what the tech industry is best at: being optimistic about itself.ImageCreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesWho cares about the abysmal stock market and growing fears that we are sliding into a recession?

The conference offered a peek at the year’s hottest tech trends, including artificially intelligent virtual assistants, next-generation wireless networks and connected cars.ImageMengze Han taking a break in the South Hall.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesAnd companies unveiled thousands of products.

People will be able to speak to Siri on their iPhones to play content they had purchased from iTunes on the Vizio TVs. Samsung, Sony and LG announced similar partnerships with Apple.In the past, AirPlay and iTunes videos were mostly tied to Apple-made hardware like the Apple TV set-top box. Their expansion to third parties underlines Apple’s ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services. That’s especially important now that sales of Apple’s cash cow, the iPhone, are slowing. This month, the company reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years.The move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by Apple to open its technology to other companies, including competitors like Samsung.In a statement provided by Samsung, Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet software and services, said that with the expansion of iTunes and AirPlay, “iPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home.”ImageInteracting with facial-recognition software.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesFront and center at CES was the battle between virtual assistants — namely Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant. Google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with Assistant, including smart watches, speakers and displays. The company said a billion devices now work with its assistant, up from 400 million last year. Google wants to make the Assistant the focal point of a consumer’s life: in the home, in the car and on mobile devices.“When I walk down the aisle at Home Depot, will all the devices I might buy work with the Assistant?” Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant, said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats. “The answer is yes.”Amazon also had a large presence at the show. It filled a large conference room at the Venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with Alexa, including an Audi car, a motorcycle helmet and a stereo system.The battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices. Many of the smart gadgets at CES worked with multiple virtual assistants. Aaron Emigh, chief executive of Brilliant, which makes smart home products that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together, not against one another, because the smart home was already too complex, with products like light switches, thermostats and cameras coming from different brands.“The more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home, the more important that it all works together,” he said.ImageAmazon's Alexa technology made its way into car dashboards.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesCar manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and 5G wireless connections. But consumers won’t be able to buy self-driving vehicles from a dealership anytime soon, in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars. Smarter cars with features like built-in voice assistants to help people use maps, play music or get a sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now, however.If the economy does cool off, sales of cutting-edge gadgets will drop. Fast. But that didn’t faze people here. None of the CES attendees I spoke to expressed concern.Matt Strauss, who oversees Comcast’s Xfinity internet and cable service, was especially bullish about the year ahead. He said just about everything announced at CES required an internet connection, so that’s the last thing that people would cut off. “It’s become like oxygen,” he said."

Others have had something else in mind: Winter is coming. That tagline for HBO’s fantasy colossus, which has grown bigger and bigger since its 2011 debut, has reached peak relevance in the lead-up to the show’s eighth season, which promises a final showdown between the living and the undead White Walkers (who have an ice dragon!). Season 8 should tie up loose ends while answering the big question of who will ultimately win the throne? Regardless of the answer, the brand is all but guaranteed to actively live on. “Five years from now,” the “Thrones” star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau recently told The New York Times, “We will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land.”ImageDominic West, left, and David Oyelowo in “Les Miserables.”CreditLaurence Cendrowicz/BBCLES MISÉRABLES 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).

The writer Ryan O’Connell made a name for himself blogging on the pop culture lifestyle site Thought Catalog, then released a memoir, “I’m Special, and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves,” about his experiences as a disabled gay 20-something. That book provides the basis for this new dark comedy series, which stars O’Connell (a first-time actor) playing a version of himself, with roughly 15-minute-long episodes. The series’s overarching joke “is on people who aren’t disabled, and how they view disabled people,” he recently told The Times. O’Connell said that “giving them a show like ‘Special,’ which is funny and I’m the one making the jokes and I’m the one writing them — I think it makes them feel at ease. They’re like ‘Oh O.K., this isn’t some scary thing. Disabled people are just like me!’ I don’t know why this a revolutionary concept. I just think they don’t know what to do with us at all.”STEVE JOBS: THE MAN IN THE MACHINE (2015) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.

In his review for The Times, Nicolas Rapold wrote that Gibney’s film “is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs.” But, he noted, “even if this isn’t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across.”"

Chu said he wanted the film to be “the ‘Avengers’ of Asian actors.”) Constance Wu stars as Rachel, a middle-class economics professor at New York University who joins her boyfriend, Nick (Henry Golding), on a trip to Singapore, whereupon she learns that his family is among the richest in the country. The differences between her upbringing and his become hard to ignore — Nick’s judgmental mother (Michelle Yeoh) flat-out tells Rachel she isn’t right for her son — but our heroine refuses to go down without a fight. For those craving more crazy, rich fun, a sequel based on Kwan’s second book in the series is already in the works.ImageSanjay Gupta, center, in “Chasing Life.”CreditCNNCHASING LIFE WITH DR.

The South Korean boy band will perform songs off their new album, “Map of the Soul: Persona,” and are likely to make a splash: Their third album, 2018’s “Love Yourself: Tear,” was the first K-pop release to debut atop the Billboard album chart.

The most steadfast of the bunch, Maria (Isabelle Huppert), wants to finish harvesting her crops, but her former husband Andre (Christopher Lambert) and his father, the patriarch of the plantation, are desperate to flee before the violence inches closer.

And Netflix releases the next season of “The OA.”What’s StreamingCOLD WAR (2018) Stream on Amazon. This latest black-and-white film from the Oscar-winning Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski packs a decades-long romance into a swift 89 minutes. That it includes Polish, French, German, Russian, Italian and Croatian dialogue hints at its country-hopping nature. It begins in the Polish countryside at the end of the 1940s, when a musician, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), and his colleague, Irena (Agata Kulesza), travel among villages recording the music of the people living there. While traveling, Wiktor meets Zula (Joanna Kulig), a singer. Romance ignites between them amid a thorny political landscape. They struggle to navigate that landscape — together and apart and together again — for years after, in several European countries. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film’s “two knockout leads” and the cinematography, which, she wrote, “is filled with ordinary and surprising beauty, with gleaming and richly textured surfaces, and the kind of velvety black chiaroscuro you can get lost in.”ImageBrit Marling in “The OA.”CreditNicola Goode/NetflixTHE OA Stream on Netflix. The second season of “The OA” takes place in a new city — and a new dimension. Created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, this puzzling thriller series introduced the young Prairie Johnson (Marling) in her small hometown in Michigan after she had been missing for several years. Calling herself, mysteriously, “the OA,” she gathered a group of teenagers and one teacher (Phyllis Smith) for a “mission” that culminated in a polarizing end. Those attracted to the series’ narrative risks will like the complicated setup of Season 2: After jumping into another dimension, Marling’s character finds herself in San Francisco as a wealthy heiress. She teams up with a private detective (Kingsley Ben-Adir) to investigate a teenager’s disappearance. And in the dimension where Season 1 took place, the teenagers and their teacher try to pick up the pieces.THE LAST RACE (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This slim documentary looks at speed and those who pursue it at Riverhead Raceway, the last remaining car racetrack on Long Island, which once bursted with them. Mixing racing footage with film of the drivers working their day jobs, the documentary is more or less equally interested in the racing and the culture that surrounds it.

This sophomore feature from the Singaporean filmmaker Siew Hua Yeo won the top prize at last year’s Locarno International Film Festival, a Swiss festival with a long history of supporting Asian cinema. The film, a thriller, concerns the disappearance of a worker at construction site in Singapore. While it initially centers on the detective investigating the case (Peter Yu), it soon shifts its focus away from that noirish setup to follow the worker, Wang (Xiaoyi Liu), an insomniac immigrant from China, in the lead-up to his disappearance.ImageKiKi Layne and Stephan James in “If Beale Street Could Talk.”CreditAnnapurna PicturesIF BEALE STREET COULD TALK (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Barry Jenkins’s follow up to his Oscar-winning “Moonlight” creates vivid, rhythmic onscreen life out of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel of love interrupted by injustice. Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) are the lovers in question; they were also childhood friends. Their attempts to live and love in peace repeatedly push up against the racism around them, culminating in a false criminal accusation that lands Fonny in prison. As the film dances between Tish and Fonny’s stories pre- and post-arrest, Jenkins builds up a picture of love in 1970s New York that is both beautiful and infuriating. “This is a period piece about New York,” Jenkins told The New York Times earlier this year. “It’s James Baldwin’s sometimes acrimonious love letter to New York, but a love letter nonetheless.” Regina King, who plays Tish’s mother, won an Oscar for her acting in the film.HUGE IN FRANCE Stream on Netflix. Not many people move to Los Angeles to shed their celebrity status. That’s not exactly what the French comedian Gad Elmaleh does in this series, either — but moving there does have that effect. The premise of the show involves Elmaleh (who plays a version of himself) moving to the States in hopes of reconnecting with his teenage son (Jordan Ver Hoeve). He arrives to a child more interested in his modeling career than his funnyman father, and many variations on the greeting “Aren’t you popular in, like, France or something?”What’s on TVImageDenzel Washington in “The Magnificent Seven.”CreditSam Emerson/Sony PicturesTHE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (2016) 8 p.m. on USA. This remake of the 1960 film “The Magnificent Seven” — itself based on Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” — is, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, “as fresh as recycled recycling suggests.” But watching Denzel Washington, its star, lead a band of misfits on a revolver-toting frolic through the Old West is still a fun outing.AMERICAN MASTERS: JOSEPH PULITZER 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).

Hellboy, the cigar-chomping, lobster-colored satanic superhero born of Mike Mignola’s comics in the 1990s, was brought to larger audiences by this Guillermo del Toro-directed romp. Wittier and infused with a sweeter disposition than the average big-screen comic book adaptation — though still plenty violent — del Toro’s movie casts Ron Perlman (“Sons of Anarchy”) as the title character, a demon with a devil tail whose origins involve both Grigori Rasputin and an interdimensional portal built by Nazis. (It’s complicated.) He winds up working for a government agency (secret, naturally) that defends against paranormal threats. His fellow agents there include an amphibious man played by Doug Jones (who would later play another fish-man in del Toro’s “The Shape of Water”) and a woman with pyrotechnic abilities (Selma Blair). In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote that del Toro “lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable.” It will be interesting to see what the director Neil Marshall brings to the series when his reboot, also called “Hellboy,” hits theaters on Friday.What’s StreamingImageMati Diop and Grégoire Colin in “35 Shots of Rum.”CreditFilm Society of Lincoln Center35 SHOTS OF RUM (2009) Stream on Fandor. The French filmmaker Claire Denis, whose “High Life” has a spaceship-dwelling Robert Pattinson currently brooding on the big screens, turned her attention to more terrestrial concerns in this slow-burner. The movie centers on Lionel (Alex Descas), a widower who operates commuter rail cars for a living, and Joséphine (Mati Diop), his university student daughter. The pair live together in a non-central Paris neighborhood, going through quiet routines that get rocked slightly by the romantic attentions of a pair of neighbors, Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) and Noé (Grégoire Colin). While a slow separation between father and daughter is the film’s clearest focus, A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times that “its real drama is in quiet moments, in glances and whispers captured by Agnès Godard’s exquisite and expressive cinematography.”TYREL (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Jason Mitchell plays the odd man out on a nightmarish retreat to the Catskills in this comedy-drama. What was supposed to be an innocuous birthday party for a friend of a friend turns into something more sinister, thanks in part to the fact that the flock of partyers are young white men whose drunk antics do little to help Tyler (who is black) feel like anything other than an outsider. Michael Cera arrives late in the movie, as a rich kid with a Trump piñata.ImageJaime King in “Black Summer.”CreditNetflixBLACK SUMMER Stream on Netflix.

Opportunity arrives when a wealthy white businessman, Henry Dalton (Bill Camp), offers him $1,000 a week to be his chauffeur, and suddenly Bigger is thrust into a world of money, luxury and power. His hopes for a better life collapse, though, when a night alone with Henry’s spoiled daughter (Margaret Qualley) ends in tragedy. James Baldwin was famously hostile toward Wright’s novel; he argued that Bigger’s character perpetuated the stereotype that black men are predisposed to violence. And that view didn’t go unnoticed. “Baldwin’s criticism is unavoidable,” Johnson said in an interview with The New York Times. He added: “I mean, now, Wright and Baldwin are so matched together, that it would be foolish and disingenuous to tell the story without taking into account what we know.”TRUE LOVE BLOOMS (2019) 8 p.m. on Hallmark.

That memory stuck with her, and here she gives it a twist: Rue plays Vikki, an urban gardener who fights to save her plot of land from a hunky real estate developer (Jordan Bridges) who threatens to replace it with condos.

CDs are now a mere niche, and positions on Billboard’s weekly album chart are largely determined by billions of clicks on streaming services, each worth just a fraction of a penny.But this week, the Backstreet Boys — its five members now well into their 30s and 40s — benefited from the music industry’s last-ditch strategy to move CDs: concert-ticket sales bundles. Following in the footsteps of Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, Bon Jovi and the Dave Matthews Band, the Backstreet Boys offered fans copies of their latest album, “DNA” (K-BAHN/RCA), with tickets to their summer tour.That deal helped sell 227,000 copies of “DNA” in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. Back in 2000 that amount would have barely made a dent; the Backstreet Boys’ “Black & Blue” sold 1.6 million copies in its first week on sale that November.But in the chart’s new math, sales of complete albums now carry far greater weight than any single click. So even though “DNA” had just 6.6 million streams, the album sales put it far ahead of any other release this week, with 234,000 total “equivalent” album sales — a measurement that factors in complete album sales as well as streams and downloads of individual tracks.By comparison, the latest album by the rapper Future, “The Wizrd,” had a healthy 69 million streams in its second week out, yet only 3,000 sales as a full album, yielding an equivalent number of just 56,000. “The Wizrd,” last week’s chart-topper, fell to No. 2.Also this week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” holds at No. 3, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” soundtrack is No. 4, and Weezer’s latest untitled album — this one known as the “teal” album, with covers like Toto’s “Africa” and TLC’s “No Scrubs” — is No. 5."

And “Brockmire” is back for a third season on IFC.What’s on TVYOU’RE THE WORST 10 p.m. on FXX.  As do many comedies, this bawdy sitcom ends its final season with a marriage. Probably. In the previous season, Gretchen (Aya Cash), a publicist with clinical depression, ditched a riskless relationship and proposed to her more exciting (if uncongenial) writer love interest, Jimmy (Chris Geere). The lead-up to the wedding this season has been peppered with flash-forwards suggesting the two may not ultimately be bound in holy matrimony — but as of now, the wedding is still on. In his review of the season for The New York Times, Mike Hale called the show “one of the most twisted, acidulous and sex-drenched” romantic comedies on TV, writing that Wednesday’s finale “answers the questions and satisfies the emotions without short-selling the serious issues.”ImageFrom left, Zoe Saldana, Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista in “Guardians of the Galaxy.”CreditMarvel Studios and Walt Disney PicturesGUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) 7:30 p.m. on FX. The ’80s nostalgia pours out like stuffing from a ripped Cabbage Patch Kids doll in this witty Marvel space comedy. Chris Pratt stars as a charming galactic cowboy, alongside Zoe Saldana as an elite assassin and Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper — who do the voices of an animated tree-man and racoonish bounty hunter. The movie plainly shares some D.N.A. with the sci-fi parody GALAXY QUEST (1999), which is coincidentally showing at 8:30 p.m. and 10:45 p.m. on BBC America. That film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman as members of a crew of actors from a canceled cult sci-fi series who are thrust into an actual space war. Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times in 1999 that “Galaxy Quest” spoofs franchises like “Star Trek” while also managing to “replicate the very elements that have made them so durable.” That applies to “Guardians of the Galaxy,” too.ImageFrom left, Tawny Newsome, Richard Kind and Hank Azaria in “Brockmire.”CreditKim Simms/IFCBROCKMIRE 10 p.m. on IFC. Spring training season is upon Jim Brockmire, the disgraced sports announcer played by Hank Azaria in this comedy series. The start of Season 3 has Brockmire gearing up for a big opportunity: taking over as an anchor for the Oakland Athletics. Anyone who saw where “Brockmire” began knows how big a jump that is. The first season started with Azaria’s character having a career-breaking meltdown during a live broadcast, then cut forward years later, with Brockmire deciding to get back in the game. This season Brockmire is working alongside a new co-host, Gabby (Tawny Newsome), and delivering lines like “It is a beautiful spring afternoon for baseball here at King Venom Vape Cartridge Stadium.”What’s StreamingTHE SHINING (1980) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In her review of Jordan Peele’s “Us” for The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that “The Shining” serves as Peele’s “most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually.” Peele’s homages are of course just the latest flashes of this Stanley Kubrick horror film’s enduring influence. It’s the kind of movie where even the opening credits — projected over snaking aerial shots of a yellow Volkswagen — are distinctive."

The “Run, Selina, Run” signs are out for Selina Meyer, the onetime president played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus in HBO’s farcical political comedy series, which returns Sunday for a seventh and final season. Meyer is back on the campaign trail, but she doesn’t go around kissing babies (though she does make one cry). Instead, she ponders ways to spin fictional mass shootings into political assets and throws her cellphone on the ground in disgust after her staffers fly her to the wrong Iowa town. “America owes me an eight-year stay in the White House,” she says later. “And this time, I want a war.”MRS. WILSON 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Ruth Wilson, a star of “The Affair” and “Luther,” plays a fictionalized version of her own grandmother in this mini-series. It’s a mysterious story of secrets and clandestine operations that begins in 1963, when Alison Wilson (Ruth Wilson) meets her deceased husband’s wife. Yes, you read that right: Iain Glen (“Game of Thrones”) plays that husband, a writer and former MI6 agent who dies in the first minutes of the story, leaving behind a tangle of secrets, including a hidden double life. Unraveling the mysteries becomes Alison’s occupation, and the focus of the mini-series.

In the first season, Barry eventually traded killing for newfound love. The second season continues the story — so it seems his redemption was short lived.BLACK MONDAY 10 p.m. on Showtime. The crash will finally come in the Season 1 finale of this drug-fueled parody of 1980s Wall Street, which stars Don Cheadle, Regina Hall, Andrew Rannells and Paul Scheer as members of a scrappy brokerage firm.

The plot, based on Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew,” involves a marching band, a prom and the pursuit of forbidden love. “It’s projecting a fantasy of a high school experience,” Oleynik told The Times recently. “But it’s also grounded in what most 17-year-olds are still feeling, what I’m still feeling as a 37-year-old.”"

A. O. Scott, who wrote about “Unquiet” for the Book Review, joins us on the podcast this week to discuss the novel. Scott points out that between biographies of Bergman and memoirs written by Liv Ullmann, much is known about the two, but that the novel offers a unique perspective.“A lot of their own accounts of their own lives and the details are available and accessible, and I’m not sure that this adds very much to that,” Scott says, “except that you kind of see them through the eyes of a child, which is something you hadn’t before. So you see their vulnerability, their cruelty, their carelessness all these ways that parents can be around their children that great artists never allow themselves to be in public.”ImageJudith Newman also visits us this week, to discuss her review of new books about dealing with anxiety, mental illness and grief, including “How Not to Fall Apart: Lessons Learned on the Road From Self-Harm to Self-Care,” by Maggy Van Eijk. “I think that for people who have a kid who’s in a lot of pain,” Newman says, “this would be a good book to give them.”Also on this episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Lovia Gyarkye, Joumana Khatib and Sarah Lyall talk about what people are reading.

He even flagellates himself with a paddle.In one montage, Astor prowls the Los Angeles dating scene, attempting to break the ice with every woman at the bar by flashing a $50 bill. Curiously, it is set to a melancholy Ronald Stein tune from the 1960 film “The Threat,” as if to elicit sympathy for Astor’s obnoxiousness. Scenes in which he repeatedly harasses his ex Valerie (Molly C. Quinn) leave no doubt, however, that Astor is a tool. He appears agreeable only in meetings and conference calls pertaining to his film, even if his colleagues find one of his artistic choices exploitative.via YouTubeCreditCreditVideo by Newly Single - TrailerAstor’s sister, Madeline (Anna Jacoby-Heron), has little screen time but imparts the film’s most resonant wisdom. One of Astor’s casual sex partners, Izzy (Jennifer Kim), a Korean American who dates white guys exclusively, emerges as the most complex and intriguing character even as her back story remains unexplored.An examination of the unconscious racial bias embedded in Izzy and Astor’s interactions would have made for a more revelatory take on relationship dysfunctions. Still, Izzy’s despair and self-loathing force Astor to confront his own, redeeming an often insufferable protagonist and ultimately salvaging the film.“Newly Single” is currently renting at Amazon, iTunes, Google Play and YouTube.

The question has been considered in works like the Austrian playwright Peter Handke’s drama “Kaspar,” about a 19th-century German who claimed to have grown up without any human contact, and “Captain Fantastic,” the 2016 feature that cast Viggo Mortensen as a father who lived with his children in the woods. But “Hanna,” a 2011 thriller, asked it with a fresh angle: what if someone were raised outside of society — to be a meticulous killer? The movie cast Saoirse Ronan in the role of Hanna, a teenager whose father trained her in the wilderness to be an assassin. This new adaptation, created and written by David Farr (a writer of the original movie), puts a new spin on the tale, with Hanna (now played by Esme Creed-Miles) hunting and being hunted by a C.I.A. agent (Mireille Enos).HURLEY (2019) Rent on Amazon, Fandango Now, Google Play, iTunes and Vudu. Near the beginning of this documentary, the driver Hurley Haywood is asked what makes him a legend of Daytona. He offers a basic response: “I guess the fact that I won it five times.” Haywood is a soft-spoken racer who rose to fame in the 1970s, after he won the two best-known 24-hour races, Daytona and Le Mans, in the same year. But the documentary focuses on another fact about him: Throughout his career, he had hid his sexuality. Through interviews and archival footage, the film reframes Haywood’s life as the story of a closeted gay man in the hyper-macho world of late-20th-century auto racing.ImageWoody Harrelson, left, and Kevin Costner in “The Highwaymen.”CreditMerrick Morton/NetflixTHE HIGHWAYMEN (2019) Stream on Netflix. The buddy cops have streaks of gray hair in this based-on-true-events crime drama, which stars Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner as two older Texas Rangers in the 1930s. They’re given the job of tracking down Bonnie and Clyde, the infamous criminals who were turned into romantic outsiders — a reputation cemented by the landmark 1967 film named for them. This drama instead romanticizes the authorities. “‘Bonnie and Clyde’ magnified the mystique of ’30s bank robbers by refracting it through the lens of counterculture revolt,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review of “The Highwaymen” for The New York Times. “This movie opposes that one with every fiber of its ornery being, including by its insistence on procedural tedium over cinematic excitement.”What’s on TVImageCharlize Theron in “Snow White and the Huntsman.”CreditAlex Bailey/Universal PicturesSNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN (2012) 10:30 p.m. on TNT. “There is nothing cute about this movie,” A.

Episodes of NBC’s newest sitcom begin with this twist on a common preshow message: “‘Abby’s’ was filmed before a live outdoor audience.” And it’s true; this multicamera sitcom, created by Josh Malmuth (a writer and producer of the now-over Zooey Deschanel sitcom “New Girl”), stars Natalie Morales (“Parks and Recreation”) as a former Marine who builds a bar in her backyard. Its regulars quickly come to include characters (in every sense) played by Neil Flynn (“The Middle”), Nelson Franklin (“Veep”) and Jessica Chaffin (“Search Party”). While the idea of a tavern peppered with weirdos is well established (see “Cheers”), the show’s outdoor filming promises to shake up the convention, something that the camera makes a point of reminding viewers of when it occasionally peels away to show the live crowd. “You see the audience; you see that we’re, like, literally on the side of a cliff in Universal Studios; you see the Los Angeles city lights; and then you see us on this weird little outdoor set, acting,” Morales recently told The New York Times. “It’s going to feel familiar, but it’s also going to feel very novel.”ImageDan Stevens, left, and Emma Watson in “Beauty and the Beast.”CreditDisneyBEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017) 8 p.m. on TNT.

Its romance neither winks nor panders,” A. O.

At 30, Michael Cera may have outgrown some of the roles that defined him, such as the awkward slacker in “Superbad” or the sweet boyfriend in “Juno.” As the sulking musician in “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” he plays a New Jersey high school student recently dumped by his girlfriend (Alex Dziena). Still hurting from the breakup, he reluctantly heads to Manhattan to play a show and meets Norah (Kat Dennings), who instantly catches his eye. They spend the night searching for their favorite indie band’s concert, but their friends and former lovers keep getting in the way. The movie, A. O.

A fellow actor helps them settle in a new place, but the previous tenant left behind many belongings and doesn’t seem to be returning for them. Emad and Rana soon understand why the apartment is filled with clutter, but only after a troubling incident causes a rift between them and pushes Emad down a vengeful spiral. A. O.

The tale is mostly seen through the eyes of Jonah (Evan Rosado), the youngest of three brothers who, as he inches toward 10, is growing up to be the more sensitive of the bunch. While his siblings start to take to their unpredictable father, Jonah breaks away into a fantasy world of his own and watches his parents’ volatile relationship with caution. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis named the movie a Critic’s Pick and called it “fragile yet resilient.”THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) stream on Netflix; rent on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. In hindsight, this buddy comedy can come off as crass, outdated or juvenile. But it’s worth revisiting for its cast of rising stars and an endearing lead performance by a wide-eyed Steve Carell.What’s on TVImageDelta Goodrem in “Hopelessly Devoted to You.”CreditJackson FinterOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. When rumors surfaced that Olivia Newton-John was on her deathbed last month after her third bout of breast cancer, the 70-year-old Australian singer took to social media to cheerfully disprove the hearsay. This new biopic celebrates her decades-long career and delves into her health battles and other personal dramas. A fitting Delta Goodrem, a fellow Aussie who has recorded duets with the “Grease” star, takes the lead role. The movie comes a month before the release of Newton-John’s memoir, “Don’t Stop Believin.’”SUPERSOUL CONVERSATIONS 8 p.m. on OWN.

Jordan, Bradley Cooper and others in this new special.ImageRyan Reynolds in “Deadpool 2.”Credit20th Century FoxDEADPOOL 2 (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as a sardonic antihero in this Marvel sequel. The title character, whose real name is Wade Wilson, assembles a motley team of mutant heroes to save a young mutant (Julian Dennison) from the wrath of the half-bionic Cable (Josh Brolin). The jokes are witty — they will go over your head if you aren’t a DC or Marvel whiz — and the fight scenes are what superhero movies are made of. But the film “takes no real creative risks,” A. O. Scott wrote in his Times review. He adds: “What drives this franchise is the same force that drives so much culture and politics right now: the self-pity of a white man with a relentless need to be the center of attention.”DYNASTIES 9 p.m. on BBC America. This impressive nature documentary series wraps up with what may be its cutest episode: a look at a colony of emperor penguins preparing to raise a new generation on the coast of Antarctica. (A scene where emperor chicks learn how to walk is just delightful.)"

And, on NBC, “Good Girls” returns.What’s on TVLEAVING NEVERLAND 8 p.m. on HBO. In these #MeToo times, will the revival of conversations about Michael Jackson’s alleged pedophilia lead to a reckoning? This documentary by Dan Reed focuses on the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who claim that Jackson sexually abused them for years when they were minors. HBO is showing the four-hour, two-part work over two nights — on Sunday and Monday. The second part will be followed by “Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland,” a separate interview with the two men by Winfrey, which will air at 10 p.m. on HBO and OWN. In a recent article for The New York Times, Wesley Morris called the documentary “long but delicately, patiently done — and so quiet; you can practically hear yourself listening.”ImageRoger Ailes in a scene from “Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes.”CreditWesley Mann/Magnolia PicturesDIVIDE AND CONQUER: THE STORY OF ROGER AILES (2018) 9 p.m. on A&E.  Another complex legacy, that of Roger E. Ailes, the former Fox News executive, is the focus of the filmmaker Alexis Bloom’s work. The film looks at Ailes’s life — and, by extension, the creation of Fox News itself — with interviews with his peers and archival footage chronicling a career that helped create the images of former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. He also profoundly affected the way politics is discussed in America. Ailes’s career ended amid sexual-harassment allegations and played a role in furthering political divisions in the country. “You leave ‘Divide and Conquer’ energized and incensed, and with a grudging admiration for Ailes’s pugnacious instincts,” Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times.ImageFrom left, Retta, Christina Hendricks and Mae Whitman in “Good Girls.”CreditJustin Lubin/NBCGOOD GIRLS 10 p.m. on NBC. Retta, Christina Hendricks and Mae Whitman star in this comedy about three women breaking bad. They got into trouble in Season 1; now their misdeeds might be catching up with them.

Between Todd Douglas Miller’s new documentary on Apollo 11 and the visual effects victory for “First Man” at the Oscars, America’s attempts to send humans to the moon’s surface have been getting an unusual amount of attention. Ron Howard’s space travel drama, which was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1996 (it won two), is “absolutely thrilling,” Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times. It also popularized the phrase “Houston, we have a problem,” a variation on what was actually said (that would be “Houston, we’ve had a problem”). “It’s a small but important change,” Maslin wrote. “One more way that ‘Apollo 13’ unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story.”"

And a new documentary on Richard Pryor is on TV.What’s StreamingARRESTED DEVELOPMENT Stream on Netflix. The first time this sharp, reliably unconventional takedown of upper-crust America wrapped up was in 2006, when Fox canceled it after three seasons. The show’s somewhat unlikely Netflix-powered return in 2013 brought back the wealthy Bluth family — including Michael (Jason Bateman), Lucille (Jessica Walter), Gob (Will Arnett) and George-Michael (Michael Cera) — for a fourth, somewhat more conventional outing that was met with middling reviews from critics. When the first half of the fifth season was released last year, much of the discussion focused not on the show itself but on one of its stars, Jeffrey Tambor, who had been accused of sexual misconduct on the set of the Amazon series “Transparent” and dropped from that series. Now, Netflix is releasing the second half of Season 5. This set of episodes continues plot arcs from the first half of the season, including a missing person investigation and an attempt to build a wall on the Mexican border.ImageZhao Tao in “Mountains May Depart.”CreditKino LorberMOUNTAINS MAY DEPART (2015) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In a review of the Chinese director Jia Zhangke’s new film, “Ash Is Purest White,” for The New York Times, A. O. Scott called him “one the most inventive and engaged directors of the 21st century.” Jia’s previous movie, “Mountains May Depart,” takes place at the very end of the 20th century and during two periods in the 21st. It centers on Tao (Zhao Tao), a worker in a small store in the city of Fenyang. The first part, set in 1999, shows Tao’s relationships with two men, Zhang Jinsheng (Zhang Yi) and Liangzi (Liang Jin Dong). She eventually chooses one. The effects of that decision echo in the film’s two other time frames: 2014 and 2025. Jia’s approach “means that you have to do a certain amount of interpretive work,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. But patience will be rewarded.What’s on TVImageElle Fanning, left, and Bel Powley in “Mary Shelley.”CreditRicardo Vaz Palma/IFC FilmsMARY SHELLEY (2018) 8 p.m. on Showtime.

The movie gives equal weight to the origin story of Shelley herself and the origin story of her novel “Frankenstein.”I AM RICHARD PRYOR 10 p.m. on Paramount Network and 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. Fresh off a recent premiere at South by Southwest, this documentary about Richard Pryor enlists an assortment of voices to paint a portrait of one of the most influential comedians ever to wield a microphone. While its straightforward blend of talking heads and archival clips is more conventional than its subject, the film — built around interviews with Pryor’s wife, Jennifer Lee Pryor, and entertainers like Tiffany Haddish, Howie Mandel and Lily Tomlin — gives an overview of Pryor’s career alongside discussion of the boundaries he pushed and, in some cases, obliterated."

And Hirokazu Kore-eda’s “Shoplifters” hits Hulu.What’s StreamingTHE GOOD FIGHT on CBS All Access. If you’re looking for escapist fantasy, look elsewhere. But if you want an uncommonly topical legal drama with a great title sequence, look here. The previous season of this spinoff of “The Good Wife” went all in with its fictional portrayal of America under President Trump, incorporating into its plot talk of a relationship between the president and a porn star and whispers of Democrat-led impeachment proceedings. The show follows Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a high-powered, white Chicago lawyer at a chiefly African-American firm. The second season ended with a birth. The new season introduces a corrupt, fact-averse lawyer played by Michael Sheen.ImageSakura Ando, Miyu Sasaki and Lily Franky in “Shoplifters.”CreditMagnolia PicturesSHOPLIFTERS (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. “I don’t portray people or make movies where viewers can easily find hope,” the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda told The New York Times. That audacious hopelessness is on full display in this, his most recent feature, which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018. The story revolves around a family of shoplifters who take in a girl (Miyu Sasaki), saving her from abusive parents. It is the first of many morally complex scenes this movie delivers. Our questioning of the family’s morals increases as we get a fuller picture: Midway through the film, the plot “no longer seems to hold much mystery,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. “But it’s at this point where other mysteries take over and where ‘Shoplifters’ deepens, opening up a story about a family with a declaration of moral principles and lifting what had been a good movie into greatness.”WILL SMITH’S BUCKET LIST Stream on Facebook Watch. It’s easy to see why Will Smith signed on to do this web series: The premise is to follow the actor as he goes on brief, somewhat frightening but extremely fun-looking excursions, crossing items off his bucket list. The first two episodes have followed Smith skydiving and sea diving. The latest one has him doing stand-up comedy, which Smith describes as “the hardest thing in entertainment.” Luckily, he has a good coach in Dave Chappelle, who appears here and advises Smith that, in comedy, “confidence is key.” Chappelle introduces the nervous-looking but staggeringly famous Smith to an audience near the end of the episode with the line, “Make some noise for what’s-his-face.”What’s on TVImageJohnny Depp in “Sleepy Hollow.”CreditParamount PicturesSLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) 9 p.m. on Syfy.

Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, Irving’s pencil-thin schoolteacher who is here reimagined as a late-18th-century New York City policeman sent to investigate a string of murders upstate. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the film “enthusiastically bleak.”"

The premise of this dark comedy series can be summed up in a piece of advice given in its first episode: “I should warn you — he might say a few things that are a bit, uhh, brutal.” That line, spoken by Matt (Tom Basden), the head of the local newspaper in a small British town, is said in reference to Tony (Ricky Gervais), an editor of the paper. The show is about Tony; he’s a former nice guy who, after the death of his wife (Kerry Godliman), decides that life would be easier if he started being a jerk to everyone, all the time. It’s a bit like a cynical, reversed version of the positive-thinking Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” with the smile turned upside-down.TIN STAR Stream on Amazon. Backcountry brooding is the lifeblood of this series, which stars Tim Roth as a British expat who gets hired as the police chief of a community in the Rocky Mountains.

The desire for self-discovery is partly what drives Juanita (Alfre Woodard) to grab a map and pick a destination at random in this earnest solo road trip comedy, which is based on a novel by Sheila Williams (Roderick M. Spencer, Woodard’s husband, wrote the screenplay). Juanita is exhausted: by city life, by her three adult kids. So she buys a bus ticket to Montana, kicking off a nomadic trip filled with lighthearted culture clashes and another age-old theme: the balance of romance and autonomy.ROCK ’N’ ROLL HIGH SCHOOL (1979) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This punk rock time capsule turns 40 this year. Directed by Allan Arkush and starring the members of the Ramones, its plot involves a mass record burning and comically wicked school administrators and hall monitors. Its soundtrack has songs by the Ramones (naturally), Devo and Alice Cooper. “Rock ’n’ Roll High School” purports to be little more than summer fun,” John Rockwell wrote in his review for The New York Times. “And, in its zanily unpretentious way, it is certainly that.”What’s on TVImageHarrison Ford in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”CreditLucasfilmRAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) 8 p.m. on Paramount Network.

In his new book, “The War Before the War,” Delbanco argues that disputes over the fates of fugitive slaves did much to accelerate the divisions that led to the Civil War. “The fugitive slave law was an important force in bringing the public and the personal together for more and more Americans, and thereby woke them up to the fact that this was an existential moral problem,” Delbanco says. “How could you have a democratic republic based on the principle of liberty and equality in which millions of human beings were enslaved, some of whom were courageous enough to actually escape and tell you about it?

Why did they do it? “I love to dream big, and I love to find ways to be a bit of an explorer,” Caldwell said an interview with The New York Times. “These days it seems like everything is padded and comes with warning labels.

His “Black Panther,” which he directed and co-wrote, is the first superhero movie to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. And it’s only Coogler’s third feature. “Creed,” his second, resurrected Rocky Balboa for a new generation through a story centered on a young boxer, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the son of Rocky’s enemy-turned-comrade Apollo Creed. An older, weathered Rocky (Sylvester Stallone, of course) takes Adonis under his wing. We also see the blossoming of a relationship between Adonis and a Philadelphia musician (Tessa Thompson) and a scene on those Philadelphia Museum of Art steps Stallone ran up about 40 years earlier. The movie manages to be “self-aware without being cute about it,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He said that Coogler “looks at the Rocky story and the tradition of Hollywood pugilism through a fresh prism” and that the film itself is at once “soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date.”ROY WOOD JR.: NO ONE LOVES YOU 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on “The Daily Show,” tackles the N.F.L. national anthem controversy, the challenges faced by black superheroes and many other subjects in this hourlong comedy special, filmed at the Vic Theater in Chicago. “America is a restaurant that sells equality,” he observes from the stage. “Some of you all had some delicious equality, it was good, you had great service. And some of us need to speak to a manager.”What’s StreamingImageEthan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried in “First Reformed.”CreditA24FIRST REFORMED (2018) Stream on Kanopy; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. “I know that nothing can change, and I know there is no hope.” Paul Schrader’s rhythmic and bleak exploration of faith in the face of depression and environmental ruin stars Ethan Hawke as a tortured Protestant minister who writes lines like the above in his diary. He diligently maintains a small church in upstate New York, even while his health fails, his sense that there is corruption in his own institution grows and his view that the earth itself is deteriorating along with him reaches a boiling point. “It is the portrait of a soul in torment,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, “all the more powerful for being so rigorously conceived and meticulously executed.”ImageMary Bridget Davies in “A Night With Janis Joplin.”CreditJason Niedle/BroadwayHDA NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN on BroadwayHD. Mary Bridget Davies stars in this tribute to the singer, which mixes Joplin’s music with biographical reflections. In his review for The Times, Charles Isherwood called Davies’s impersonation of the singer “positively uncanny,” writing that she sings Joplin’s songs “with a throbbing fervor that is often riveting.”"

The singer-songwriter Thomas Rhett performs a day after the release of his new single, “Look What God Gave Her,” while the sparkly eyed comic John Mulaney hosts. Even with all his acting roles (“Big Mouth,” “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”), Mulaney never strayed too far from his friends at “S.N.L.” He wrote for the show for five years, starting in 2008, but what he really wanted was to be on camera — so much so that he jokingly claimed to have auditioned 44 times. (He eventually landed some appearances.) Now he’s returning to host for the second time; his first gig, in April 2018, featured jokes that made it into his popular Netflix special “Kid Gorgeous at Radio City.”ImageLuke Macfarlane and Meghann Fahy in “Just Add Romance.”CreditDavid Owen Strongman/Crown Media United States LLCJUST ADD ROMANCE (2019) 8 p.m. on Hallmark. Sparks flew when two aspiring chefs, Carly (Meghann Fahy) and Jason (Luke Macfarlane), met at culinary school in New York. Then Jason suddenly left the city to take care of family matters, and Carly didn’t hear a peep. Now, three years later, they cross paths again as contestants on a cooking show in Chicago, and the flirtation is back on. But as they compete for the chance to have their own restaurant, the contest gets in the way of their chemistry.LOVE & MARRIAGE: HUNTSVILLE 10 p.m. on OWN. Three couples try to bring life back to Huntsville, Ala., through a joint real estate venture while navigating their relationships in this reality show. In the first season finale, their enterprise and their personal lives are on shaky ground. As Martell prepares for surgery, Melody warns him that she may not be able to look past his cheating and that things will change after his recovery.

Christian Petzold’s new thriller, “Transit,” about a refugee who flees to France and assumes a dead novelist’s identity, recalls the German director’s slow-burning drama, “Barbara.” Nina Hoss stars as the title character, a doctor banished from a prestigious Berlin institution to a pediatric hospital in the countryside of East Germany in 1980. She takes her new post under the watchful eye of the secret police and yearns to flee to the West, but she is soon torn by her devotion to a desperate patient (Jasna Fritzi Bauer) and a bubbling romance with a young doctor (Ronald Zehrfeld). Manohla Dargis named the film a Critic’s Pick in her review for The New York Times, writing that “while Barbara may just look like she’s letting down her defenses, what you witness is the revelation of a moral imperative that is itself profoundly political.”"

Both of us were raised in conservative Christian households, and we said “I do” at 20. Twelve years and two children later, we’re still in love. But I kept falling in love with other people, too. So now we’re polyamorous. I have a boyfriend. He has a girlfriend. And we share a relationship with another woman. I enjoy it, but what I think I like most is watching other people fall in love with the same boy I fell for years ago. It’s like, “Yeah, you get it, right?” — Jennifer MartinImageFirst love.We Couldn’t Marry, So She Married a Guy As we sat close together at a cafe, I asked her if she was sure. We had been lovers for five years and friends for 10. “My wedding is in two days,” she replied. “I hope you can make it.” Then she said, “Had you been a guy, we would have two kids by now. Also, married.” I smiled, she smiled back, her expression spelling regret. We were two Filipino women without the right to wed. — April CasquejoImageTaken on the way to meet her in our hometown.Our Sisterhood Marathon My sister was waiting for me at the finish of the Chicago Marathon, though she’d crossed it hours before. I ran, demoralized, as the service vehicles bringing up the rear passed me. I ran, unsure how far I had to go, as the mile markers were taken down. My sister never texted: “What’s taking so long?” She waited just past the race archway. We burst into tears when I made it. “I got your medal,” she said, slipping it over my head. The photographers were already gone. — Grace HussarImageBefore the race, lining up at the start. I'm on the left.She Shushed the Audience for MeIt was during a lull in my writing life, six months of no publications and constant moping, when she said, “Look, I don’t want to hear about this writing stuff anymore until you can make a living at it, O.K.? I just don’t.” She wanted substance, a child, maybe a ring. Yet she still accompanied me to every reading at every dive bar, independent bookstore and trendy Brooklyn art space. And when I delayed a club’s burlesque night with my 18-page opus, there she was, telling the audience to shut their traps, one nattering hipster at a time. — J.B.

Two days later, I received an email from a dating service for those over 50. The subject line asked, “Are you ready to try love again?” I burst out laughing. It must be a coincidence. Or are all the computers trading information? Maybe the consensus on the internet is that after 48 hours, it’s time to move on. When I stopped laughing, I thought, “I’ve got to tell Tom. He’ll think it’s hilarious.” Oh. I do that a lot these days. — Nora RaumImageTom on the day he retired from the Associated Press.More Tiny Love StoriesTiny Love Stories: ‘20 Years in the Friend Zone’March 26, 2019Tiny Love Stories: ‘Relationships Are Like Shoes’March 19, 2019See more Tiny Love Stories at nytimes.com/modernlove.Submit yours at nytimes.com/tinylovestories.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

And the crime series “White Dragon” is available to stream on Amazon.What’s on TVHALE COUNTY THIS MORNING, THIS EVENING (2018) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); rent on iTunes. This Oscar-nominated debut feature by RaMell Ross was made out of 1,300 hours of footage filmed over five years. It documents the lives of two young black men, Daniel Collins and Quincy Bryant, in Hale County, Ala., with an innovative cinematic approach. The critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times named it one of the best movies of 2018, and wrote that Ross “glimpses arresting, at times almost hallucinatory beauty in the rural Alabama landscape, and finds nuances of emotion that grow in intensity over 75 heady minutes.”AMERICAN DAD! 10 p.m. on TBS. After a long break, Season 13 returns with a new episode in which Francine (voiced by Wendy Schaal) bulks up to become a bodybuilder after her family calls her a quitter.ImageSteve Rubell, left, and Ian Schrager, in “Studio 54.”CreditPhotofest, via Zeitgeist FilmsSTUDIO 54 (2018) 10 p.m. on A&E. Andy Warhol once said Studio 54 was “a dictatorship at the door and a democracy on the dance floor.” Michael Jackson described that club as the place “where you come when you want to escape.” That was in Studio 54’s heyday in the late 1970s, when the New York hot spot attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Mick Jagger and drew the ire of those who could not make it past the velvet ropes. Its wild ride ended, though, after 33 months when its founders, Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, were sentenced to prison for tax evasion. In this documentary by Matt Tyrnauer, Schrager recounts the details behind the rise and fall of his notorious club — a tale that he described in an interview with The Times as an “operatic, tragic story of the years ending the sexual revolution.” Another documentary by Tyrnauer,  ‘SCOTTY AND THE SECRET HISTORY OF HOLLYWOOD,’  about a former Marine who was an escort to closeted gay movie stars during Hollywood’s golden age, leads in at 9 p.m. on Starz.What’s StreamingImageJohn Simm, left, and Anthony Wong in “White Dragon.”CreditAmazon StudiosWHITE DRAGON stream on Amazon.

There he discovers disturbing revelations that lead him to David (Anthony Wong), an ex-cop who was surprisingly close to Jonah’s wife and who joins Jonah in his search for answers. “The show does its job as gritty tourist-noir,” Mike Hale writes in his review for The Times. But, he adds, “It’s never quite as fun or romantic as it should be, and the characters’ words and actions tend to run counter to common sense.”FLAVORFUL ORIGINS stream on Netflix.

And the Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo” is available to rent online.What’s on TVWHISKEY CAVALIER 10 p.m. on ABC. More screwball than “Thunderball,” this comedic spy series pairs an emotional, fresh-off-a-breakup F.B.I. agent (Scott Foley) with a by-any-means-necessary C.I.A. operative (Lauren Cohan) in a joint task force. Cue a dance of wit, sexual tension and clandestine assignments foiled by pesky human emotions. (“Agent, do not empathize” is an order given at one point, via a concealed earpiece.) The show finds humor and humanity in serious business. That’s a feature it shares with “Scrubs,” the comedy-drama series created by Bill Lawrence (an executive producer of this show), which also featured Foley. In his review of the beginning of the first season of “Whiskey” for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that it “looks giddily enjoyable.”ALIEN NEWS DESK 11 p.m. on Syfy. If all you can think about when you watch the “Weekend Update” segment on “Saturday Night Live” is “needs more aliens,” this might be the show for you. Will Forte and Heidi Gardner voice a pair of extraterrestrial beings breaking down Earth’s news in this new animated show, led by the “Weekend Update” writer Dennis McNicholas. The anchors refer to an Academy Award as an “arrogance enhancement totem” and our very planet as a “backwater outpost.” So the show promises to stand out in the ever more crowded field of late-night programming through otherworldly skepticism and, well, by being hosted by a pair of cartoon aliens.What’s StreamingImageAlex Honnold in “Free Solo.”CreditJimmy Chin/National GeographicFREE SOLO (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Acrophobic audiences who nevertheless want to see the winner of this year’s Oscar for best documentary feature can take comfort in this: Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi’s portrait of the free climber Alex Honnold is as much a character study as a gravity-testing climb-along. The film follows Honnold as he prepares a free solo climb — a ropeless ascent — up El Capitan in Yosemite. But it’s also a story of what drove Honnold to pursue what is often a fatal sport. (The answer involves, in no small part, his childhood.) Chin and Vasarhelyi have “a knack for exposing, without exploiting, a little of the man beneath the apparent madness,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. She called the film “an engaging study of a perfect match between passion and personality.”ImageDavid Farrier in “Tickled.”CreditMagnolia PicturesTICKLED (2016) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. David Farrier and Dylan Reeve’s documentary on the adult tickling world won’t, in the end, leave you laughing — but it is a fascinating, mysterious dive into a subculture. What begins as the fulfillment of the directors’ curiosity morphs into something darker when they begin receiving legal threats for their investigations. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the documentary “terrifically entertaining.” The less you know going in, the better. It’s that kind of story."

In an interview with The New York Times, Plaza said she was hoping for a grand entrance, but reality may be a tad less flashy: “I’m just going to wash up on shore from the water, in rags.” She succeeds the irreverent comics John Mulaney and Nick Kroll, who, in their opening monologue at last year’s ceremony, reflected on the news surrounding the #MeToo movement.

It follows Julien (Amalric) and Esther (Stéphanie Cléau), former schoolmates who, when they’re older and married, wind up in an impassioned affair. Their romance feels wicked from the start, but once Julien gets arrested, their lives intertwine in dark, unexpected ways.

This uplifting documentary carries the suspense and drama of reality-TV competitions, but it also offers a healthy dose of squeal-worthy shots. The contestants in question are five puppies training to become guide dogs for the blind over the course of 20 months. With lives at stake, the matter is not taken lightly: Many pups don’t make the cut, and rivalries flare up among the human “puppy raisers.” Whether or not the dogs pass the tests, the tenacity of all involved is simply admirable. “It’s startling, even inspiring, to see how many humans it takes to condition a fully successful dog,” the film critic Ben Kenigsberg wrote in The New York Times. “Every single canine on screen deserves plenty of head-pats and naps in the shade.”BORDERTOWN on Netflix.

(Krumping has since been seen in music videos and in an episode of “Community.”) Early on, the documentary notes that none of the footage has been sped up — the dancers really do pump their chests and flail their arms at frenetic paces. By the end, it captures a momentous battle and conveys that the dances were born despite, or because of, surrounding poverty and gang violence.What’s on TVImageAubrey Peeples, left, and Kellie Martin in “Death of a Cheerleader.”CreditLifetimeDEATH OF A CHEERLEADER (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime.

The blow drives a vengeful Bridget over the edge, but no one in her neighborhood suspects she is behind Kelly’s demise. Kellie Martin, who starred in the original alongside Tori Spelling, returns in the role of an F.B.I. agent. The 1994 movie is available to rent or stream on Amazon."

Even though I dumped him for the visiting art professor, he dropped everything to drive me home when my 45-year-old mother lay dying of alcoholism.

Nobody will know it but you. There was pain in my relationship with my boyfriend of eight years, but I had ignored it. I finally understood the true meaning of my mother’s saying when he cheated on me. I don’t hate him or the other woman anymore.

She plays Judy, a middle-aged transgender woman who falls for a much younger man, Leo (Harry Hepple). The first season focuses on the reaction of Leo’s family to his new relationship, but when that story line ended there was not much left to work with: The show got the ax after just two seasons.THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.

She told me I made her sweat, paying attention to her like she was a first-class passenger, but I said it was just the polyester uniform. On our layover, we drank wine and ate Thai food. I spent the night at her house instead of my airport hotel room. Seven years later, we married. Now, when we find ourselves on the same flight, we sometimes pretend we are strangers meeting for the first time, just to keep things fresh.

Three months later, he is deported, his asylum case lost. — Kristina Karin ShullImageMy husband, Andi.A Cozy, Crowded BedMy friend June said, “Get rid of the gray. Everyone lies about their age.” I kept the gray but pretended I was 71, my younger sister’s age. My other friend, Alice, said, “Don’t waste your time with these dating sites.” Online, not much activity. I wrote to some men; some men wrote to me. Then a man, a professor my age, married 44 years until his wife died, asked me out. I, also a professor, widowed after 36 years, said O.K. to coffee. Turns out he lives two blocks away. Now, the bed is crowded: his wife, my husband, us. It’s kind of cozy. — Nan Bauer-MaglinImageOur bed.Best Investment Ever I once purchased a penny with a heart cut into it at a New Jersey rest stop.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.I’m a fan of ranked-choice voting. I think it’s a fairer way to decide elections than the more common method, in which each person can vote for only a first choice. The 2000 presidential election highlighted the problem with this first-choice system. That year, more Floridians preferred Al Gore to George W. Bush. But Bush won, because some of the people who preferred Gore to Bush voted for Ralph Nader as their first choice. In ranked-choice voting, people can list multiple candidates, in order of preference. If your first choice isn’t among the top two vote-getters, your later choices start to matter. And the method has been catching on in recent years. Australia, Britain, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand all use it for some elections. The state of Maine has also started using it, and a congressional race last year turned on voters’ second choices. Now there is another way in which ranked choice could be useful: Solving the Brexit mess.Brexit is at a standstill because none of the options has the support of a majority of Parliament (or, it seems, of the British people). Yesterday, Parliament voted on eight different proposals under which Britain could leave the European Union. None got a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May has even offered to resign if Parliament passes her plan, knowing that would appeal to many members of Parliament. In previous votes, the May plan hasn’t come close to passing.So some observers have begun calling for a ranked-choice solution. In effect, it would winnow down the options to the two most popular and then force Parliament to choose between them. “The great virtue of this voting system,” Partha Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, writes in The Financial Times, “is that it results in an outcome that is truly the majority winner.” Part of the idea, as Ian Dunt, the editor of politics.co.uk, has written, is “creating a process where tolerable compromises can be found.”Notably, one of the only proposals that came closest to passing yesterday was a kind of meta option, calling for the British people to get an up-or-down vote on any plan Parliament ultimately passed. It’s a sign of how far Parliament remains from agreeing on the substance of Brexit.I’ll confess to being torn about my hopes here. On the one hand, I think ranked-choice voting is a fair way for Parliament to find the most acceptable version of Brexit. On the other, I wouldn’t mind if Parliament were to find any acceptable version and then put the entire matter before the British public for a re-vote.Related: On the latest episode of “The Argument” podcast, Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I talk about how to replace the Electoral College, and one option is a national popular vote with ranked choice. We also debate the meaning of the Mueller investigation — and who should be feeling vindicated by it.College diversity, on filmFor anyone interested in economic diversity in higher education — as I am — I recommend a new film that follows three high school students in Brooklyn as they try to navigate the application process. It’s called “Personal Statement” and is directed by Juliane Dressner. It’s available for renting on Amazon or iTunes. The film feels particularly timely in the wake of the college admissions scandal. The experiences of the three students in “Personal Statement” are much closer to the American norm than the elite world of, say, the Georgetown tennis team.One of the film’s students, Enoch Jemmott, who’s now a senior at Queens College, has an Op-Ed in The Times this morning. In it, he describes the hurdles that lower-income students face, from the lack of a single college counselor at many high schools to the byzantine misery of financial aid forms.If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

What’s on TVAMERICAN SOUL 9 p.m. on BET. Set in 1970s Los Angeles against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, this new drama series chronicles the making of the first national program of its kind: “Soul Train,” a response to “American Bandstand” written, produced and owned by black people. Sinqua Walls (“Power”) portrays Don Cornelius, the creator and host of the show, alongside the actors Kelly Price and Jason Dirden. Among the guest stars are Wayne Brady, Bobby Brown and some former members of Destiny’s Child, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. “American Soul” debuts with two back-to-back episodes in which Don goes out of his way to secure a star performer who will take his project to the next level. In an interview with The New York Times, Rowland — who appeared on the show in 1998 — talked about her role as Gladys Knight and what the series meant to her growing up. “‘Soul Train’ was one of my first memories of watching all these different beautiful black people dancing and having a good time,” she said.ImagePresident Trump, at his State of the Union address on Jan. 30, 2018.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesSTATE OF THE UNION 9 p.m. on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and various cable news stations. The 2019 State of the Union address has finally arrived. The annual tradition was delayed when Speaker Nancy Pelosi told President Trump that she would not host him in the House until the government reopened, leading to a tit-for-tat that was resolved last week, after the 35-day government shutdown ended. While talks surrounding a border wall have dominated the news out of Washington lately, Trump is expected to discuss several other topics and make a call for bipartisanship. The speech will be followed by the Democrats’ official response, to be delivered by Stacey Abrams.What’s StreamingImageRay Romano in “Right Here, Around the Corner.”CreditNetflixRAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER (2019) on Netflix.

Judging from his material, the actor with the instantly recognizable nasal voice is not unlike his character in “Everybody Loves Raymond”: a man who never feels like he is doing enough to please his wife. Romano currently stars in Epix’s television adaptation of “Get Shorty,” and will make a second Netflix appearance when the drama “Paddleton” debuts on Feb. 22.THELMA & LOUISE (1991) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.

For Thelma (Davis), the vacation is a much-needed getaway from her controlling husband (Christopher McDonald) that turns into a wild escape after an altercation at a bar parking lot. The movie balances its wild adventures and violence with a profound, feminist message that seems relevant now more than ever."

During the past 10 years, ESPN’s “30 for 30” series has covered stories about the world’s most intriguing athletes and sports figures, like O. J. Simpson, Andrés Escobar and Bo Jackson. Jackson appears in this latest installment, which focuses on another two-sport athlete, Deion Sanders, and the 24 hours in 1992 when he attempted to play professional baseball, for the Braves, and football, for the Falcons. The documentary, narrated by the rapper Ludacris, features interviews with former Braves and Falcons players, coaches and sportscasters.TRUCK NIGHT IN AMERICA 10 p.m. on History. At a time when you can find a TV show that focuses on just about any niche topic — pimple-popping, extreme couponing, making cakes poorly — it’s not surprising that there would be one completely devoted to large, customized trucks. The new season of this competition series pits five drivers against one another in monster-truck-rally-style challenges, like climbing mounds of crushed cars or trudging through swamps. The two best drivers will compete to win $10,000, taking their rigs through an obstacle course called the Green Hell.What’s StreamingImageFrom left, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi and John Goodman in “The Big Lebowski.”CreditUniversal StudiosTHE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) on Netflix, Crackle, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, iTunes and Vudu.

And by Monday, fans of “The Big Lebowski” got the rest of the footage in the form of a short Super Bowl ad for Stella Artois, featuring the Dude alongside Carrie Bradshaw turning down their usual drinks of choice for the Stellas.

Six years ago, The Wall Street Journal profiled a group of adult men in their 40s who, in the past two decades, had kept up a long-running game of tag since high school, flying around the country, hiding in bushes and popping out of car trunks to avoid being “it” for an entire year. By 2018, the incredible true antics had inspired a feature film, starring Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Hannibal Buress, Jeremy Renner and Jake Johnson. And while the game and its players might seem juvenile, the film also touches on the anxiety that can accompany aging. In his review, The New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote, “The story does wander into a few dark corners of middle age: romantic disappointment; addiction and recovery; the possibility of illness and the inevitability of death.”"

In an interview with “Independent Lens,” the director Chico Colvard said that he grew up “unconsciously consuming a steady diet” of racist black memorabilia. While the objects he mentions — such as mechanical banks or kitchenware — were created years ago, the tropes they perpetuated live on: Last month, a video of white students at a New York private school in blackface went viral, and old photos of a Florida state official in blackface were resurfaced by a local paper. In this documentary, Colvard explores where those objects and images stand in today’s society. His research takes him to a Chinese factory that manufactures racist figurines; a flea market in North Carolina where vendors sell Confederate collectibles; and a neighborhood in Brooklyn where a black artist tries to reclaim minstrel-show themes.ImageFrom left, Liza Snyder, Kevin Nealon and Matt LeBlanc in “Man With a Plan.”CreditSonja Flemming/CBSMAN WITH A PLAN 8:30 p.m. on CBS.

Smith became the United States poet laureate in 2017, she has been hosting readings big and small in all corners of the country.Now she is spreading poetry through the air waves.Starting Jan. 14, her podcast, “The Slowdown,” will be broadcast on public radio stations in seven cities, including San Francisco, Honolulu and Charleston, W. Va.Produced by American Public Media with funding by the Poetry Foundation and support from the Library of Congress, “The Slowdown” debuted as a five-minute weekday podcast in late November. It’s available to stream on iTunes, Google Podcasts and other platforms. In each episode, Ms. Smith introduces, and then reads, a poem of her choosing.The idea for the podcast arose last year while she was visiting towns as part of a reading series called “American Conversations: Celebrating Poems in Rural Communities.”She started to feel guilty, she said, that the experience of striking up a dialogue about poetry with complete strangers was hers alone.“Broadcast seemed like a way of sharing that more widely,” Ms. Smith said.“The Slowdown” is “a conversation between the listener and whatever poem is up for the day,” she added.Ms. Smith was inspired, she said, by her “21st Century worry” of living in an age of technology that favors impatience and indulgence over vulnerability and curiosity.“I thought ‘The Slowdown’ can be a tiny little daily antidote to that,” she said. “It can say, ‘Can we just get quiet for a minute? Can we just listen to actual words that are employed with a great deal of focus and urgency?’”Ms. Smith highlights works by American poets that she believes can stand on their own and that can be accessible aurally. Having a variety of voices has come naturally.Some poets, she has long admired. Others are newer to her. “It just seems like the most exciting poetry that’s being written right now is coming from every direction,” she said.Most of the poets she features on her podcast are contemporary — upcoming episodes feature Victoria Chang, Kamilah Aisha Moon and Jacob Saenz, to name a few — but listeners may also hear classics like Shakespeare or George Herbert.Robert Casper, the head of the Poetry and Literary Center at the Library of Congress, said he looks forward to seeing not only what Ms. Smith “will bring to the broadcast of each of those poems, but how different people across the country will interpret those poems differently.”Ms. Smith’s final event as poet laureate will be a gathering moderated by Jennifer Benka, the executive director of the Academy of American Poets, where five state and regional poets laureate will reflect on their positions. Once her term comes to an end in April, Ms. Smith said, she will most likely want to write about what she has learned in the last two years.“There’s a lot that I haven’t brought into language yet,” she said."

Over three seasons Syfy’s fantasy show about students at a school for magic has differentiated itself from, you know, that other series you probably just thought of, through a potent mixture of killings, depression and magic-augmented sex. The magical youngish adults here, adapted from novels by Lev Grossman, use words like “vibe” and phrases like “pro tip”; the story centers on a graduate student, Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph), and some other magic students who struggle with both magical malefactors and mental health. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the series “manages to be more engaging and credible than the usual basic-cable genre drama,” noting that it’s “different enough in its details that from moment to moment you can forget how derivative it is.” The fourth season, debuting Wednesday night, involves rebellion and memory loss.DROP THE MIC 10 p.m. on TNT.

Maggie Mulubwa stars as Shula, an orphan who, after arriving in a Zambian village, is accused of being a witch. Her refusal to confirm or deny the accusation matters little; she’s grouped with the town’s other “witches” and forced to become an unpaid laborer and, at times, a tourist attraction. “The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula’s inability to escape exploitation,” Ben Kenigsberg wrote in The Times. “But the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality.”"

Fans who have only seen high school productions (or middle school, or elementary school, or all three) of Jonathan Larson’s 1996 musical riff on “La Bohème” have at least one major reason be excited about this live television adaptation: Michael Greif, who directed the original production at the New York Theater Workshop and a more recent Off Broadway production, is working with Alex Rudzinski (who in recent years directed “Grease: Live!” and John Legend as Jesus in “Jesus Christ Superstar” live in concert) to bring the musical to TV. That’s about the most qualified team one could hope for, and the cast is delightfully varied: Vanessa Hudgens (of “High School Musical” and “Grease: Live!”), the pop singer Tinashe, Brandon Victor Dixon (Leslie Odom Jr.’s replacement as Aaron Burr in “Hamilton”) and Valentina (“RuPaul’s Drag Race”) are all featured. The story concerns a group of New York artists living in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic — though it’s not all gloomy. “Puccini’s ravishingly melancholy work seemed, like many operas of its time, to romance death,” Ben Brantley wrote in his 1996 review for The New York Times. “Mr. Larson’s spirited score and lyrics defy it.”25TH ANNUAL SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS 8 p.m. on TBS and TNT.

In 2014, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, took their friend Payton Leutner into the Wisconsin woods and stabbed her 19 times. They said they did it to appease Slender Man, a shadowy, mythical character that has become a legend since taking shape in an online forum nearly a decade ago. (Leutner managed to crawl away and eventually recovered. Geyser, who wielded the knife, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years in a psychiatric hospital.) This new documentary special charts the events leading up to the crime through interviews with detectives, lawyers and relatives of the teenagers. The case also receives the documentary treatment in the 2016 HBO film “Beware the Slenderman.” (For those more interested in a fictional version, the 2018 horror flick “Slender Man” is available for rental on Amazon, Google Play or YouTube.)KNIGHT SQUAD 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon.

That epiphany gets him fired, so he starts his own agency with the help of Dorothy (Renée Zellweger), a former co-worker, and manages to cling to one client, Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a flamboyant, Oscar-winning performance), a football player who is at once admirable and unbearable (“Show me the money!”)."

I was coming from a progressive political rally. She was coming from a work happy hour. Tipsy, she moaned longingly at my McFlurry. I asked if she wanted some. She did. We flirted as the passenger in the front seat was dropped off. She asked the driver if she should get out with me. The driver said we lived near each other. We kissed to make sure it was worth it. It was. Eight months later, we can’t get Uber to sponsor our love. Uber? McDonalds? Are you there? Let’s synergize. — Sam BonarImageA face mask night, of course!“Come Back, Come Back, Come Back”My brother going off to war in Afghanistan — a modern Odysseus — unexpectedly transformed me into Penelope. Just as Penelope wove a never-ending shroud while she waited for her soldier to come home, I developed a new and sudden obsession with knitting, winding yarn around needles to make him an endless stream of impractical and unwanted accessories — scarves, gloves, even a camouflage hat (with pom-poms). Powerless to protect him, I turned the rows of stitches into my rosary: “Come back, come back, come back.” Once he was home I put down my needles, permanently. — Kate SturlaImageThe camouflage hat I knitted for my brother.She Wore My ThongIt was my first wedding with her as my plus-one, and we were first on the dance floor. When the D.J. played “Low” by Flo Rida, I dropped it so low that I split my pants. We went to the women’s bathroom to survey the damage. It was pretty bad. She could see my whole butt, especially when I tried out some dance moves. She’d never worn a thong before, but the situation was dire. So we swapped. I pulled on her full-coverage underwear, she slid on my thong, and we headed back out to dance. — Jessica HackelImageAt the wedding, before the split pants. I'm on the left, and Emma is on the right.My Main Men as MealsMy first boyfriend, Howie, was matzo ball soup: warm and homey, wonderful on a cold, wintry day, but not a lot of sex appeal. My previously married ex-husband, John, was leftover Chinese food: so compelling in the refrigerator, but you were always sorry after you ate it. Vinnie, pizza-maker and “transition man,” was a banquet verging on bacchanal: destined to create heartburn but impossible to stop eating. My now and hopefully forever man, Charles, is bran flakes sprinkled with a few Lucky Charms: He keeps me regular and, on most days, is magically delicious. — Jill LiptonImageBonding over balanced breakfasts in New York City.First the Ugly, Then the BeautyWe met on an app. I chose my favorite brewery for our first date. When he ordered only water to drink while I enjoyed a few beers, I prodded. With neither hesitation nor shame, he laid out his demons: four years in recovery from heroin and alcohol addiction. Then I laid out mine: 10 years recovering from eating disorders. Within 15 minutes, we knew all of each other’s ugly parts. We’ve spent the rest of our time together discovering the beautiful ones. — Ally PetrillaImageUs at Diablo Lake in Washington State.More Tiny Love StoriesTiny Love Stories: ‘Feeling Hopeless About Marriage.

And Netflix tests interactive storytelling with “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.”What’s StreamingSUPPORT THE GIRLS (2018) on Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. Regina Hall plays the manager of a Hooters-esque Texas restaurant in Andrew Bujalski’s subtly directed comedy, whose fans include The New York Times’s co-chief film critics and Barack Obama, who included it in a list of his favorite movies of 2018. It follows Lisa (Hall), the headstrong leader of an ensemble of tight-knit waitresses. The story takes place mostly during a single workday, one that’s full of trials, tribulations and churlish patrons. Bujalski “likes to foreground people and places that other moviemakers ignore or use as atmosphere,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “He sees these women, and invites you to see them, too.”ImageFionn Whitehead in “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.”CreditNetflixBLACK MIRROR: BANDERSNATCH (2018) on Netflix. Technological skepticism meets “Choose Your Own Adventure” in this latest installment of Charlie Brooker’s extremely popular sci-fi anthology series, which comes in the form of a full-length movie. How full-length it is depends on the viewer: In what has been seen as a move by Netflix to test interest in gamified television storytelling, “Bandersnatch” allows watchers to make choices that affect what happens next in the story, and ultimately the ending. The length varies depending on what choices the viewer makes. But the story’s premise is always the same: It’s the mid-1980s, and a young, stressed-out English programmer (played by Fionn Whitehead) is adapting a book into a video game.COMEDIANS OF THE WORLD on Netflix. This multilingual sampler plate of international stand-up comedy features comics from around the world delivering half-hour sets.

In small-town Arkansas, two boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), explore an island on the Mississippi River and make two discoveries: a boat wedged in a tree and a sun-kissed runaway who’s been living in it. That man, Mud (Matthew McConaughey), comes to rely on the boys as they supply him with food. He in turn supplies them with colorful stories in this coming-of-age drama from the director Jeff Nichols. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote: “Mr. Nichols’s screenplay is perhaps a little too heavily plotted, especially toward the end, when everything comes together neatly and noisily, but he more than compensates with graceful rhythm, an unfussy eye for natural beauty and a sure sense of character and place.”What’s on TVBEN-HUR (1959) 8 p.m. on TCM.

That wasn’t enough for my mother, who, while still in Venezuela with my father, fell sick, dropping to 95 pounds. We thought it was gastrointestinal, but it was fear and sadness: Would we ever be together again? When my sister’s family joined my brother’s in Maui, something sparked. Instant joy from this picture fueled her recovery. — Jesus YajureImageMy brother's family and sister's family reuniting in Maui airport.‘We Won’t Finish This Story Together’The 19-year age difference appalled my mother: “It will kill your father!” Yet my father approved. “We don’t always understand what Gayle does,” he said, smiling, at my wedding. “But it always works out.” In time, nobody noticed the age gap — we certainly didn’t. But 34 years on, it’s gaping again. We know we won’t finish this story together. I creak a little; he creaks more. Yet we’re still riding the same wave of passion that we always have: argument, travel, art, a shared table. We will crash with happiness; we refuse to end with a whimper. — Gayle AustenImageIn a restaurant in Barcelona.Enough Time to Tee OffWe thought we heard a flicker of a heartbeat, but it was gone now. Our doctor stared at the screen for an eternity before advising us to evacuate the now nonviable pregnancy. We were to come back in three hours. What to do with the last three hours of my pregnancy? My husband took me to the nearby driving range. With each swing, we hit out our frustration and pain. At 2 p.m. my husband held my hand and stroked my hair as our baby left my body. I had never felt more loved by him than in that moment. — Amanda LockwoodImageA picture from the driving range that day.Apart but Still TogetherAfter paying $2.99 for Tinder Plus, I sat on my couch in Vermont, dropped the little red pin in Seoul and swiped right. So did Jun Hee. Our first FaceTime conversation lasted five hours. God, family, gayness, politics, children — we talked about it all. Not a typical conversation between two Korean men. When I landed in Incheon, he was waiting at the airport. A perfect summer together, our first relationship.

I was trying to get into his head to discourage him from applying for the space, but he thought I was flirting. Fifteen minutes later, when I turned in my application, the landlord thought we were looking for an apartment together. “No, we just met!” I said. “I don't know this guy.” “That's too bad,” she replied. ”You’d make a great couple.” I got the apartment; he got my number.

Today it is guarded as a mesmerizing tropical ecosystem, but more than a century ago entrepreneurs and politicians saw it as a useless swamp ripe for development.

When this female-driven spinoff of the “Ocean’s” trilogy hit theaters, most critics agreed that the A-list ensemble cast gave the movie its oomph, but that it should have stayed in the hands of the original “Ocean’s” director, Steven Soderbergh. Here, Gary Ross delivers a lukewarm caper starring Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the equally criminal sister of Danny Ocean. Fresh out of prison, Debbie hatches a monumental heist: snatching a $150 million dollar Cartier necklace off the neck of an actress (Anne Hathaway) during the annual Met Gala. Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling and Sarah Paulson — to name a few — play her co-conspirators. In her review, Manohla Dargis said a subplot involving guy troubles proves “needless.” She adds: “The movie sounds and narratively unwinds like the previous installments, but without the same easy snap or visual allure.”PLANET EARTH 6 a.m. on BBC America.

Back in Sydney, I told my 85-year-old grandmother I wanted to send him photos of native birds. Weeks later, I received a voice mail message from her, saying, “I took my first photo! It’s a cockatoo for you to send to that boy you like in New York.” It was blurry, and his response wasn’t game-changing, but I’ll always remember that my grandmother learned how to use an iPhone just so she could help me impress a bloke overseas.

Born and raised in Sydney’s inner city, I had no dust on my boots or dirt under my nails. “You drive a Ute?” her grandfather asked me, referring to a utility vehicle. “Absolutely,” I lied. When I crashed through the back of their garage, I figured we were over. At least it’ll make a good story: “I used to date this girl until her grandfather killed me.” He ran over, unleashing an impressive torrent of curse words. Then I saw her doubled over laughing and knew everything would be OK. — Thomas MitchellImageTogether at her family farm.The Dress I Can’t Throw AwayWhen I was 15, I bought a white dress at a store called “Tree of Life.” I told my best friend that one day I would marry her in it. We laughed, which hurt me, though I couldn’t figure out why. Eventually, I worked it out and told her the truth: None of it had ever been a joke. In the same sentence, she told me she loved me but we could never happen — girls didn’t marry other girls. In 2017, when marriage equality passed in Australia, she was the first person I thought of, my first great love. I’ve kept the white dress.

It was the first purchase I’d made for my college-bound self the summer after my mother’s suicide. I had coped with her death with a controlled self-sufficiency. Watching that piece of plastic fly out of Steve’s hands and crack on the floor, I felt my fragile facade of security breaking too. But amid my tears, Steve only wanted to understand why a $12 piece of kitchenware was connected to my pain. He isn’t scared to peek into the darkest layers of my life. Steve sees me as my full self. — Elizabeth JonesImageFirst day in our new apartment.“Who Are You Sleeping With?”My husband is Thai by birth and I’m American. He is not demonstrative. That’s part cultural and part who he is. When we were first married I needed to hear the words, but I got used to looking for other signs of his love, such as him cooking my favorite Thai dishes. Twenty years married, we were sitting at a sushi bar waiting for our food when he turned to me and said, “I love you.” Shocked, I said, “Who are you sleeping with?” This November we’ll be married 50 years. I think he loves me. — Lee ChinalaiImageStirring coffee in Santa Fe, N.M.A Small Hand in MineAt first, she was the little face I saw in pictures when her mother and I began dating. When the time was right, she was the tiny body standing cautiously in the corner of the living room — wondering, waiting. Before long, she was the small hand in mine as we crossed the street, the smile to prove she had brushed her teeth and the curious voice whispering until we fell asleep. It began to feel as if she were mine. Now, six months after the split with her mother, I realize she was not mine. But I loved her. — Nicole DeMouthImageAn impromptu stop to watch the sunset and say hello to the cows in Melrose, N.Y.“Just” a Cop After dating too many fellow lawyers, men unduly concerned about whether I was smarter than them (yes), made more money (rude) or was funnier (duh!), I wondered about sperm donors. Then I met Bert. The exes would have called him “just” a cop. Hellishly good-looking, irrevocably calm and a quiet observer who missed nothing, he was smarter but didn’t need anyone to know it.

When we last saw the Roses, they seemed to be actually liking Schitt’s Creek, the small town that the formerly wealthy family landed in after being defrauded by their business manager. They were still living in adjoining rooms at the Rosebud Motel, which the patriarch, Johnny, now co-owns with Stevie, and visiting Twyla at the Café Tropical, but over all, things were looking up. David and Alexis found love, and Moira even seems to have gotten her acting career somewhat back on track. On Wednesday, the comedy, created by the father-and-son team Eugene and Dan Levy, returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, reuniting fans with an uncharacteristically happy Rose clan.EQUUS: STORY OF THE HORSE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dogs might be considered man’s best friend, but horses and humans have a long and storied history.

Described by YouTube as an “action comedy and a punk-rock teen romance,” this original series follows 16-year-old Wayne (Mark McKenna) as he travels from Boston to Florida on a dirt bike to retrieve a stolen 1978 Trans Am his ailing father wanted to leave him after his death. But before he sets off, he grabs a pair of nunchucks and his new crush, Del (Ciara Bravo), whose meathead brothers eventually come looking for them.ImageAsa Butterfield and Gillian Anderson in “Sex Education.”CreditSam Taylor/NetflixSEX EDUCATION on Netflix. If you’re in the mood for more teenage angst, check out this new comedy starring Gillian Anderson and Asa Butterfield as a very open sex therapist and her teenage son, Otis, who discovers he has a surprising talent for helping his peers navigate the awkward obstacles that come with dating and having sex for the first time. With help from his best friend, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), who’s gay, and his crush, Maeve (Emma Mackey), Otis turns his skill into a side hustle, charging sexually frustrated “clients” for his guidance, despite having his own set of intimate issues. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik named the show a Critic’s Pick, and called it “a little bit ‘Masters of Sex,’ a little bit ‘Doogie Howser, XXX.’ But it blooms, over eight episodes, into a smart, sensitive look at teens finding their place and figuring out the owner’s manuals for their bodies.”AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play.

An almost complete disregard for anyone besides myself. A fully intact perineum. Steadfast opinions on child rearing. A self-regulating internal body temperature. A vague disdain for that mother who would “work from home” on Fridays even though our office did not have an established work-from-home-on-Fridays policy. An unwavering reverence for that old chestnut of the capitalist patriarchy, “I can have it all!” The slightest idea of who I am, or who I will become.

In her mind he was my Uncle Joe, her husband who died 30 years before. Shottsy would expect my aunt’s visits, lying under his covers in anticipation. One night Aunt Frieda surprised him.

When I found the love of my life, he immediately signed up for this journey. We knew we would do everything we could to care for my mother and, eventually, we would watch her die. For us, love isn’t chocolates and date nights and expensive trips. Love is my husband rubbing my mother’s feet after her bath, making her laugh as he pretends she is kicking him in the stomach, helping her take her medicine and holding me after she was gone. — Jessica McLeanImageMy husband and my mother on her 56th birthday.“A Breakfast Betrayed”We had been married just a few weeks. I used up the last of the milk one morning and left for work while my husband was still in the shower. I returned that evening to find an art installation on the table, labeled in neat handwriting on a folded-over notecard: “A Breakfast Betrayed. 1993. Wheat on ceramic.” Next to it was the bowl of cereal my husband had poured for himself — sitting milkless. For more than 25 years, we have continued to treat domestic annoyances with humor.

I did not trust men, especially in the mostly female space I had co-founded, which was keeping me going after a trying divorce. But Hal was genuine and kind to everyone, and made no demands. He went from fan to volunteer to friend to lover to guy who dropped his entire life to drive me to Missouri to care for my dying mother. I realized I’d be an idiot not to spend the rest of my life with him. — Amy CallnerImageI'm in the middle, wearing my Charm City Roller Girls jersey.Can I Take Your Picture? When the days are so long and you finally get to the weekend and realize it’s been months since you have been out with your partner without your little one too (beloved though she is), a stranger asks, “Hey, when is the last time you took a photo together?” You smile because you can’t remember when the last time was, and you do find him pretty cute even if you two fight sometimes and say things you shouldn’t. The camera flashes, and you come back to each other and to the fact that love doesn’t fail even when you do.  — Fantasia NorseImageThe picture taken by a kind stranger.“I Gout You, Babe”The relationship had one big hurdle: my drinking. Alcohol was my evening crutch, and if that meant passing out by 8 p.m. every night, then so be it. But she stuck with me. Why, I don’t really know. Finally, one day, intense foot pain arose. “It’s gout,” said the doctor. “No more beer — try water instead.” The drinking subsided, the relationship soared and bad puns filled in where the booze had been. “I really like the footing on which we find ourselves,” I’d say via text, to which she’d reply, “I gout you, babe.” — Josh LefkowitzImageMy first surgical shoe.Traveling 6,584 Miles to Meet MeWhen I was young and had trouble sleeping, I would ask my mother to tell me the story of how she and my father traveled 6,584 miles to meet me at an orphanage in Hefei, China. I used to think the adoption process was easy, until years later when I went into our family’s safe and found the detailed essays that my mother and father had written explaining why they wanted to become parents. These documents remind me that our family is connected not by blood but by my parents’ love and their determination to make our family whole. — Lucy SearsImageWith my parents before my high school prom.I Love a Man With an Anchor TattooBefore leaving my studio apartment in Queens, I emailed my friends: “When I come back from Maine, I’ll bring home a lobsterman with an anchor tattoo.” I was joking, but then I spotted him — head to toe in yellow oilskins (just like a guy on a frozen fish box), climbing off his vintage Honda motorcycle.

5c5426c13a125f5075c0785a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/smarter-living/how-to-do-a-data-cleanse.html,"If we need a checkup on our health, our finances or our cars, we can find doctors, accountants or mechanics. But who checks up on our digital lives?There’s no such thing as 10,000-mile scheduled maintenance for your hard drive or an oil change for your smartphone. You’re on your own.Some people go years without giving their data much thought. As we start a new year, here’s one more item to wedge onto your New Year New You list: a comprehensive checkup on your own data.Following these four steps takes some time and attention, but it’s the only sure way to avoid eventual data disaster.Have you backed up your data?Sooner or later, your hard drive will die.Even its manufacturer admits it. Right there in the manual’s fine print, you can find its M.T.B.F. That’s “mean time between failures,” or “typical time until it croaks.”If that drive contains the only copies of your files and photos, then your countdown to catastrophe has begun.What you need is an automatic, continuous backup system — something that only 6 percent of us have set up.The easiest solution is an online backup service like Backblaze, which is preferred by Wirecutter for its low cost —$50 a year — and lack of size limits. Its software continuously copies your computer’s contents to the cloud. Should disaster strike, you can download your stuff right back again.ImageOnline backup services like Backblaze require an annual fee, but they’re entirely automated and invisible until a crisis.Better yet, these backups are offsite. Fire, flood and fiendish burglars are no longer your concern. (Well, they’re not great, but at least you won’t lose the sole copy of your data should your computer be damaged, destroyed or go missing.)The downside, of course, is paying that fee forever.For that reason, some people prefer backing up their stuff onto a second, external hard drive. Wirecutter suggests the 4-terabyte Western Digital My Book, which costs about $100.Once it’s connected, you can set up the Mac’s Time Machine feature or Windows’s File History feature to do the backing up, quietly and automatically.The drawbacks of this system: First, your backup isn’t offsite, so a local disaster can take down both the original and the backup. Second, no backing up takes place unless the external drive is plugged into your computer — something to remember if you’re a laptop lugger.There’s a third option, by the way, that’s ideal for a household with several computers. For about $300, you can buy a huge hard drive that connects to your Wi-Fi network and backs up all of your machines wirelessly.In order to scare off novices, the industry calls these drives NAS (network-attached storage) devices. They’re usually not simple to set up, but the result is free, wireless, continuous backup of all the computers in your house.Are your phone’s photos safe?Ask a hundred people what they’d rescue first from a burning house, and you’ll hear a lot of “my photos.”Dropbox, Flickr, Apple’s iCloud and other companies can back up your phone’s photos and videos, wirelessly and automatically. But they’re free only if you have a tiny photo collection. If your picture collection is of real-world size, you’ll have to pay. (It’s $36 a year for 200 gigabytes for iCloud, for example.)But two excellent services, Google Photos and Amazon Photos, can back up your complete photo collection for free, with a footnote apiece:Google’s promise: Unlimited, free backups of all the pictures and short videos on your phones, tablets and computers, with spectacular searching and sharing features once they’re online.The catch: Google’s algorithms compress your photos to take up less space. Now, unless your camera takes photos larger than 20 megapixels, it’s impossible to see the difference between the downgraded copies and the originals. Still, deep down, it may bug you to know that you haven’t uploaded exact copies. (Google Photos can back up the exact originals for a fee: $36 a year for 200 gigabytes, for example, or for free if you buy a Google phone.)Amazon Photos offers the same free service without compressing your photos. It can automatically back up either your computer’s photo stash or your phone’s (iPhone or Android).The catch: It’s part of Amazon Prime, the $119-a-year service that offers free two-day shipping, streaming movies and music, discounts at Whole Foods and other features.If you’re among the 100 million Americans who are already Prime members, great! It’s a good bet that you didn’t even know about this feature.Have you cleaned out your machine?Nobody knows where the term “cruft” came from. Maybe it began life as a reference to Harvard’s Cruft Laboratory, or maybe it’s some mash-up of “crust,” “crud” and “stuff.” In any case, that’s what it is: crust, crud and stuff that builds up over time.Software cruft refers to digital dust bunnies: duplicate files, orphaned “temporary” files, forgotten downloads, files attached to ancient emails, abandoned files from apps you deleted, and so on.Cruft is bad. As it piles up, it can waste a shocking amount of storage space. Eventually, it can slow down your machine.Fortunately, Apple, Microsoft and Google have all recently joined a global anti-cruft crusade. They’ve each added cruft-removal tools to their operating systems. You just have to remember to use them:Windows 10: From the Start menu, open Settings, System and then Storage. If you click “Free up space now,” Windows displays a list of cruft categories that it’s safe to delete, and shows how many gigabytes you’ll reclaim.Here, you can also turn on Storage Sense, which prevents cruft from accumulating in the first place. (Click “Change how we free up space automatically” to adjust the frequency of the deletions.)ImageWindows 10 offers a simple way to reclaim disk space from orphaned files.Mac: Apple’s cruft cruncher can reclaim huge swaths of space. (It’s available on macOS High Sierra and later.) To see it, from the Apple menu, choose About This Mac; click Storage; and then Manage.Here, you’ll see options like “Automatically remove watched iTunes movies and TV shows” and “Download only recent attachments” (in the Mail app). Click Review Files to see a sortable list of everything on your drive, which makes it easy to spot duplicates, or your biggest and oldest files, and delete them.ImageThe Mac, too, suggests ways to pinpoint abandoned and gigantic files for deletion.Android: Beginning with the Oreo version of Android, Google has made it fantastically easy to clean out junk files from your phone: Tap Settings, Storage & Memory, and then “Free Up Space.” The resulting list includes downloaded files, photos and videos that you’ve already backed up, and apps you haven’t used in some time. You can delete them by category or individually.ImageWhen your Android phone is feeling stuffed, open Settings to lighten its load.iOS: On the iPhone or iPad, tap Settings, General, and then iPhone Storage. You’re now facing iOS’s cruft-removal options: Offload Unused Apps, Review iTunes Videos (enormous TV and movie files), plus an app-by-app listing of space gobblers. Music, Photos, Podcasts and TV usually top the list.To delete the individual songs, videos, photos and other files that are eating up your space, you still have to open the corresponding app. But at least now you know where to begin.ImageThe iPhone and iPad make it easy to see which big and underused apps are junking up your storage.More sophisticated cruft-crunching apps are available online — some free, some not. But start with these free, built-in options.Is your software up-to-date?Every year, Apple, Microsoft and Google offer free updates to their phone and computer operating systems. Each update generally makes your machine more secure, less buggy and more richly featured.The operative word, of course, is generally. Grizzled computer veterans are full of stories about the time some upgrade fried their PCs, introduced bugs or took away beloved features.Maybe that’s why some people avoid installing the updates, which do, after all, take time to install and learn.But here’s the thing: Software companies don’t create these updates to make your life miserable, or even to make money. (The updates are usually free.) Their primary motivation is making your machine better so you’ll love it enough to buy the same brand the next time.Thanks to better (and more public) testing, it’s been a long time since any of these companies introduced a disastrous operating system release. By all means, study the reviews of the latest update. But if it seems fine, make the jump. You generally wind up with a computer or phone that runs faster, feels newer and does a better job at resisting internet nastiness.Have a Happy New YearFour steps, four nagging projects, four ways to ensure a better future for your life’s data. Having to perform this kind of nerdy checkup may not be your idea of fun, but look at the bright side: It costs a lot less than visiting a doctor, accountant or mechanic."

""We've got mail,"" she said.“You Can’t Escape Heartbreak or Capitalism”We had broken up outside of Cold Stone Creamery, and now we were in Target, where my puffy eyes turned to the Valentine’s Day cards. It was Jan. 7, and the breakup felt just as premature as the heart-covered greetings. He nudged me and pointed them out: “Too soon?” I choked out a polite laugh. There is something funny about ending almost three years together in a strip mall in the middle of suburbia. No matter how hard you try, you can’t escape heartbreak or capitalism. — Katrina SchmidtImageNot what you want to see after a breakup.Hostile New WorldHe popped up. Ten miles away. GPS for sex. Ricardo was visiting Los Angeles from San Diego, the thrum of a music festival pumping through his veins. When I saw him, my heart jumped into my throat, trying to make its way out of my eyes — tears of joy. Now, three years later, we are navigating this increasingly hostile new world, holding hands. Just two queer Latino men finding all the sweetness life has hidden from us. Tying our hearts together to defeat the darkness, like Pablo Neruda did with his Matilde. — Edwin Alexis GómezImageMe, above, and that's Ricardo squinting.Phil and PhillipMy son, Phil, and I came back to New York City from Seattle for the holidays. We rode from Manhattan to Brooklyn in a crowded subway car. A stranger was kind enough to let my child sit. Phil asked his grandpa, Phillip, to sit, and then fell asleep on him. No other seats became available during our hourlong ride. My father has Parkinson’s disease. He struggled but held my son tightly. As we exited the train, his arms shook with fatigue. Decades ago, that same man used to rock me to sleep on packed trains. Those rides were magical to a child. — Kat LieuImageMy son, Phil, and my father, Phillip, asleep on the D train.Now It’s All Fresh FishWe are grandparents. The age when most couples stay put. “We need something new,” I said as our Trader Joe’s fish defrosted in our suburban Maryland kitchen. “Why not sell the house? We’re retired and the kids are settled. And you know it’s been my dream to live abroad while we still can.” My dream, not his. He looked at me, his face inscrutable. Three years, two funerals and two weddings later, we still eat fish for dinner. But it’s caught in Clew Bay, near our home in the shadow of Croagh Patrick. We’re old, we’re new, we’re together, in Ireland. — Roberta BearyImageLobster traps in Clew Bay, Ireland.More Tiny Love StoriesTiny Love Stories: ‘Don’t Message Me if You Can’t Handle a Real Woman’Jan. 1, 2019Tiny Love Stories: ‘If You’re Reading This, Nick, I Love You’Dec. 25, 2018See more Tiny Love Stories at nytimes.com/modernlove.Submit yours at nytimes.com/tinylovestories.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

Or is the former vice president woefully behind the times? This week on “The Argument,” Michelle Goldberg says that allegations of inappropriate touching are just one reason Biden is too out of step with his party to run for president. Ross Douthat thinks Mr. Biden should run by defending his record as a moderate, not distancing himself from it. And David Leonhardt argues that a Biden candidacy could help the Democratic Party, even if he doesn’t win the nomination.Then, why are young Americans having less sex — and what does it say about the country?

In my bio, I said I’m a big lady so don’t message me if you can’t handle a real woman. Of the people who replied, one said, “I’m willing to go on a diet with you.” We met in November, dated in December and had our New Year’s date. Four years later, on the eve of the new millennium, we got married.

Post-scare, I remember telling my sister about the stressful ordeal. Incredulous, she chided, “Neither of you confessed your undying love? That tells you everything about the state of your ‘relationship.’” Yes, we’ve never said, “I love you.” But he did think of me when he thought a missile was coming. — Gabriella EtoniruImageOur text exchange that day.Party of TwoWe moved to New Jersey from Ohio on Jan. 1. A year later, we still had no friends, no invitations for New Year’s Eve. That afternoon, Eli barreled down the stairs to announce that we were having a party. “With who?” I asked. “With each other,” he said. I wore sequins. We danced, played Jenga, wrote predictions and sealed them in an envelope. We left a note in the neighbor’s mailbox saying we liked their Christmas lights. We drank champagne, threw a ball back and forth 200 times, talked with British accents, and, at midnight, we kissed. — Monique BernsteinImageThe day we moved into our new home.“Rushing for a Knife Could Be Alarming”For Christmas, I gave him an expensive chef’s knife. It was better than mine, even though I am the more enthusiastic cook. Right after New Year’s, standing in his beige, Burbank living room, he broke up with me without explanation. As I cried and screamed, I thought about the knife in the next room and considered retrieving it. He didn’t deserve that knife. I also knew, in that moment, rushing for a knife could be alarming in a get-you-arrested kind of way. So I didn’t get it. But I still think about that damn knife every day. — Shannon LatimerImageCooking chicken Provençal at my friend's house.Our Gratitude JarWe’re supposed to open the jar on New Year’s Day, hung over in our pajamas, reading the little notes of gratitude we had written to each other throughout the year.

Every time I saw him pause during a happy evening to write down a memory in his delicate script, I unscrewed the jar, pulled out the Post-it (despite his halfhearted protest) and smiled as I read his words: gratitude for our health, our home, our family, our dog, our friendship and love.

5c3762793a125f5075c03bd6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/gaga-r-kelly-apology.html,"Lady Gaga, the pop singer and Academy Award hopeful for her role in “A Star Is Born,” became the latest musician to apologize for collaborating with R. Kelly, the R&B singer who has long been accused of sexual misconduct and preying on teenagers, after the broadcast of an explosive investigative documentary detailing the allegations against him.In a post across her social media channels just after midnight on Thursday, Lady Gaga said she was sorry for making the song “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013 and pledged to remove the track from iTunes and other streaming platforms.“I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young and for not speaking out sooner,” she wrote, citing her own trauma from being sexually assaulted. “My intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn’t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life.”I stand by anyone who has ever been the victim of sexual assault: pic.twitter.com/67sz4WpV3i— Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) January 10, 2019
Lady Gaga, along with artists like Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper, has for years faced criticism for collaborating with Kelly, with scrutiny intensifying again as a result of the documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired on Lifetime. (Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him.)[Read more about the decades of sexual abuse allegations detailed in the documentary.]“Do What U Want” was controversial when it debuted, with many fans rejecting the collaboration based on much earlier reports about Kelly’s behavior with women. The single’s music video, which was never released, was shot and directed by the photographer Terry Richardson, who has also faced repeated accusations of sexual misconduct.Lady Gaga previously defended the song, calling it a “natural collaboration.” At a 2013 news conference, she said, “R. Kelly and I have sometimes very untrue things written about us, so in a way this was a bond between us.”Following the airing of the Lifetime series, Chance the Rapper apologized “to all of his survivors for working with him and for taking this long to speak out.” He added: “The truth is any of us who ever ignored the R. Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls.”[Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.]Representatives for Jay-Z, who released collaborative albums with Kelly in 2002 and 2004, have declined to comment. Sony Music, which oversees Kelly’s record label, RCA, has also declined to comment on the allegations.In her post, Lady Gaga wrote: “I stand behind these women 1000 percent, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously.” The singer has previously spoken out about her own sexual assault at age 19. In 2015, she released “Til It Happens to You,” a ballad about sexual assault for the documentary “The Hunting Ground,” which examined the issue of campus rape.“If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self,” Lady Gaga added in her apology, “I’d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in.”“Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in six parts last week, covered the long history of allegations against Kelly and featured women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers.“I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary.Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta are now looking into the allegations against him, and have called for potential witnesses and victims to come forward.[Laughing at R. Kelly helped us ignore the charges against him. No longer, a Times culture critic writes.]In 1994, when Kelly was 27, he married the singer Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton died in a plane crash in 2001.Kelly was also accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the journalist Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Kelly.In 2002, a video that appeared to show Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police.Later that year, Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. In the more than five years it took for his case to go to trial, he continued to release popular music, including the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” He was found not guilty."

The Massachusetts senator talks antitrust policy, her proposed wealth tax and universal child care program, and how to run against President Trump. But if that’s too much political wonkery for you, there’s a very good boy named Bailey who loves ear scratches in there, too.Then, Michelle Goldberg and Ross Douthat join David to debate whether Warren’s economic agenda can win her the White House. Ross thinks that the Democratic primary fight is shaping up to pit redistributive programs like Bernie Sanders’s against systemic economic overhauls like Warren’s. Michelle worries that superior policy may not be enough to elevate Warren with voters. And David thinks that Warren’s other liabilities — her claims of Native American heritage and her professorial background — are the biggest threats to her candidacy.Finally, Ross revisits a refreshing recommendation of David’s.ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren at a campaign event in New York.CreditGabriela Bhaskar for The New York TimesBackground Reading:Ross on Warren’s Native-American-heritage fiascoMichelle on the Democratic primary as a contest of ideas and sexism in the 2020 Democratic fieldDavid on C.E.O. compensation and taxing the rich, Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act and for-profit collegesLast week’s episode of “The Argument,” on universal prekindergartenMeet the HostsRoss DouthatImageI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect.

Liz Day, a senior story editor for The Times’s new television show, “The Weekly,” discussed the tech she’s using.“The Weekly” is something new that’s coming from The Times. What should we know about it?It’s The Times’s most ambitious TV project ever: a 30-minute documentary show, premiering in June, that will air on FX on Sunday nights and then stream on Hulu. We’re taking great reporting from the Times newsroom and bringing it to TV for a new audience. You should tune in.You’ve also worked at ProPublica and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” What kind of tech did you use in those workplaces?At ProPublica, we used databases like LexisNexis Public Records for people-finding, Pacer for federal court records and Factiva for news clips. Because investigative reporters are often looking for those who don’t want to be found, we’d also keep an eye out for weird sites that promised to unearth off-the-grid cellphone numbers or scrape the deep web.ProPublica has a wonderful open-source culture devoted to the public interest. Anytime they got their hands on unruly government data, the talented folks there would build an app to make access easy. Thanks to them, you can look up your doctor to see how much money he or she gets from drug companies.When I joined “Last Week Tonight,” I discovered a whole new world of video that I hadn’t known existed. Did you know there’s a database where you can search all of President Trump’s video appearances, including a vlog he kept from 2011 to 2014? Or that the wizards behind the Wayback Machine have a tool where you can search the closed captions for local, cable and network TV news from the last decade?We also used Scripto, a program for writing and producing television that Stephen Colbert helped build.ImageMs. Day with Jason Stallman, the editor of “The Weekly.” They use Frame.io to share or watch cuts of episodes.CreditSangsuk Sylvia Kang for The New York TimesWhat are your most important gadgets and apps for doing your job?Lame answer but definitely my iPhone. Depending on the type of person I’m communicating with, I’ll use text, Slack, WhatsApp or a regular old telephone call. On my laptop, I use Google Docs, Evernote, Scrivener, Airtable and Dropbox. We use Frame.io to share or watch cuts of episodes.More old school: giant spiral-bound notebooks. It feels soothing to write in them. But if I need to work from home after hours, I sometimes end up having to take photos of my handwritten notes.What tech do you love to use in your personal life and why?My husband has Sonos speakers set up around our apartment. It often feels as if I use them to fill every moment at home with podcasts and news. Every once in a while, I remember how nice it is to listen to music instead.For reading, I use email newsletters and Instapaper, and we share a Kindle account so we can read the same books. I use Twitter to find unusual news or stuff that makes me laugh. I fall down Instagram rabbit holes all the time. An unexpected app I still use is Foursquare. I love seeing all the spots where my husband and I went 10 years ago.I have no interest in Alexa, but we do have SmartThings, which sends your phone an alert every time your front door opens. I just got a letter that our (low-tech) building is installing a new buzzer system that has facial recognition. So I guess I will be using that soon, too!I was given Beats wireless headphones as a gift. Initially, I thought they were for teens, but now I wear them all the time for travel and sometimes even sleep in them.I almost never go to brick-and-mortar stores anymore, so I enjoy buying little treats from New York Magazine’s The Strategist. There’s always a magic skin care potion or some other fun new product that promises to improve your life for $15.ImageMs. Day said Apple TV and iTunes were a lot easier than her first replacement for cable TV a decade ago: “infecting my laptop with God-knows-what from various Napster-esque video streaming sites.”CreditSangsuk Sylvia Kang for The New York TimesWhat is your personal TV setup, and has it changed?I cut the cord in 2008. It was funny because at the time, my job was to analyze what people liked to watch on TV. But on principle, I resent that there’s barely any choice of cable TV providers.I spent a while infecting my laptop with God-knows-what from various Napster-esque video streaming sites.But now it’s so easy. We have Apple TV, where we subscribe to apps from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Showtime and HBO and then buy anything else a la carte from iTunes. Sometimes, I listen to the audio podcast version of shows like “60 Minutes” or PBS’s “Frontline.”I know that sounds like I must watch a lot of TV, but I swear I really don’t. It’s fun to follow the TV industry like sports — keeping an eye on what’s new, what’s a hit and what has bombed. You can learn a lot about the world by understanding what people watch on TV!What do you do to take a break from tech?Hot yoga. Sixty minutes in a 100-plus-degree room standing on one leg. Or nightly walks around the neighborhood with my husband. No phones and just laughs."

5c5af2b83a125f5075c084cd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/dealbook/spotify-gimlet-anchor-podcasts.html,"When Spotify began more than 10 years ago, it had a simple goal: to establish itself as a force in the music business by making millions of songs instantly available to listeners worldwide. But with its announcement on Wednesday that it had acquired two podcast companies, the streaming service sent a strong signal that it has broader ambitions.No longer does it aim to be a go-to destination for just music fans. It now sees itself as a provider of online audio, period.The company’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, emphasized the shift in direction in a blog post on Wednesday. “I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished, but what I didn’t know when we launched to consumers in 2008 was that audio — not just music — would be the future of Spotify,” he wrote.In announcing its fourth-quarter earnings, the Stockholm company said it had acquired Gimlet Media, the studio behind the popular podcasts “Crimetown,” “Reply All” and “StartUp,” and Anchor, which makes tools for recording and distributing podcasts. Financial terms of the transactions were not disclosed.With the acquisitions, Spotify becomes the latest player to invest in a medium once considered a low-stakes sandbox in the larger media environment. Now that podcasts have become part of the listening routine for millions of people, major companies have recognized them as an important — but still relatively cheap — source of content.In September, the radio giant iHeartMedia bought Stuff Media, another influential producer, and recently Hollywood has begun buying up rights to popular podcasts. “Homecoming,” an Amazon series starring Julia Roberts, is based on a fictional podcast from Gimlet.“I don’t think Spotify woke up one day and realized that audio storytelling has some incredible emotional place in the life of their brand,” said Owen Grover, the chief executive of Pocket Casts, a podcast app. “Strategically, if they can get their users to listen to podcasts in place of music, it improves their margins.”Gimlet’s shows will expand Spotify’s podcasting slate, which includes thousands of shows widely available on other platforms, as well as high-profile exclusive productions from the comedian Amy Schumer, the journalist Jemele Hill, the rapper Joe Budden and others.“We are still at the dawn of the second golden age of audio, and we know Spotify is a perfect partner and platform to take Gimlet — and podcasting at large — to a new level,” Alex Blumberg and Matthew Lieber, the public radio veterans who founded Gimlet in 2014, said in a statement.Podcasts also offer a financial advantage, helping Spotify improve profit margin and reduce its dependence on the major record companies, whose licensing deals are by far its largest expense.While podcasts are hardly a new invention — they became part of Apple’s iTunes in 2005 — their popularity has surged in recent years. By some estimates, more than 600,000 podcasts are available through Apple, a number that does not include shows that are exclusive to other providers, like Spotify.But while it may seem as if every other person on earth is either a podcast listener or a podcast host, the money thrown off by the boomlet has been relatively modest. According to a study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC, the podcast industry as a whole generated $314 million in 2017, though that survey also predicts that by 2020 the number will more than double, to $659 million.Spotify, which went public in April, announced on Wednesday that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, 96 million of whom paid for monthly subscriptions. Its revenue for the year was 5.3 billion euros, about $6 billion, an increase of 29 percent from 2017.And while in 2018 the company lost €78 million, about $89 million, it had a net income of €442 million, or about $502 million, in its fourth quarter. Spotify’s gross profit margin also grew in that quarter, to 26.7 percent, from 25.3 percent in the previous three months.Despite Spotify’s dominance among music listeners (its chief rival, Apple Music, has 50 million paying subscribers), Mr. Ek, the company’s chief executive, predicted that “over time,” about 20 percent of all Spotify listening would involve something other than music.“Ultimately, if we are successful, we will begin competing more broadly for time against all forms of entertainment and informational services, and not just music streaming services,” Mr. Ek wrote in his blog post.For the music industry, which has become increasingly reliant on streaming revenue — yet has regularly tussled with Spotify over money — that may be seen as a signal that Spotify sees podcasts as a cheaper way to satisfy its customers. Barry McCarthy, Spotify’s chief financial officer, has frequently pointed to podcasts as a way to increase the company’s margins.“Even though music rights holders think Spotify is underpaying for their music, Spotify has struggled thus far to make the economics work,” Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst at Midia Research, said. “But Spotify cannot wait to play the long game, so it sees podcasts as a nearer-term way of populating its service with higher-margin content.”For some observers, the Spotify deal also suggests an end to the Wild West era of podcasting, in which Apple played the role of disinterested host to numerous shows from all kinds of independent producers.“This is the end of the open era,” said Nick Quah, the writer of HotPod, a popular newsletter about podcasts. “Apple never picked winners and losers. A guy or a lady in the grandma’s basement had the same position as ‘This American Life,’ and they battled it out for listeners.”“In the new balance of power,” he added, “winners and losers might not be made in the same way.”"

5c514bed3a125f5075c07090,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/learning/do-you-listen-to-podcasts.html,"How familiar are you with the growing world of podcasting? Do you have some favorites? What do you like about them? When and how do you tend to listen?If you’ve never listened to a podcast, what subjects do you think might interest you?Rachel Holliday Smith introduces “A Beginner’s Guide to Getting Into Podcasts” by writing:As a content-obsessed millennial, podcasts have long been ingrained in my daily routine. I listen while commuting, cooking, running errands, putting away laundry, washing dishes or during any relatively mindless activity that can be done while wearing wireless headphones.My bond with podcasts is so cemented that it comes as a shock when someone I meet at a party — or someone in my family, or a friend I thought I knew — tells me that they, in the year 2019, do not listen to podcasts. And never have. And don’t really get what it’s all about. And, worse, don’t quite know how to start.Their reasons range from “I don’t have time” to “It’s passed me by” to “What should I even listen to?” Luckily, those concerns are easily answered and dispatched. For anyone who wants to become a full-fledged podcast listener, here’s what you need to know to get into it, from experts who know best.She then goes on to give some advice, including ...Take the show on the roadPodcasts are all about killing two birds with one stone by listening while you do other things. For Mr. Quah of Hot Pod, “that’s part of the fun of it.”“A lot of the world feels a little boring sometimes, so having that layer on top of it is great,” he said.Find the things you really want to hear... If it feels overwhelming, it’s not just you: Though podcasts have been around for at least a decade, there’s still no central database or clearinghouse for the thousands of podcasts out there, Ms. Gerber-Margie said.“A lot of discovery happens via the way you choose to listen. There’s no ‘New York Times best-seller list,’” she said.However, big podcasting powerhouses are a great first place to look. National Public Radio produces many worthwhile podcasts, including “Invisibilia,” “Planet Money” and the daily news show “Up First.” Likewise, public radio stations across the country produce a ton of great shows, like “Last Seen” by Boston’s WBUR and “Making Obama” by Chicago’s WBEZ, and large podcasting studios — Radiotopia, Gimlet Media, Maximum Fun — will give a range of solid choices with excellent production value. (We list some of our favorite shows below.)To mix in niche or offbeat podcasts with your brand-name shows, Mr. Quah of Hot Pod suggests going the old-fashioned route: word-of-mouth endorsements.“Find your local young person who listens to podcasts and get that person to cough up a few recommendations,” he said. “Part of the pleasure is combining your listening playlist with something everybody knows and loves — like ‘This American Life’ or something like it — with something that’s roughly edited, but feels specifically for you.”For him, that means hourslong shows on N.B.A. predictions. For James T. Green, a Brooklyn-based artist and audio producer, it means experimental audio like the work showcased on “Constellations,” a Canadian audio art podcast, and “The Black Guy Who Tips,” a comedy and current events talk show created by Charlotte, N.C., husband-and-wife pair Rod and Karen Morrow. Mr. Green has listened to the couple for years, ever since a dull desk job led him to search “black podcast” in the Apple podcast directory.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:— Did you find any advice in this article especially useful? What? Why?— If you are already a podcast fan, tell us about some of your favorites. Would you recommend them to others?

What subjects do you think would interest you most?— Scroll through some of the recommendations given at the end of this article, or take a look at some of the top podcasts on the Stitcher app or the top-ranking shows on iTunes. Which of these look interesting? Why?— How is listening to a podcast different from, say, watching a TV show, listening to the radio or reading a book? Do you think instead of reading, say, “Moby-Dick,” you might enjoy a podcast in which chapters of the novel are read by different actors? Can you imagine a sports podcast that would be as interesting as watching a game live?— This article suggests that one way to add podcasts to your daily life is to listen while you do other things. When during your average day might you fit in listening to a podcast?Related: This April we’ll be running our Second Annual Student Podcasting Contest.

5c4b249d3a125f5075c06523,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/movies/streaming-car-wash.html,"Every decade or so, Hollywood produces a movie that is not only entertaining but also raises the question just what is entertainment.The 1934 musical “Stand Up and Cheer,” in which the president of the United States appoints a secretary of amusement to dispel the Depression, is an example of what could be called meta-entertainment. Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy” (1983) and Ben Stiller’s “Cable Guy” (1996), both self-reflexively predicated on characters who are mass-culture personified, are others. So is Michael Schultz’s 1976 “Car Wash.”A movie in which mass media, specifically radio, exerts a powerful influence on its characters’ lives, “Car Wash” is an energetic, vulgar, socially conscious farce — scored by the master of psychedelic soul Norman Whitfield and focusing on a single day at the Dee-Luxe Car Wash in downtown Los Angeles. It manages to have its cake and eat it too: The film is simultaneously downbeat and uplifting. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby called it “a terrifically shrewd piece of movie-making,” noting that “if ‘Car Wash’ makes no comment on our pop culture, it’s because it’s a piece of it.”Yet “Car Wash” does comment on itself: The contradictions between their labor and our leisure are manifest in the irresistible title song. Punctuated by the exhortation “work and work and work,” the song by the soul group Rose Royce explains that while the Dee-Luxe is “no place to be if you plan on being a star” (never mind that at least in the final credits just about everyone gets to be one), it’s “better than digging a ditch” (what isn’t?) and “the boss don’t mind if you act the fool” (of course not). Heard over the radio, the tune sets the Dee-Luxe employees bopping while they work in a speeded-up version of the Funky Robot dance. Has a $3-an-hour job ever been more fun?“Car Wash” evolved out of the 1970s blaxploitation genre: Schultz, the director, had a hit with the coming-of-age drama “Cooley High,” and the screenplay was by Joel Schumacher, who wrote the Motown-influenced showbiz musical, “Sparkle.” In other ways, too, “Car Wash” is a quintessential 1970s film. Political exhaustion and economic recession are never far below its candy-colored surface.Unsympathetic reviewers saw “Car Wash” as a lowbrow imitation of “American Graffiti” (1973) or “Nashville” (1975). “It has no more class than Hostess Twinkie,” Pauline Kael wrote, adding “it, too, may make you gag.” But “Car Wash” is more a critique of those movies. That which was freewheeling and expansive, whether teenage car-culture in “American Graffiti” or boomtown star-making in “Nashville,” is here drastically downsized.A microcosm of Hollywood, the Dee-Luxe is a stage, and everyone, except perhaps the anxious boss, Mr. B (Sully Boyar), and his gruff ex-con employee, Lonnie (Ivan Dixon), entertains a fantasy or at least wields a shtick. Fittingly, the cast is packed with stand-up comics — Franklyn Ajaye, George Carlin, Irwin Corey and Richard Pryor. The most compelling dreams belong to the playfully romantic T.C. (Ajaye) and the sullen black nationalist Abdullah (Bill Duke), formerly Duane.T.C.’s childish fantasy of being a black superhero parallels that of the boss’s pot-smoking son (Richard Brestoff), who wears a Mao T-shirt and tells dad’s employees, “Brothers, I’m here to unite with you!” Abdullah’s tortured self-invention is contrasted with that of the self-confident snappy queen Lindy (Antonio Fargas) who, in the movie’s best-known line, tells Abdullah, “I’m more man than you’ll ever be and more woman than you’ll ever get.”Abdullah also mixes it up with and fails to faze the resplendently smiling Daddy Rich (Pryor), the founder of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, transported to the Dee-Luxe in a gold limousine accompanied by a glam gospel trio (the Pointer Sisters). Their song is an utterly transparent riff on his con man’s appeal: “You gotta believe in something, why not believe in me?”The Dee-Luxe crew includes Latinos, a Native American and one hapless white dude, but the perspective is black. Not that the African-American press was universally favorable. The Amsterdam News called “Car Wash” “something Stephen Foster might have written about a day in the life of black folk on an antebellum plantation.” Or a movie lot. That the harried owner, his nitwit son and the brash, insecure cashier played by Melanie Mayron are Jewish suggests that the carwash might be a metaphor for the entertainment industry.The Jewish characters are well-meaning but clueless, like Carlin’s white liberal cabdriver. The white customers are privileged brats basically making a mess for media-addled minimum-wage workers to clean up. The Guardian, a Marxist weekly — fancifully suggesting an ideological connection to Lenin’s manifesto “What Is to Be Done?” — noted that the movie “poses the day-to-day practical experience of the working class against the ‘abstract’ theory of those who would politicize it.”“Car Wash” has its flaws. The most obvious is that the female roles are underwritten and cursory, including the glum hooker played by Schultz’s wife, Lauren Jones. But the movie is sensitive to heartache, Abdullah’s not the least. “It’s all falling apart, man,” he admits to Lonnie, whose situation is only marginally less hopeless. However the bright orange uniforms worn by Dee-Luxe employees appeared in 1976, they now seem eerily predictive of prison jumpsuits. The perfunctory happy ending is suffused with melancholy.Yet to be included in the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry, “Car Wash” is a landmark. It provided a showcase for Pryor, the most bankable black star between Sidney Poitier and Eddie Murphy, who was subsequently directed by Schultz in “Greased Lightning” and “Which Way Is Up?” (both 1977). “Car Wash” also features Garrett Morris, an original member of the “Saturday Night Live” cast, and is distinguished by the presence of two notable directors, Ivan Dixon and Bill Duke, as well as the multitalented pioneer Clarence Muse.It was the first movie by an African-American director shown in competition at Cannes; there would not be another until Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” a 1989 film for which “Car Wash” furnished a template. Schultz serves as a template himself — he directed more feature-length Hollywood movies than any black director before Lee.“Car Wash” is available on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Player, and Starz; “Cooley High” is available on Vudu."

Did I Deserve It?”Meet the HostsRoss DouthatImageI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.Michelle GoldbergImageI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.David LeonhardtImageI’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.More from Opinion on 2018:The Year in Pictures 2018Dec. 19, 2018Opinion | Rosie SchaapThe Best New Year’s Eve Party Is in Seat 17ADec. 27, 2018OpinionThe Year In Illustration 2018Dec. 28, 2018OpinionWhat Are Your Hopes for 2019?Dec. 28, 2018How do I listen?Tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.

5c6d87eb3a125f5075c0aa04,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/movies/sofia-coppola-director-writer.html,"The writer-director Sofia Coppola, fortune’s child, is blessed and cursed for reasons beyond her control. Is it an advantage or disadvantage to have a supportive, larger-than-life father who is a world-famous filmmaker?While it’s no stretch to rank Coppola alongside Kathryn Bigelow as the two women with the most longevity on the movie industry’s A-list, it should be noted that on the basis of six features she’s directed since 1999, she’s also the most celebrated American filmmaker under 50. (Paul Thomas Anderson is the only other contender.)She won an Oscar for writing “Lost in Translation” and a New York Film Critics Circle award for directing it. She received the Gold Lion award at the 2010 Venice Film Festival for “Somewhere” and was named best director at Cannes for her 2017 remake of “The Beguiled,” the dark comedy of manners she fashioned from Don Siegel’s overwrought male gothic.Coppola is a true auteur — a filmmaker with a distinct worldview and sensibility and a personal set of quasi-autobiographical interests. Where Bigelow works in genres that have up to now been dominated by men, Coppola’s are, to use her own term, “girlie.” Her protagonists are generally strong-willed women, whether as individuals (“Marie Antoinette”) or in groups (“The Virgin Suicides,” “The Bling Ring,” “The Beguiled”) or as part of an older man-younger woman pairing (“Lost in Translation,” “Somewhere”). Drawn to father-daughter situations, she is at work on another — her current project, “On the Rocks,” is about a young mother (Rashida Jones, daughter of Quincy Jones) reconnecting with her playboy father (Bill Murray).Her characters are typically and blithely privileged, often afflicted with ennui, if not affluenza. Her movies are usually set in protective, even rarefied surroundings: comfortable suburbs in “The Virgin Suicides” and “The Bling Ring,” exclusive hotels in “Lost in Translation” and “Somewhere,” a boarding school for young women in “The Beguiled,” and Versailles in “Marie Antoinette.”Coppola’s fondness for cosseted milieus is reinforced by a propensity to sanitize the past. “The Beguiled” not only evokes a bubble, it is one — a movie set in Virginia during the Civil War that seems oblivious to the state’s slave-driven economy. Similarly, “Marie Antoinette” shows as little interest in the social forces that ignited the French Revolution as it does in the hygienic practices of the royal court.Having grown up as Hollywood royalty, Coppola, 47, takes these insular worlds for granted. The prologue to her oeuvre is the script she contributed to a short directed by her father in the 1989 anthology film “New York Stories”; its star, an adorable, doted-upon schoolgirl (Heather McComb), lives with her often-absent parents at the Sherry-Netherland hotel and rewards a homeless man with chocolate kisses. (The prevailing message, Janet Maslin wrote in her New York Times review, is “more or less Marie Antoinette’s.”)ImageEmma Watson in “The Bling Ring,” directed by Sofia Coppola.CreditMerrick Morton/A24On the other hand, no director has greater access, emotionally or physically, to the rich and famous. It’s hard to say which is more remarkable, Coppola’s ability to do extensive filming at Versailles for “Marie Antoinette” or Paris Hilton’s mad narcissism in letting Coppola use her home as a major location for “The Bling Ring,” a movie about the actual burglarizing of Hilton’s home by a gang of well-off, star-struck teenagers who used online gossip sites to track the whereabouts of celebrities and plot their schemes.Coppola’s veteran male protagonists, Bill Murray in “Lost in Translation” and Stephen Dorff in “Somewhere,” are sympathetically portrayed celebrities adrift in their own stardom. (Dorff’s character, stricken with toxic superficiality, floats through a nervous breakdown.) But while “Lost in Translation” is Coppola’s sweetest film and “Somewhere” the saddest, her strongest movies are those whose characters have stardom imposed upon them or set out to steal it: “Marie Antoinette,” a costume movie whose worked-out choreography is the equivalent of an action extravaganza, and “The Bling Ring,” a deadpan satire.Scrumptious colors, magnificent sets and upbeat modern music aside, what’s impressive about “Marie Antoinette” is Coppola’s attitude — a bold refusal to Frenchify or even periodize her knockout cast, which stars Kirsten Dunst in the title role and Jason Schwartzman as her husband, the future Louis XVI. As a parody of monarchist protocol, “Marie Antoinette” anticipates “The Favourite” but loses its edge once Marie and Louis become adults. (The falloff is as drastic as the last 45 minutes of dad’s “Apocalypse Now” — another attempt to make history.)By contrast, “The Bling Ring,” a deceptively blasé, both-sides-now view of celebrity, never breaks character. More of an exposé than a narrative, Coppola’s account of the so-called Hollywood Hills Burglars is based on a true story (or rather its account in Vanity Fair). With everything refracted through the news media, “The Bling Ring” is both a critique and celebration. Strutting five abreast down Rodeo Drive, as though posing for an album cover, the members of the ring imagine themselves as stars in their own movie (too bad for them that a surveillance camera provided their onscreen debuts). “We don’t know how (or if) they think, and we don’t know quite what to think of them,” A.O. Scott wrote in his Times review.The two standout performances — Leslie Mann’s new-age airhead and, cast against type, Emma Watson as her bratty, stubbornly self-justifying daughter — are gutsy portrayals of appalling characters one loves to hate (or simply hates). But any moral satisfaction derived when the kids are busted is transitory. Onscreen and off, most of the real-life kids were rewarded with friend requests and fan pages, as well as with Coppola’s phlegmatic glamorizing film.Had Andy Warhol lived to see “Marie Antoinette” or “The Bling Ring,” he might have considered Coppola his favorite Hollywood director. (The significance paid to footwear in both films could not have failed to impress an artist who was, in his commercial phase, the acknowledged master of drawing shoes.) Coppola’s blankly comic dialogue — cascades of “Omigod!” punctuated by cries of “That’s so ill!” — are juxtaposed with pop images worthy of painters Ed Ruscha or David Hockney.“The Bling Ring” is uncompromising in its portrayal of banality and shallowness. In a certain sense there hasn’t been anything quite like it since Warhol filmed Edie Sedgwick in “Poor Little Rich Girl.”All six of Sofia Coppola’s films, as well as “New York Stories,” can be streamed via Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. “The Virgin Suicides” is also available from Hulu and “Marie Antoinette” from Netflix."
5cb00d9e49f0eacbf1f832f2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/style/modern-love-kidney-donation-secret.html,"The idea never crossed my mind until the afternoon I stood folding laundry and heard a woman on the radio telling the story of donating a kidney to someone she didn’t know.I had turned 50 the week before. I didn’t think I cared about this milestone, but then I had an epiphany: At last I was turning an age that would impress trees.In the weeks leading up to my birthday I kept telling everyone my tree theory, so I felt truly seen on the day itself when my beloved presented me with a bread board made from a slice of tree trunk. Dark and glossy, with legible rings and rough bark intact, it had a split — a crack in the wood that curved from outer rim to a little knot in the heart.College Students: Send Us Your 100-Word Love StoriesThis year’s Modern Love college essay contest expands by going small. We’re seeking all the (tiny) love that’s fit to print from undergraduates worldwide. Submit here.I’d met my beloved three years earlier. At first we were friends, both of us sorting through recent breakups. Then we began studying Torah together, wrestling over bits of text. Not just Torah, secular books too, and movies and paintings and philosophies and constellations. Sharing questions and interpretations, sometimes in harmony, sometimes in screeching discord (like the time I said, “Poor Tolstoy, he takes himself too seriously,” and almost severed our friendship for good).We were forever coming together and diverging, always in motion. Before I met him, I had developed a bad habit of ceding desire to others. I had put my body and mind too much at the disposal of other people, allowed them authority over me. I had become adept at exercising my will to negate my will. An ugly habit; it still fills me with shame.But now I found myself 50 and free — free to claim myself. And fit. For most of my life, I hadn’t really noticed the privilege of good health. I didn’t go around on a daily basis thinking, “Jackpot! Another day of not being sick!” But time had increased my awareness of how many people live with injury and illness, how uncommon it was that I had never suffered anything more grievous than having my wisdom teeth out. It had come to seem an embarrassment of unearned riches.Then there was the fact that two of my children were already out of the house and the youngest was in his last year of high school. Soon I wouldn’t be needed for day-to-day mothering. On top of that, I have an academic job, which means several months of paid discretionary time each summer. All of which added up to the recognition that I had a surplus ability to be more useful. In the weeks surrounding my 50th birthday, this sense of surplus, and the question of how to channel it, built in me like steam in an engine.When I heard the radio story about becoming an altruistic donor, it seemed an answer. I folded the last pair of socks, went to the computer and looked up kidney donation. I was uncomfortable with the phrase “altruistic donor,” which implied a lack of self-interest, when it was perfectly clear to me that I had great self-interest: It would make me feel good to be of use in this way.I came across an alternate phrase: non-directed donor. Not only was this objectively descriptive (the kidney would go to whoever needed it rather than to a designated recipient), it had a more proper emphasis: Instead of highlighting the motivation of the donor, it focused on the trajectory of the organ.I liked this better. Satisfied that I was being honest with myself about the role my own desire played in the decision, I applied to become a non-directed donor.I did this without telling anyone. Not even my beloved. For three weeks, in between filling out the online form and passing an initial telephone screening with the donor center, I kept my intention to myself.Only when I got an appointment to go in and meet with the donor coordinator did I tell my beloved, and then I did not say, “I’m thinking about doing this thing. What are your thoughts about it?” No. I told him I had decided. All I asked was that he accompany me through the process.He took a breath, held my hand, asked questions and said yes. I could see he was a little rattled, but I thought he just needed to get used to the idea. I didn’t realize then how much I had hurt him.The process began in earnest with scans and labs, a psychiatric evaluation, meetings with medical specialists, literature to review and a day of urinating exclusively into a big plastic jug. All the while I felt invigorated, almost giddy with my own sense of agency. Five months elapsed before the tests were completed and I received word I had been approved. I just had to sign the papers to get entered with the national registry, a kind of matchmaker service for organs.My beloved came with me. He took a breath as I signed, held my hand, asked questions and continued to say yes — yes with his presence, yes as he walked beside me, yes to accompanying me on my journey. But he was still hurt, both that I had made the decision alone and that I had withheld it from him those first few weeks.I explained that really it was my decision, my desire; that it was important for me to own this choice without seeking approval and without apology. And yet I saw how the hurt lingered. And this time I was the one who was a little rattled.The registry found me a match. A surgery date was arranged. My beloved took me to the hospital, kept me company, helped me change into a hospital gown, gave me away to the orderly who wheeled my gurney. The kidney was removed from my body and sent on its journey, destination unknown.All we learned was that the transplant was successful. As for my own journey, my beloved accompanied me every step of the way. He breathed with me through recovery, held my hand when I was in pain, walked laps with me around the floor, asked questions about home-care and said yes: yes with every bowl of broth he made me, yes with every load of wash he did, yes with every hour he spent away from his work, yes with every rumpled, exhausted, ready smile.And when I was well enough, we finally fought.“You hurt us,” he said. “When you decided this alone.”“But it was honest,” I said. “I needed to be free to decide on my own.”He nodded sadly. “But you hurt us.”There is a phrase in the Bible that talks about the relationship between Adam and Eve. It usually gets translated “helpmate,” as in, “I will make a helpmate suitable for him.” But the Hebrew, “ezer kenegdo,” may better be translated as “helper opposite” or “helper against.”In other words, it offers the suggestion that a true partner is one who can oppose us, challenge us, spar when necessary. What makes a good sparring partner? Trust. Trust that the other isn’t pulling any punches. And trust that you’re both in the ring for the same reason: not to hurt each other but to grow.Here’s what I understand now, nearly a year later: I really did need to make the decision alone. It was selfish — but for me, healthily selfish, a fierce reclamation of authority over my body and mind, and even more fierce: a way of honoring my desire.And I really did hurt us. By insisting on my journey, not ours, I created a rift. By not including my beloved in the decision, I made him feel distrusted.More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: ‘I Kept Falling in Love With Other People’April 2, 2019Beneath the Modest Alter Ego, I See My SuperheroNov. 12, 2006The surgery left me with four laparoscopic scars that are barely visible and one big scar that remains vivid. Most Fridays I bake challah for shabbat dinner. While it’s cooling, I set the table, put the candles in their holders, pour wine in the kiddush cup. When the bread is cool, I put it on the tree slice bread board, with its crack that runs from rim to center. The crack is about the size of my scar, the big one from the incision where they slid the kidney out.I don’t think about the kidney often. I sometimes think of the recipient. I feel immense gratitude toward this person whose need made it possible for me to fulfill my desire to be of use. In this sense we are partners, the recipient and me.And my own partner? He and I never stepped out of the ring. He was no more deterred by the rift than he is by my scar, which lies not so much between us as before us: a challenge we face together as we continue to spar, learning new steps, getting our timing down, trusting each other with more and more of our weight.Leah Hager Cohen teaches writing at the College of the Holy Cross.

5ca6d31c49f0eacbf1f810c5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/style/modern-love-wedding-ring-lost.html,"After Christmas last year, when my boyfriend’s children were with his ex-wife, he and I went on vacation with my daughters to a sunny spot far from our separate homes in Montana. We have been together for years, sometimes blending our children’s lives, sometimes not, feeling no need (I don’t think?) to define our arrangement with marriage.On this trip, we stayed in a spare beach cottage where I stared each day not at the sea but at four white bowls that were generously spaced along a wooden shelf above the kitchen sink. In the wake of another bloated Christmas, the simplicity of those bowls stood in stark contrast to the clutter I had left back home.By the end of our vacation, those bowls — never used, not a part of any real life at all, of course — had burned such a hole in my brain that within six hours of our return I had thrown out a dozen garbage bags of stuff, and I was just getting started. I was guided not only by the image of those four bowls but also a line an old friend used to say whenever I asked if he needed another beer: “Need is a funny word.”College Students: Send Us Your 100-Word Love StoriesThis year’s Modern Love college essay contest expands by going small. We’re seeking all the (tiny) love that’s fit to print from undergraduates worldwide. Submit here.Every day I threw out more stuff until, while taking a break to walk the dog, I started laughing at myself. I was acting ridiculous, chucking anything we didn’t need, not because I was suddenly obsessed with decluttering but because I was scheduled for surgery the following week, and I was scared. As a single parent who simply could not die, I was doing whatever I could to distract myself from the risks that lay ahead.No matter that the odds of my dying from surgery were minuscule; I was having a hysterectomy. It was just another way to unceremoniously throw away an object I no longer needed. My mother had done it at 40. I was 44, her only child.She died at 68, when I was 38, after radiation damage from her cancer treatments decades earlier. I wished I could talk to her about all this, but mostly I was trying to keep myself busy. I was my own bad joke. How could I not have seen what I was doing?As it turned out, surgery was a breeze, and I was back to my regular life in no time. The next week, walking my dog on a trail near my condo, I pulled out a ball for her to chase. When I threw it into a neighboring field filled with nearly two feet of snow, the only ring I wear sailed off my finger and vanished.I gasped. My mother had given me that ring, and the only time I had taken it off was for surgery the prior week. I couldn’t lose it.I was afraid to move, lest I disturb the snow, thinking that any surface indentation, no matter how tiny, might reveal my ring’s landing spot. I called my boyfriend. I called a friend who was watching my girls. The three of us collectively called a half-dozen stores and tracked down a used metal detector from a pawnshop.My friend drove with my girls to pick it up. It was after 2 p.m.; we had only a few hours of daylight left. While I waited for my friend to arrive with the metal detector, a pack of parents and children and dogs arrived with cross-country ski equipment. Though I was too dazed to remember, I must have told them I lost a ring because I heard them wondering aloud if it was my wedding ring.I didn’t answer.An older woman with another dog showed up and joined the skiing crowd. She was talking loudly, asking what was going on, and I was protecting my snow from their dogs, wishing they would leave me in silence to mourn. There was no way I would find it.When the skiers left, the woman came over and said, “Is it your wedding ring?”“No,” I said, too sharply.A few minutes later, a man ran by, making eye contact in a way that made me think he might know me — it’s a small town — but I didn’t recognize him. He stopped running and asked if I was all right. “You look distraught,” he said.“I lost my ring.”“Your wedding ring?”“No! I’m not married.” I didn’t mask my exasperation.I’d flustered him. He was so kind. I was so sad. He left, and I stared at the snow. No ring. No mother. No husband. Not even a uterus! How easy it would have been for me to dissolve into a pity party. But in reality, I was jazzed about the surgery. In reality, I love my life, my family, my boyfriend.Why did the wedding-ring assumption keep setting me off? On vacation, nearly everyone we met called my boyfriend my husband. Talking to another couple on the beach, he referred to one of my children as “our daughter.” Do we need to be married? I don’t know. Mostly, as my boyfriend likes to say, I want for nothing.But I needed that ring.The metal detector from the pawnshop was a jury-rigged piece of junk with duct tape holding the battery in place, an item I would have hauled to the dump days earlier. My friend turned it on and nothing happened.I was getting frantic, and cold. I left my girls and my friend to guard the snow while I drove to buy a new battery, and this time — another half-hour of daylight wasted — the metal detector beeped to life. The metal-detecting needle didn’t budge, but when we tested the machine by dropping a penny in the snow, it beeped again. The sun was lower, I was drained, but we had a heartbeat.It seemed impossible that this cheap hunk of plastic in my hand might produce a miracle, but I took slow steps into the field, sweeping it over the snow. A crowd had gathered: The skiers were back. My friend’s teenage son and his buddies had arrived. The kind runner had actually run home, showered and driven back to check on me, unable to shake how upset I had appeared.It didn’t even take long — 15 minutes? — before the detector beeped again. I remained skeptical; I figured it was picking up the metal zipper on my boot. But the faint beep persisted in one spot, and when I knelt down and poked my fingers into the snow, there was my ring.I burst into tears. I turned to show the crowd, mostly strangers. It felt a little weird to consider telling them the ring’s story, but by then they had invested their time, too.“My mom gave me this ring when I was 20,” I said. “She was diagnosed with cancer when she was 25 and told she had a year to live. She hadn’t even gone on a first date with my dad. When they got engaged, her doctor told them she might have five years. They went for it anyway and got married. On her 50th birthday, she threw a big party and refused presents. She gave me this ring on that day — three bands of gold, engraved with her name, my name, my dad’s. She died 18 years later. I’ve never taken it off.”Now a handful of strangers were crying.I spared them the surgery detail — that, in fact, I had taken off the ring for the first time the prior week. Before leaving for the hospital, I put it in a small box that I’d given my mother decades earlier and then taken back from her bookshelf after she died.More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: ‘20 Years in the Friend Zone’March 26, 2019A Third Ring, Bearing the Most Important TruthJan. 9, 2014I didn’t tell them how my boyfriend had taken me to surgery at the crack of dawn and waited with me, then filled my prescriptions, brought me home and tucked me into bed.

Or how, when he came to ask if there was anything I needed, I said, “Can you get me my ring?”I didn’t go into the fact that he and I aren’t married, or explain that I may like to get married again someday — but also that I want for nothing. Both are true.I didn’t recount how my boyfriend retrieved that box with its irreplaceable ring inside and came back to my room and handed it to me, or how I took the ring out and put it on my finger.It’s not a wedding ring, but I didn’t need to tell them that.Need is a funny word.Robin Troy, co-director of the Beargrass Writers Workshop in Missoula, Montana, is working on her third book.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

5c3a12733a125f5075c0413f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/opinion/sunday/2019-government-shutdown.html,"Monday, Jan. 75:30 a.m.It’s the first full day I am furloughed, but I’m not sleeping in. My wife goes to a hot yoga class on Monday and she gets up at 5:30 a.m. to get there on time. I get up then, too, because she needs every light on. 6:43 a.m.The kids are awake and I’m getting them ready for school. I have to dress the 5-year-old in his school uniform; help the 7-year-old find his school pullover — “not sweatshirt!”; there’s a big difference — and keep the 3-year-old from destroying whatever she comes into contact with. Usually I’m getting myself dressed, too. This morning, we’re discussing what type of language is appropriate to use at school when the 7-year-old asks, “Where’s your uniform, Daddy?” I tell him that I don’t have to wear it today, because I’m off work.“Is this like when you had jury duty?” he asks. I tell him this is different. “Are you fired?”“No, I’m furloughed,” I say.“That’s a new F-word!” he says. 10:17 a.m.I work at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, on the telecommunications support staff. Some of us from work are in a group chat together. Usually, we talk about sports and current events. Today, we are the current event.“Don’t watch the news,” someone says. We share advice on how to stay afloat while we’re not getting paid. Someone explains how to contact the mortgage company and request a month’s reprieve without incurring penalties; someone else describes how to contact utility companies.I chime in to say that I am watching a “Sopranos” marathon on HBO. I should be cleaning out the gutters, but instead I’m clearing out the DVR. Another co-worker says that I should cut the cord and get rid of cable. Well, I have some time to explore that option.Tuesday, Jan. 88 a.m.School drop-off is a success. I run to the grocery store afterward and pick up juice, pull-up diapers and fruit. I’m in and out and back home in 30 minutes — faster than it ever is. But usually I’m not grocery shopping at 8 a.m. on a Tuesday, I’m on my way to work. Traffic in D.C. always drops during the holidays, and returns full force the second week of January. Not this year.ImageA nearly empty train platform at the Cleveland Park Metro station in Washington during the shutdown.CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times10 a.m.A few of my neighbors ask if I’m affected by the shutdown. I say not yet. I’m off work, but my pockets are O.K. for now. Most of the museum staff is furloughed like me. But skeleton crews are still at work, some unpaid.The Matisse cutouts still have to be rotated in and out of light; the Van Gogh has to be guarded.We call the people doing this work “the Essentials.” That would be a great name for a band, I think. I imagine seeing that on iTunes. Then I think that if this goes on for much longer, I’ll cancel my Apple Music subscription.The first week of the shutdown, when we were still open, the museum got a call from someone who had tickets to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture that had been bought months in advance. The caller had Grandma come up from Georgia to see it, but the museum was closed when they arrived. The caller was glad that the National Gallery was open and had an exhibition of photographs by Gordon Parks to enjoy.The gallery was closed the next day.10:30 p.m.President Trump gave a speech on television saying that the shutdown is all about the “wall.” I remember that last month he tweeted that “most of the people not getting paid are Democrats.” When I heard that, I thought about how many of the federal workers in Washington are African-American, which I think might be how the president meant it to sound. Funny, we tend to see ourselves as American citizens who have a right to pursue happiness — which is kind of hard to do without a steady income. Wednesday, Jan. 96:30 a.m.My wife, Tracie, is getting ready to go to her job as a massage therapist. She started her business during the recession, when I was laid off from a nongovernment job. She usually works four days a week, but is adding extra hours during the furlough and thinking about adding an extra day.11 a.m.I pick up my mom and take her to get some medication. Her senior center had a field trip to the National Gallery scheduled for Monday. Now, of course, it’s canceled. Since there are no other free museums open, the whole outing is off. It’s probably for the best, my mom says. Another trip to the casino instead isn’t great for the group’s savings.2 p.m.I’m making decent progress on the DVR — 70 hours left. That’s a lot of TV. It probably is time to cut the cord.8:10 p.m.On stage at a comedy show, I talk about the furlough. Some of the audience is off work too. I say that I’m looking for a job that the president won’t shut down. What should I do?Pole dancing is suggested. No one really wants to see that, I say. A woman in front says that she does it and I ask if she’s hiring. It’s Saturday energy on a Wednesday.ImageA Henry Moore sculpture outside the National Gallery of Art, which is closed because of the shutdown.  CreditKevin Lamarque/ReutersThursday, Jan. 1010 a.m.After school drop-off, my wife and I have to check out a possible day care center for our youngest. We like the place and fill out the forms. We may be able to qualify for financial help while I’m out on furlough. I’d much rather be at work earning my keep, but to be honest the assistance would be nice.11:43 a.m.“Are we getting a paycheck?” That’s the talk on group chat today. It’s close to payday, so close to when we’ll really be noticing what the furlough costs. I don’t follow the advice to avoid the news, and I see the president walked out of a meeting with Democrats. It doesn’t seem as if we’re any closer to ending this. And we’re on track to break the shutdown record.10:30 p.m.My wife and I start watching a show on Hulu and we decide we’re going to cancel it soon. We’re thankful that we’re this fortunate — that the first things we need to give up are Hulu and Apple Music.Friday, Jan. 117:25 a.m.The 7-year-old asks if I want to go back to work.I tell him that I do very much want to go back to work.“Good,” he says.“Why?”“Because I like to visit,” he says.RelatedOpinion | The Editorial BoardThe Shutdown Is Now the Longest Ever.

5c9d989b49f0eacbf105fac7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/style/modern-love-race-i-broke-up-with-her-because-shes-white.html,"O.K., let me just get to it. I think I broke up with my last girlfriend because she’s white. Actually, no, I definitely broke up with her because she’s white.First, some history: When I was a child, watching my pops get ready to go out was something to behold. He would spend hours preparing his mask every morning for whatever crowd, person or community he faced. A fresh shave followed by a ton of cologne (he’s Dominican, and it’s important to him that people know he’s coming, and know he’s there), and then blow-drying his hair to get that perfect coif.Even years later, my pops still took longer to get ready than my mother and sister combined, delicately taking a black Sharpie to any stray grays that might pop up in his goatee.I’d ask him: Why? What’s it all for?My pops would explain that as a young man in the Dominican Republic, you had to work so hard perfecting yourself, preparing your mask, so that when a young European or American woman came through, she might choose you, as he would put it, might take you home with her, like that was your only way out. Later he made his way to New York City, where he met my mother, who is Colombian. He was married now and no longer had to be “chosen.” But habits ingrained in adolescence can be hard to break.So early on I learned how important it was to be “chosen,” selected. Selected by whom became and remains my dilemma.It’s been a year since I broke up with my girlfriend, and I haven’t told her the real reason. I talked around it, mumbling about how I was trying to figure out who I was or whatever. She didn’t understand. I’m not sure I do either. There was nothing wrong with her at all.I don’t really know what my tipping point was. It just kind of happened. At 30, I woke up one day, took a deep breath, looked at her and thought, “I don’t think I can date white women anymore.”Maybe I wouldn’t have broken up with her if it hadn’t been for all the judgment coming my way. Over the years I have dated brown women and black women, but mostly white women. I hadn’t thought about why that was, but when some brown and black people in my community started giving me a hard time about dating white women, I sensed they’d be happier if I stopped.I also got weird vibes from some white people, namely the parents of the women I was dating. Like the ones who — even after I’d been dating their daughter for six months — kept thinking I was from Puerto Rico. I’ve never even been to Puerto Rico.Or the ones who said upon meeting me, “Oh, I love ‘Buena Vista Social Club.’”Yeah, for sure, that’s a great movie, but so is “Gladiator.”And the ones who asked me if I speak Mexican. Yes, that is absolutely a thing. So is the father who opened the door and said, “Sorry, it’s not taco night,” and then closed it in my face, only to open it again because he was “just joking.”I’ve been with people in grocery stores who point to the dulce de leche and say, “Look, Chris, that’s you.” Actually, I’m lactose intolerant.But the real reason I think I can no longer date white women isn’t any of that. It’s because in today’s hashtag-woke society, there is mad pressure to be hashtag-woke. To be aware of the implications of whom you’re attracted to and why. Which means that in the eyes of others, the color of the women I date is a big deal. Like I’m the problem. Like I’m betraying my people if I date white women.But I was taught that we were all one people!I see people watching me with a stink eye, noses turned up, as if they think black and brown people would somehow be better off if I dumped my white girlfriend. It’s a lot of pressure. Along with each watchful eye, the whispers of, “Pick a side, Chris, pick a side,” fill my already noisy mind.I started reading James Baldwin, Ta-Nehisi Coates and other black and brown authors looking for guidance, a road map, help on what it means to be a brown man in the world. Like: Yes, our bodies have been colonized. Yes, I am a child of blackness. Yes, the black body has done more for society than it has gotten in return. Yes, society seems to want to embrace a lot of things associated with blackness without actually being black.How did we get here? If everyone is so woke, why are things so terrible? Maybe everyone isn’t so woke. Anyway, what am I supposed to do? How do I love as a brown body in the world in a way that makes everybody happy? I fell for a white woman and she fell for me — simple as that — yet I feel as if I’m doing the wrong thing by dating her.Am I the problem or is everyone else? Do white women find me attractive or do they see me as some exotic idea they should find attractive? Do I find white women attractive or do I see them as some exotic idea I should find attractive? Do I even know whom I’m attracted to or why?I have to think my preferences were at least somewhat shaped by the ubiquitous image of Latin men as “The Lover,” an image that’s been shoved down my throat. Not because of what or whom we love, but as a way out, a way of being seen and of being saved. Like my pops said, “Maybe they’ll choose you.”It’s a message amplified by movies and TV, from “Save the Last Dance” to “Master of None” and dozens of other narratives that all feature, in one way or another, a black or brown man being made better from being with a white woman.Since I was a child, I’ve internalized the idea that the hand I hold determines my worth more than my own hands. That my power is only as valuable as the person by my side. A whole system is coded within me. Why wasn’t self-worth coded within me?Before I was born, my mother told my father she was pregnant at 3 a.m. on a New York City subway platform. She and my pops made a commitment to give us children everything they never had, to strive and achieve and provide for us, and in response to their aspiration, some in their world thought they were leaving their roots behind and trying to become something else. Those folks said to them, “You trying to be white now?”What does that mean — trying to be white? We’ve all heard it (maybe not all of us). I’ve said it. If we think about it, it’s really just a comment on power: “Chico, you trying to have power now?”Yes, yes I am.In truth, colorism has always been a thing. An aspiration to “better the race” has always been a thing. My grandmother and other grandmothers and mothers would warn us: “Don’t date someone darker than you. Don’t date coarse hair, big lips and big noses.”I brought home a black girl in high school and my aunt angrily mumbled, “Oh, do you see him and that Negrita?”I should have spoken up. “Ay, yo, stop! I don’t care about your damn opinions about how dark people are and how kinky their hair is. You ever look at old family albums? You ever look at me? You ever look at yourself? We ain’t white. Not even close.”But I didn’t say anything. (“Pick a side, Chris, pick a side.”)More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: ‘Relationships Are Like Shoes’March 19, 2019Who’s Allowed to Hold Hands?Sept. 1, 2017So here I stand, trying to be woke, and not dating white women, and feeling kind of bad about that. Because I’m definitely dating, and thinking that the decision to no longer date white women might not be my own, that any decision to choose a side doesn’t help the whole hashtag-woke thing because how do we solve anything if we just separate and isolate? And also, I mean, a lot of white women are really cool.Obviously white women are cool. All women are cool. Cool is such a simple word, not the word I want to be using right now. I don’t just mean cool. (I probably shouldn’t even be talking about dating or not dating white women. Ah, man, this isn’t going where I wanted it to — )Anyway, this is me yearning, praying, journaling, writing, dialoguing, putting up a one-man show, wishing, trying to pick a side, wondering how to choose myself and trying to wrap my head around this, hoping that I’m doing woke right, because something just doesn’t feel right.Christopher Rivas is a storyteller, actor and the creator of ""The Real James Bond Was Dominican!""Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

But while Hargrove, who died at age 49 late last year, remained deeply rooted in jazz, he also anticipated the contemporary landscape of blurred musical genres, through his leadership of the electroacoustic ensemble the RH Factor and collaborations with D’Angelo, Erykah Badu and Common.Fittingly, given this dual legacy, the trumpeter’s contributions are being honored both uptown and down. On Tuesday, more than 40 artists will celebrate his life during a star-studded free concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. And on Saturday, the Roots’ James Poyser will lead a tribute at Bowery Ballroom as part of the Winter Jazzfest marathon that will also feature the vocalist Bilal, as well as members of Hargrove’s quintet. NATALIE WEINERDance: Caleb Teicher Makes Noise at the GuggenheimJan. 6-7, worksandprocess.org.The tap dancer and choreographer Caleb Teicher is on a roll. His exuberant “Bzzz,” a sonically sophisticated collaboration with the beat boxer Chris Celiz, was a hit at New York City Center’s Fall for Dance festival in October. And his latest work, “More Forever,” drew critical acclaim after its recent preview at the Guggenheim Museum’s Works & Process series.Created with the pianist and composer Conrad Tao, “More Forever” now returns to the Guggenheim for its official premiere. With his free-spirited warmth and impeccable rhythm, Teicher first garnered attention as a dancer with the celebrated tap artist Michelle Dorrance. In works for his own ensemble, Caleb Teicher & Co., he shares her knack for percussive invention and moving bodies through space in eye-catching ways. To Tao’s score for piano and electronics, “More Forever” experiments with sources of sound, exploring American dance traditions like tap, jazz and Lindy Hop on a sand-covered stage. SIOBHAN BURKEClassical: Experimental Opera at the Prototype FestivalJan. 6-12; prototypefestival.org.The Prototype Festival, held each January, is a proving ground for audacious new opera and music theater. Overseen by Beth Morrison Projects and the theater collective Here, the 12 works put on by Prototype this week unfold across New York and explore themes as varied as clinical depression, family ties, capital punishment and the legacy of Pancho Villa.Among such intense offerings, one highlight is “prism,” composed by Ellen Reid, with a libretto by Roxie Perkins and direction by James Darrah. Staged at La MaMa in Manhattan, “prism” is Reid’s first opera, but her well-wrought music has been engaging with smart dramatic ideas for some time: She wrote a few of the most compelling scenes in “Hopscotch,” the car-based experimental opera that sprawled across Los Angeles in 2015. When “prism,” a harrowing examination of the aftermath of sexual assault, debuted last November, The Los Angeles Times declared that “Reid, in a word, has arrived.” WILLIAM ROBINTV: ‘Fosters’ Sisters Grow Up in ‘Good Trouble’Jan. 8; freeform.com.Freeform knows that a girl’s got to take flight sometime. The network welcomed Yara Shahidi into its world with “grown-ish,” which followed her character, the too-cool-for-school Zoey Johnson from ABC’s “black-ish,” as she stumbled through life as a college freshman. (Season 2, in which Zoey is determined to make her sophomore “sequel” better, began Jan. 2.)Now Freeform is spinning off two characters of its own: Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana (Cierra Ramirez), part of the adopted clan at the heart of “The Fosters,” which ended in June (and offered a glimpse of the future with a series of flash-forwards). Their new series, “Good Trouble,” starting Tuesday, Jan. 8, picks up five years later in Los Angeles, where Callie, a recent law-school graduate, is clerking for a conservative judge, and Mariana has entered the male-dominated tech world. Together, they’ve landed the kind of dilapidated apartment with fabulous bones known only to first-time renters in Televisionland. Which could mean roommates. The more, the un-merrier.Like “The Fosters,” “Good Trouble” comes from Jennifer Lopez’s Nuyorican production company. And Jon M. Chu (“Crazy Rich Asians”) directed the pilot. KATHRYN SHATTUCKImage“Stag Amidst Autumn Flowers”CreditMori Sosen/The Metropolitan Museum of ArtArt: Nature and Experimentation in Japanese PaintingThrough Jan. 21; metmuseum.org.Between the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and the 1868 Meiji Restoration, Japan was unified and at peace under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Popular arts flourished, and, though the country was officially closed for most of the period, foreign influences did trickle in. “The Poetry of Nature: Edo Paintings from the Fishbein-Bender Collection,” which you can catch for just a few more weeks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, offers two ink paintings by Mori Sosen that are inflected with Western anatomical realism to mesmerizing effect. Ghostly black and white feathers in “Silkies” make seven chickens look as if they’re trembling, and the evanescent “Stag Amidst Autumn Flowers” is a delicate creature pinned in place by pointy leaves. WILL HEINRICHImageMarin Ireland CreditFrederick M. Brown/Getty ImagesTheater: Justified Female Fury in ‘Blue Ridge’Through Jan. 26, atlantictheater.org.Cathartic though it was, taking an ax to the principal’s car was not the wisest expression of rage. But it’s the one that Alison chose, and in the sprawling new play “Blue Ridge” — written by Abby Rosebrock (“Dido of Idaho”) and directed by Taibi Magar (“Is God Is”) — her violence has landed her in a halfway house somewhere in southern Appalachia.Played by Marin Ireland, a masterly portrayer of tough and troubled women (“Ironbound,” “Kill Floor”), Alison is a likable mess of an English teacher trying to piece her life back together. Her destructive romance with the principal, her boss, endowed her with a sharply tuned radar for exploitative men, and she has zero tolerance when she senses a predator in the group home.A tragicomic ensemble piece that makes some vivid insights into sexual degradation, calculated abuse of power and justified female fury, “Blue Ridge” is in previews for an opening on Monday, Jan. 7, at Atlantic Theater Company in Manhattan. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHESImage“Grave of the Fireflies”CreditShinchosha CompanyFilm: A Takahata Masterpiece Debuts in New YorkJan. 4; quadcinema.com.In 1985, the Japanese filmmakers Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki founded the now-iconic Studio Ghibli, creating dreamy fairy tales like “Ponyo,” “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away,” the last of which won an Oscar for best animated feature in 2003 after Disney released an English version.Miyazaki, who wrote and directed each of those films, grew to international acclaim. But the less prolific of the two, Takahata, who died in April, claimed his own legion of admirers with “Grave of the Fireflies” (1988). Its animation innocent (the light from those fireflies!) and message heart-rending, the haunting tale — based on a semi-autobiographical story by Akiyuki Nosaka — follows a teenage boy and his younger sister as they try to survive the firebombing of Japan by American forces during World War II.On Friday, Jan. 4, the Quad Cinema is giving Takahata’s masterpiece its New York theatrical premiere. Those unable to savor the experience on the big screen can find “Grave of the Fireflies” on iTunes. KATHRYN SHATTUCK"

Perversely, I had picked this place because it was farm-to-table and my ex-boyfriend had told me at some point that his new girlfriend liked locally sourced food. Perhaps I had overdressed.She arrived, smiling nervously, her cheeks pink from the cold or too much blush. Like me, she had worn a knee-length, woven skirt.

The Modern Love college essay contest began on February 15 and ends on March 24. For information, go to nytimes.com/essaycontest.Though I had seen her around, I mostly knew my ex’s new girlfriend through the ephemera she left in his car: oversize black sunglasses, tinted lip balm, stretched hair ties. After some small talk, I got to the heart of the matter: I said her boyfriend was stopping by my apartment on his way to work, something he’d been doing ever since I moved out several months before.After our breakup, I took an apartment near our old place, wanting to work things out. Though we decided to date other people, we fell into old habits, and he started leaving cute notes on my car, written on the back of valet stubs and tucked under the windshield wiper.When I told his girlfriend about the notes, she said, with a pained smile, “That’s romantic.”“No,” I said. It was controlling.I had believed in the romantic gesture, the aggressive wooing through copious gifts, fancy dinners and handwritten letters, all of which heightened my sense that we were in love.I was only beginning to understand the insidious side of romance, how his recent notes and morning visits were less about wooing me than checking up on me, less about generosity than possession. Every morning, whether or not we met up, he would drive past to see if my car was parked in front of my apartment. When it wasn’t, he would later accuse me of having slept somewhere else.And the notes with a simple “hi” or the red inked hearts? These, too, were reminders that he was watching.This was not the conversation I had intended to have with her. I had just wanted to tell her that her boyfriend was cheating, because when he was my boyfriend and cheating, no one had told me.Naïvely, I had hoped things might have been different otherwise. But I didn’t just want to leave her burdened by that knowledge. I wanted to give her an opportunity to relieve herself of its weight.“Actually,” she said, and then she went on to tell me he had been showing up outside of places where she was hanging out, even when she hadn’t mentioned where she would be.What I wish I had said is that those kinds of romantic gestures are a trap. Instead, she and I took our unfinished puzzle and put away the pieces. We paid the check. I told her to call me sometime. We hugged.Romance, I have since learned, isn’t just a sleight of hand that can make you see something that isn’t there. A belief in that kind of romance can also be a distraction. Years later, I almost didn’t see the man who would become my husband.We met on Valentine’s Day (of all days), though I wasn’t doing anything to celebrate it. I had just had dinner with a friend and we decided to dip into a warm bar. Inside, the bartender informed us the bar was hosting a singles night. She held out numbered stickers, the kind they give you on the first day of kindergarten, and we reluctantly affixed them to our sweaters.The idea was for patrons to send each other Valentines using the numbers instead of giving up their names. It also flagged how long everyone had been at the bar. My number was 62.My friend and I ordered beers. Five minutes later, a shirtless man with sagging brown corduroys and a pair of children’s fairy wings strapped to his back tapped me on the shoulder.“Uh, this guy at the end of the bar wanted me to give this to you,” he said, handing me a note. It was in French.I looked over at the man, who raised his glass at me. He had the droopy leer of someone who had been drinking for a while. His tag read “1.”I waved, shrugged and said, “I don’t read French!”“He’s cute, no?” said the guy with the fairy wings, who, lacking his own tag, seemed to be playing Cupid. “He wants to buy you a drink,” he added.As he walked away, my friend jagged her thumb at Cupid and said, “I think he likes you.” I looked again at his thin body and corduroys and shrugged. After our single drink, my friend and I went home.The next night, we ended up at the same bar. This time her ex-boyfriend joined us. I was mostly there for support. Amid their tart exchanges, I saw Cupid again, now wingless, wearing beat-up Sperrys and skinny jeans. He sidled up on the bar stool beside me and started asking questions, as if he were tapping around a wall looking for a hollow where he might put in a door.The conversation grew intimate, and I began to recount my ex-boyfriend woes. He told me about his ex-girlfriend, who had cheated on him while she was in rehab. She had a habit, he said, of pushing him out to sea and then reeling him in when she felt lonely.As the bar was closing, he flashed me a puckish smile and invited me back to his place to “make out and snuggle.”Our clothes came off quickly. Staring up at him while we were having sex, a nervous itch came over me. Afterward, he asked me to sleep over and promised to make eggs and bagels in the morning.I smiled and said, “Sure.”Instead, I woke up when the sky was still black and slipped out with my boots in hand so as not to wake him. Outside, I was surrounded by old warehouses and leering industrial machinery. I followed the horizon back to my apartment and slid into bed as the sun came up.For the next few days I avoided the bar where Cupid and I met. I was ambivalent about our tryst and feeling fragile about where it might lead.When my ex and I first met, our eyes locked across a crowded cafeteria. It was teen movie magic. He cracked a joke, I laughed; we started hanging out. He kept me hooked with chivalrous gestures like picking me up from work when I could have just as well walked home. But our relationship was toxic. How could I trust my instincts after that? Were they even my own?A few days later, I ended up back at the bar, and there was my Cupid. This time we went back to my place. I told him I had to walk my dog.More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: ‘We Sometimes Pretend We Are Strangers’March 12, 2019When Your Body Tells You What Your Brain Won’tFeb. 2, 2018We slipped off our clothes and got into bed, our bodies entwined.

5c9540f249f0eacbf105e913,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/multimedia/netflix-apple-tv-streaming.html,"Apple and Netflix, for better and for worse, have changed how we spend our leisure hours. In the process, the two companies have upended old media habits and created new ones. Apple’s iPhones have already ported over big portions of people’s brains, and Netflix exploded TV time slots, creating the binge and the endless content screen. Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like “Terrace House” and a Brechtian, mind-bending drama like “Russian Doll” in one place?While setting the standard in their chosen areas, Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past, for the most part. But that period of peace between the two tech giants is about to change.On Monday, Apple will unveil its most ambitious media project yet — a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, original shows and films. And when a tech giant like Apple jumps into entertainment, it’s going to create waves.Apple revealed the new products at an event in Cupertino, Calif. on Monday. Read about it here:Apple Unveils Video Service With Celebrity Parade but Few DetailsThe iPhone maker is partnering with Hollywood heavyweights and publishers to provide broad new services to its users.March 25, 2019Famous for its teasing product demonstrations, Apple will play host to Hollywood at its Cupertino, Calif., campus so that it can show off what Reese Witherspoon, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg (he of the recent Netflix-films-should-not-get-Oscars argument) have done with the more than $1 billion the company has laid out for its new ambitions.The amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the $10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than a billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix.The cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple’s iTunes store.Apple had been charging Netflix 15 percent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store. Now, new subscribers can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device, but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment details. (In the wonky world of internet transactions, where you make the purchase determines how, or if, Apple gets a cut.)In a second sign of frayed relations between the two companies, Netflix has decided to opt out of the Apple bundle, which will upsell subscriptions to HBO and CBS in addition to its original programming. Netflix’s absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed.Mr. Hastings explained it at a Netflix event earlier this week: “Apple’s a great company. We want to have people watch our service — or our content on our service. And so we’ve chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.”The key word here is “service.”Put it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company’s identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up “Stranger Things” or “Orange Is the New Black” may not be aware that they’re watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data.Apple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video — what television is fast becoming — and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers.The focus on Apple’s programming makes for a tantalizing narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, like the program set at a morning show starring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetizer. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple’s shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller.But Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many “originals,” it doesn’t actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. “House of Cards” and “The Crown,” to cite two examples, are licensed.Netflix’s programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn’t a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that’s by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn’t about any particular aesthetic, like HBO’s. It’s a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller “You” to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show “1983.”The same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels — like HBO or CBS — within their platforms.Not coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast’s broadband service can spend an extra $5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It’s meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing.A nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast — a competing distributor — and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorized to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of.Netflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has 97 million, but not all are watching its videos.Their reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly.It also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple’s service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet.Still, HBO’s inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service — which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like “Wonder Woman” and “Friends” — by the end of the year.From HBO’s perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple’s streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It’s just another sales outlet. Even HBO’s own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to five million. (HBO currently has more than seven million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.)But that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T’s own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros.) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle?It’s worth noting that Apple is hyping its new service at a time when sales of its most lucrative product, the iPhone, have started to lag. It stopped reporting how many devices it sold as of September. Now, it wants investors to look at another line item — its foray into the media business, which is stable and steadily growing. Apple hopes it will grow even faster with the help of Hollywood.Interestingly, that line item (listed as “Services” on the Apple income statement) was once little more than a balance-sheet curiosity. Now, it’s a $40 billion business. The forthcoming bundle could add more than $12 billion to that, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs.For comparison, the entirety of the Walt Disney Company generated $59 billion in sales last year. CBS, $14 billion. Netflix, $16 billion.Without explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus.So what does mean for everyone else?Mr. Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: “The game is on.”"

He fixes a lot. He’s smart but socially awkward, able to name obscure bones in the human body but unable to keep his foot out of his mouth — a grown man with perpetually scraped knees. I have no idea how he manages to injure himself so regularly. Maybe his skin is fragile.I had known him casually for a few years when I called one day to ask for help with an apparent rodent infestation; I had something living in my walls. It was a long shot, summoning an acquaintance for such a favor, but I felt overwhelmed and he seemed like the kind of guy who could handle it.Twenty minutes later he appeared at my door in painting overalls and rain boots, carrying traps, gloves, a bucket and some jangly homemade contraption that kept undulating out of his backpack even as he stood still. A bead of sweat dropped from his disheveled hair into the crevice of an earnest grin. He reminded me of a Ghostbuster.College Essay ContestWe’re looking for a few new voices. Maybe yours? The Modern Love college essay contest began on February 15 and ends on March 24. For information, go to nytimes.com/essaycontest.I did not expect him to spend the night, but I was in the throes of third week pneumonia, and as my weary head nestled into the couch, I heard the rodent in the wall directly behind me, chewing. As the warmth drained from my body, I muscled open my eyes, scanning the room for my knight in shining armor.And there he was, balancing precariously on a chair like a circus elephant, using a fork to pry open a light fixture in the ceiling. He had my favorite hair brush in his hand, about to angle it into some unspeakable hole for non-grooming purposes. His methods were horrifying, but I was grateful for the help and the company. I didn’t ask him to leave.The trap in the ceiling went off several times during the night, like a pistol fired in an empty chapel, the unholy racket magnified by the oddly magnificent acoustics. Each time, as I lurched forward out of my cough medicine stupor, I felt a warm, comforting hand on my arm.“Don’t worry,” he would say. “Go back to sleep. I’ll take care of it.”Later, I would learn that taking care of it required just one utensil, the fork, which he would use to remove the dead mouse and then dip back into my organic peanut butter to apply more bait. Kitchen hygiene would become a regular topic of discussion in the months ahead.When he cooks on my stove, he chucks aside the burners and chars directly on the gas, to obsidian and beyond, saying it reminds him of camping. One day, I heard what sounded like a murder and found him on the kitchen floor, ripping the handles off a perfectly good pot to “make it smaller.” When I mused about possibly getting rid of a chair, he grabbed it, bent it over his knee and snapped it in half.My genie suffers from a frustrating condition known as premature wish-granting. That, and a proclivity for collateral damage.He shredded my broom trying to fish something out from under the refrigerator, put a hole in the wall going after a spider, mangled multiple appliances and hung ridiculously crooked curtain rods, twice. He’s a problem solver, not a perfectionist. My Ikea furniture projects made him livid. He would curse and flail and break at least one vital piece in a fit of rage, but he always managed to improvise and finish the job.My darling is an open book, a straight shooter. He tried lying a few times about little things and gave himself away with an adorable cheeky-toothed grin, as if it was his first day of kindergarten. I never have to question his love, even in the worst of times.He’s a prolific chef. Not everything tastes good, but he’s constantly placing giant, steaming bowls of food before me with all the charm and ambiguity of macaroni art. (“What did you make, honey? A smoky porridge? Oh, lasagna. Right. Yes. Of course.”)They are gifts at the feet of the deity, treating me as if I am his goddess. In the beginning, we played our roles with a bit of tongue in cheek, but at some point the sheer make-believe wore thin, leaving just earnest adoration.And I adore him. If I’m having a bad day I can just touch his warm skin and feel better. It’s some kind of heavenly temperature. He lets me rake his hair like a Zen garden, ad infinitum. With me, he’s infinitely patient.He always has time for the scenic route. He took me to the forest to watch shooting stars, the desert to see the super bloom. We bicycled down thrilling back roads in the dead of night and walked the beach in the rain. He would lip sync through long country songs, two inches from my face, so he could cry through his favorite parts while holding my hand. Never mind that I was in the middle of brushing my teeth. The more I foamed at the mouth, the more he wanted to kiss it.His solutions are simple but brilliant. If I am cranky at the end of a long day, he picks me up, plops me into bed, tucks me in and switches off the lights. Problem solved.Still, other problems have lingered. There’s a fine line between opposites attract and intractable differences. We have a love story, but love isn’t enough for me, and I do feel uneasy admitting that.When I was younger, I believed the holy grail of romance was the birth of love. But now I have seen that love is the easy part; love will come again and again, as many times as you allow it. And then what? What about all the other details?We disagree on how to treat people, where to spend money, what it means to explore the world. I’m a low-key creature who burns sage and collects Craigslist art. He’s an eye-for-an-eye vigilante who keeps a gun. His logical mind is razor-keen; mine is more inclined to imagery and approximation. I think he would be an excellent father, but I can’t imagine us having children together. On the verge of 37, I do think about it.I broke up with him on Labor Day, right before the full moon. I had woken up crying and realized after a few hours that I wouldn’t be able to stop until I let him go. When my gut takes over, I can turn into a beast. I knew I had to do this but didn’t know how.How do you break up with someone you like being around but don’t see a future with? I should add that, along with our other differences, he’s much older than I am. We don’t make sense, or at least I can’t make sense of us.At a loss for how to break up with him, I sought out instructions on wikiHow. I skimmed a few articles and caught the main points. Go to a private place in case he falls apart. Be honest and direct. Keep it brief. One woman says she bakes cookies for her soon-to-be-exes, the Betty Crocker kiss of death. I brought him sweet cherries and his contact lens solution.More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: ‘Would We Ever Be Together Again?’March 5, 2019The 12-Hour Goodbye That Started EverythingJuly 21, 2017I did not tell him why I was coming to his house, but I think he knew. He had figured out early on that he couldn’t read my mind so he learned to read my heart instead. He set up two chairs facing each other and did this perfectly sweet thing where he holds my legs and gazes into my eyes. He listened for a long time before he broke.His first tear dropped like a pin. “Let’s go to Vegas and get married tonight,” he said. “I’ll drive all night and have you back by morning.”I said: “Don’t hijack this conversation with a marriage proposal.”His leaden forearms were leaning into my car window when I backed out of his driveway. As I pushed them away, I felt the sublime warmth of his fragile skin seeping into my body.He must have sensed my uncertainty, because a few weeks later he showed up to plead his case. I told myself I would only allow him to stay for an hour, but we ended up in each other’s arms and I lost track of time. I still haven’t asked him to leave.Sometimes I wonder if relationships are like math problems: You add the pros, subtract the cons, run the numbers and round up to the nearest husband. I have never been good at math, but I keep puzzling over this equation, trying to reconcile whether love for us is greater than, or less than, doubt.Nasreen Yazdani is a comedy writer based in San Diego.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

5c89793549f0eacbf105ceaa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/elizabeth-warren-tech-companies.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation — besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters — was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways.The first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other — sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace — but not both.“You can be an umpire or you can own teams,” she said. “But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game.”Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials.But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.Ms. Warren’s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I’d offer a few edits.Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren’s plan — and it’s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules — is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.Lawmakers don’t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That’s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.Instead, Ms. Warren’s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces — a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google — and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google’s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn’t giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies — each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own — gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse.For example, let’s imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company’s streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix’s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon’s streaming-video team should copy.To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon’s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address.An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.Get rid of the “app tax.” Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the “Apple tax”: a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google’s mobile app store charges similar fees.)These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms’ strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple’s App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.Don’t get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren’s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook’s ability to “shut down a debate” over its power.The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook’s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be “Facebook’s official quiz game” or whatever.But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.“She’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,” Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter.One problem with the debate over the tech companies’ power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook’s shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz’s unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for “neutral platforms.”The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies’ power, while leaving their fortresses intact."
5c82111e49f0eacbf105bfe8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/style/modern-love-infidelity-husband-leave-me-alone.html,"I was tossed back into the online dating pool by a Facebook message that arrived on the first day of a family vacation with my partner, David, and our young son. After a frantic morning of preparation, we were filling the car with gas, headed to the beach, when I settled in to check messages.One from an unfamiliar name stood out, a simple command: “Tell your husband to leave me alone.”I felt struck by cognitive dissonance: I did not recognize this man’s name, nor were David and I married. Was this a mistake?Then it dawned on me. I felt the chill of cortisol spreading through my body from a point between my ears, my worst fear being realized, just starting our vacation with our son in the back seat.College Essay ContestWe’re looking for a few new voices. Maybe yours? The Modern Love college essay contest began on February 15 and ends on March 24. For information, go to nytimes.com/essaycontest.The message was from a woman whose nickname is also a man’s name, and she told me that she and David had been having a mostly online affair after meeting at an out-of-state convention nearly two years earlier. Something had clearly upset their relationship, prompting her audacious message.When David got behind the wheel, I silently handed him my phone.He froze as he read the words. “It’s not as bad as it looks,” he said quietly.No. It’s usually worse.I know, because I said the same thing 15 years earlier to the man I was committed to at the time. I had cheated on him and then, worse, tried to deny it. To this day, he understandably wants nothing to do with me and he remains the only important person from my past with whom I have no contact. Yet his silent judgment of me pales in comparison to the punishment I administered to myself for being a selfish, weak person who hurt another. It took me a long time to forgive myself.David and I tried counseling, but, for me, any small bits of traction we gained each time were gone by the following day. After one particularly clarifying realization that our efforts were futile, I let go of the fantasy of staying together just so our son could have two parents in one home, and instead I focused on a plan for the dissolution of our relationship.David seemed confused by my refusal to walk back the threats we had made, which was what I had often done in the past. Then he began dating with a vengeance, as if replacement were his only goal. Within a month, he was dating someone exclusively.Not long after, I decided to try dating again after an 11-year break. Technology had changed so much, and I was curious to see what it was like to go from websites with clunky messaging systems to smartphone apps requiring just the swipe of a finger. Yet the premise remained the same: We were browsing a human library, judging the books by their covers.I decided my only expectation would be to meet new people. I had no desire to find a long-term partner. I wanted to have fun and I wanted attention — male, sexual attention, which had been missing since our son was born.Soon enough I connected with a man, and our communication quickly turned sexual, despite my saying I wasn’t interested in virtual sex.Jens said he lived in Norway, had been separated for six months, traveled a lot for work and was in my area every two months or so. He was here right now, in fact, and he wanted to meet. But I wasn’t available, and he had to fly out.We stayed in touch, and soon photos and lascivious flirtations were streaming back and forth. He told me I was beautiful, attractive, desirable — things I hadn’t heard in years. It didn’t matter that we were typically 4,000 miles apart; the distance and the anticipation worked in tandem to magnify the desire.I often would hear from him around dinnertime, which was his bedtime. More than once I found myself texting racy thoughts while putting a pot of pasta on the stove. His thing about visiting every two months became a joke to us as the two months stretched to three, then four. Finally, he sent a text saying he would be visiting in a week.“Really??” I texted.“Really really,” he replied.After he arrived, his proximity fired up the sexual tension. He would be in town for three nights. The first night he had a work dinner, the second we were supposed to get together but he canceled without a reason, and the third he also canceled, without an excuse: “I’m sorry, but I can’t meet you. I can’t explain why. I’m so sorry.”I was stunned yet also surprised that I could feel crushed by someone I had never physically met. When you’ve shared so much intimacy online, does a physical presence become superfluous?Parsing the situation with a friend, we leaned toward the wife as an explanation.“Maybe he lied about being separated,” she said. “You know most men online are married.”“Possibly. Probably,” I said. I had decided early on that I would default to believing what men told me unless or until I had a reason not to. The alternative — assume everyone is lying — didn’t seem like a positive attitude when embarking on such a personal journey.“If they choose to lie, that’s on them,” I said to my friend. I’m fairly certain she thought me a fool, but she refrained from saying so.Communication with Jens dropped off to nearly nothing. A couple of “How are you?” texts punctuated weeks of silence. To one of them I replied, “Where are you?”“In the U.S.,” he said.“Really.”“Really really.”“Are you going to ask me out?”“I will,” he said.“Are you ready to tell me what happened?”“Not yet.”But he didn’t ask me out. We chatted over text but I was tentative, drawing a line so it wouldn’t become sexual or even flirtatious. I’d had a couple of promising dates with a sweet man named Marc, yet it was still so new and fragile. I feared Jens had the ability to sweep him out of my head, and I wanted to give Marc a chance. Jens left town without us meeting.He texted a month later to tell me he would be returning soon on what was likely his last United States trip for a long time; his company was focusing on other markets. And he was ready to explain why he had canceled on me.He had indeed still been married, and his wife had learned of his online exploits around the same time we were supposed to meet, hence the cryptic cancellation. They tried to reconcile but were unsuccessful.“That’s unsurprising,” I said. “The fact that you were still communicating with me suggests your heart wasn’t exactly in it.”Maybe not, he admitted, but now he was free. And ready to meet me.I was conflicted. I was still seeing Marc, happily so, but I was unsure of where it was going. My friends couldn’t understand why I would even consider meeting a person who had lied to me, who was willing to cheat on his wife with me.“I feel like we have unfinished business,” I said. Eight months had passed since Jens and I first texted. I knew it could go nowhere, but I was curious to meet the person whose attention had buoyed me during difficult times.More important, I realized that when I had finally decided to forgive myself for cheating on a partner 15 years earlier, that forgiveness came with an added responsibility: I must forgive everyone who has ever been unfaithful, because to judge others for something I had done would be the height of hypocrisy.More Modern LoveTiny Love Stories: Australia EditionFeb. 26, 2019What Sleeping With Married Men Taught Me About InfidelityApril 6, 2018In the Waiting Room of Estranged SpousesMarch 11, 2016Which is why I forgave David, too. I know why he sought attention from other women because I had been there, in a similar place, frustrated yet feeling as if there were no other way to keep the life I thought I wanted while exploring the excitement I knew was missing. I understand it. The fear, the passion, the risk and the excitement. I understand all of it.Understanding someone’s bad behavior is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that understanding precludes judgment. The downside is that I sometimes find myself defending people who have acted shamefully. But to remain righteously indignant of others takes more energy and is far more caustic to one’s soul, a price I’m not willing to pay.I did not meet Jens during his last trip. Marc and I had a turning point in our relationship — we had been seeing each other casually, but then he deleted his Tinder profile for me. With that in mind, meeting Jens would have made me feel dishonorable. Marc deserved the best me there is. So I texted Jens one last time to say goodbye, and then deleted our entire text history with the swipe of a finger.Karen Loeschner is a research analyst in Washington D.C.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.To hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.

I decided to apply this to my search for love, so I made a list only a 22-year-old could make. I wanted the man of my dreams to be:1. Taller than me (I’m 6-foot-2, so it’s a big ask)2. Dark-haired3. Fit, kind and funny (but not too funny because that was my job)4. Social but not too social (I didn’t want to compete for attention)5. CreativeLater that day I was on my way to the laundromat when I saw Todd. We had acted together in a Westchester Broadway Dinner Theater production of “Grease.” He was Danny Zuko. I was Doody.He looked even more beautiful than I remembered. Except for being 12 years older and straight, he was exactly what I wanted. He was even two inches taller than I was.“I just moved into the building next door,” he said.I tried not to swallow my tongue.Todd said he’d heard about my father dying and felt terrible about not calling. I knew he had gotten divorced, yet I hadn’t called either.College Essay ContestWe’re looking for a few new voices. Maybe yours? The Modern Love college essay contest began on February 15 and ends on March 24. For information, go to nytimes.com/essaycontest.In trying to comfort him about not comforting me, I actually said, “Oh, it’s O.K.!” about my own dead father. I was really nailing this interaction.“You want to have dinner and catch up?” he said.“Yes!” I practically floated to the laundromat. I knew this wasn’t a date, but I was still excited.We picked a Greek place and ordered gyros and beer. I didn’t drink beer, but beer seemed appropriate for my non-date date with this straight guy. We talked about my father’s funeral, and I really opened up to him. Maybe because it wasn’t a date.“It’s been a crazy couple of months,” he said. “After my divorce I really had to think about what had gone wrong with my marriage.”I zoned out for most of Todd’s speech because I was watching his lips move and his pecs jump, but I became laser-focused when he said, “I realized I’m gay. So I wanted to tell you that, Andrew. I’m gay.”You know those moments when time stands still? Like when you drive off a cliff or see your baby for the first time? (Neither of which I’ve experienced, but you know what I mean.) That’s what this felt like.Eventually I said something supportive about being honored that he chose to tell me. Then we moved on.I knew from my own coming out that it didn’t mean you wanted to belabor it, so I followed Todd’s lead, and the rest of the dinner was professional chitchat. We walked to our apartments, hugged awkwardly and then I went inside in a daze of anxiety and lust.And then I wondered: Did I just blow it? Had we actually been on a date? The only thing to do was go back and ask.Moments later, facing a shirtless Todd in his doorway, I said, “Were we just on a date?”He smiled. “Get in here.”I did as told and we proceeded to have the greatest sex I’d ever had in my life. I fell asleep in his arms and woke up that way. It was the first time I had slept through the night since my father died. Todd made me feel safe. And I made him feel safe. He was just out of the closet and here he had a man, albeit a young man, who was mad for him. It must have felt like he was dating a puppy.That night began what I considered to be my first adult relationship. The intensity of my attraction also created an insecurity and mania in me that nearly destroyed us several times. I was both Sid and Nancy in the way I needed him and hated him for it. It wasn’t healthy, but it was exciting. And what did I know about relationships? All I had heard was they were a lot of work. And we were definitely working.Shortly after Todd and I started dating, we were both given auditions for the new Broadway production of “Hairspray.” The show already had been cast, but at the last minute they needed a new men’s chorus member.Although I loved Todd, I was out for blood at that audition. And I killed it. Todd did too, because we both got to the final four. We left in silence, imagining the launch of our new Broadway careers (at the other’s expense).Two hours later we got our rejection calls. Todd was disappointed, but I was devastated. I was cheesy, white and could Pony my butt off. If I couldn’t land this job, how did I belong in this business?I didn’t belong in it, apparently.So I quit. I had been paying my bills with a day job — bland, pseudo-artistic work directing cartoons. Todd and I created a comfortable routine, going to farmer’s markets and flea markets, basically any kind of market, just to pass the time. There were weekend trips upstate and home repair projects.The first time we broke up, we were on a cruise with another gay couple. We got into an argument because he “made me feel stupid” for ordering Riesling at dinner. This spiraled into a larger conversation about me feeling controlled and Todd feeling that I ignored him when we were out with friends.The doors to the balcony were open and we could hear mariachis playing covers of pop songs. Our relationship ended during “La Bamba” when Todd shouted, “I don’t want to do this anymore!” just as the final note played.This was midway through the cruise, with three more ports to go. We barely spoke.Back home, though, we soon returned to our work and market-going and daily sex. And in this way, years passed.Until one day, while completing yet another mindless but stressful office task, I thought, “I can’t do this anymore.” I had to give acting one last shot.I managed to get a few minor jobs. Then one morning I got a call offering a Broadway audition. For “Hairspray,” of all shows. It was the exact role I had auditioned for years earlier.I couldn’t do it. The pain and disappointment was just too much to bear. That show was my John Waters-shaped white whale, taunting me. But I also couldn’t not do it.I didn’t tell Todd. He hadn’t been called in and I didn’t want to upset him. Also, I didn’t want to be embarrassed when I didn’t get it again.When the time came, I was totally relaxed and did the material exactly as I wanted to. By the time I got back to my building, they had already called, saying I got the job. It was the happiest moment of my life.Todd was inside, waiting to have dinner. When I told him, his face tightened. “You beat me,” he said.“What?”“You beat me,” he said, not warmly. “You got there first.”He then pivoted, hugging and congratulating me, but the damage was done. I hadn’t known we were still competing.We muddled through the holidays. At a raucous New Year’s Eve party, we kissed tentatively at midnight. “Can we leave?” he said. I wanted to stay, but we went home and lay next to each other in silence.I wanted him to be happier for me. I fell asleep formulating the conversation we would have about how hurt I was. I knew it could be sorted out.When I woke up, Todd was gone. On my phone was a voice mail message: “Andrew, I can’t do this. You are clearly on your way to someplace else, someplace without me. I’m happy for you, but that was my dream, too. I don’t think I can watch someone else do it before me. I’m sorry. I love you.”Related LinksTiny Love Stories: ‘She Moaned Longingly at My McFlurry’Feb. 19, 2019During a Night of Casual Sex, Urgent Messages Go UnansweredJuly 28, 2017Andrew Rannells: The First Time I Watched the Tony AwardsJune 5, 2018It was dark out.

5c99ea7649f0eacbf105f0d5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/books/review/siri-hustvedt-memories-of-the-future.html,"MEMORIES OF THE FUTURE By Siri HustvedtSiri Hustvedt is known, rightly, as a novelist of ideas, so it’s not surprising to come across a concept in her new novel, “Memories of the Future,” that’s so hard to wrap your mind around you could look it up and still not understand it, unless you happen to be particularly good at math. It’s Minkowski spacetime, a geometric model of special relativity that unites space and time in four dimensions (three of space, one of time). I should state for the record that spacetime comes up only once and is discussed for less than a page. But I would argue that it’s an important page.To back up: “Memories of the Future” is lightly fictionalized memoir or, in the term of the moment, autofiction. In it, Hustvedt tells two tales. The first is about SH, a 23-year-old Minnesotan of Norwegian extraction who comes to New York City in 1978 to try her hand at a novel. Note the initials: Hustvedt is also from Minnesota, also of Norwegian descent, also came to New York in 1978 and so on. It’s “a portrait of the artist as a young woman,” in Hustvedt’s words. The second is the story of how the first one came to be told. Almost 40 years later — that is, in 2016 — SH discovers a journal from 1978 that she thought she had lost. She and her sister are moving their 92-year-old mother from the independent-living wing of a retirement complex to the assisted-living wing, and there it is, a black-and-white Mead composition book entitled “My New Life” in a box of old stuff her mother had saved. “I greeted it as if it were a beloved relative I had given up for dead,” SH says. Inside lie fragments that allow her to resurrect her younger self: a diary whose entries often begin “Dear Page,” passages of the novel she’s trying to write, doodles and drawings. And off we go.The young SH is a charmer. If you came to New York in the late ’70s, as I did, to experience the beauty and terrors of the city in its ruins and its glory days, she will make you nostalgic. She certainly has that effect on the older SH. The young woman is the kind of enthusiast who hops on the creaky floorboards upon taking possession of a dank one-bedroom apartment in a dubious building. Freedom! Possibility! Also a neighbor who moans loudly at night, over and over again, what sounds like “amsah.”ImageYoung SH takes stabs at her novel, a mystery with the cheerful unreality of not-very-good young-adult fiction. She reads Wittgenstein and Bergson and roams the streets and rides the subway. The older SH makes wistful lists of the city’s now-vanished detritus: “faded signs, tattered awnings, peeling posters and filthy bricks” on the old Upper West Side, and the peep shows and “silhouettes of naked women with jutting breasts and long legs” in the old Times Square. There are bookstores: the Coliseum, Gotham Book Mart, Books and Company, the Eighth Street Bookshop.Eventually, the young SH makes friends, goes to poetry readings and clubs and becomes obsessed with figuring out what’s going on with her moaning neighbor. Pressing a stethoscope to the wall, SH eavesdrops and takes notes. “Amsah” turns out to be “I’m sad.” As the woman progresses from lamentation to self-argument in growls and higher-pitched replies to some sort of cultlike ritual, it becomes clear that the neighbor’s story is the stuff of a novel that the young SH is too inexperienced to realize is writing itself next door.But the neighbor is a MacGuffin, a distraction from what strikes me as the real substance of the book: the narrator’s ruminations on the nature of memory and time. After a while, I was finding it helpful to think of “Memories of the Future” as an essay rather than a novel. The best essays record the tacks and turns of an interesting mind, and Hustvedt — also an accomplished art critic and essayist — is never not interesting. Her acts of mind are more bracing than the story of SH, which feels thin and sepia-toned, like a photograph put through one of those antiquing apps.“I am interested in understanding how she and I are relatives,” the narrator says in one of her better digressions, and one answer she contemplates is: in Minkowski spacetime. I asked a physicist friend to help me visualize this, and he said, “Think of sliced bread.” “Imagine all of space at one moment of time is like a giant slice of bread (perhaps an infinitely large slice of bread),” he emailed. “A loaf of such slices, with a peculiar way of laying out distances, would be akin to Minkowski spacetime: Each slice represents space at one moment of time, and by putting all the slices together in temporal order, you get spacetime.” In other words, in spacetime what’s past is also present and future. Or, as Hustvedt puts it, “Over there in Minkowski spacetime, the still girlish ‘I’ and the much older ‘I’ coexist, and in that startling 4D reality, the two of us can theoretically find each other and shake hands or converse together.”This time-defying preservation of selves, this dream of plenitude without loss, is like a snow globe from heaven, a vision of Eden before the expulsion. Mathematically demonstrable but emotionally impossible, it’s dangled just in front of us like a bauble we can’t have but can’t stop reaching for. Except that Hustvedt finds a way to give it to us. I won’t tell you how, but I will say that the ending manages to be quite moving and unconvincing at the same time, a recapitulation of the tonal contradiction that pervades this sometimes incisive, sometimes sentimental novel, or memoir, or whatever we decide to call it."
5ca4767449f0eacbf1f80793,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/technology/personaltech/apple-airpods-review.html,"Apple’s new AirPods, those tiny wireless earbuds that look like Q-Tips dangling from your ears, are some of the coolest audio accessories you can buy today.Just insert the buds into your ears and they work instantly and seamlessly with your iPhone. When you are done using them, pop them into a white case that replenishes their power. They are sleek, innovative and convenient. I could go on, but this is where the gushing stops. That’s because AirPods have a finite life. That means you will probably have to buy new ones every few years, as if they were a good pair of shoes.Here’s how I know: After I bought Apple’s first-generation AirPods in late 2016, they became my favorite headset for taking phone calls and listening to podcasts. Their lack of wires made moving around easier, avoiding a mess of tangled cords. I haven’t once considered reverting to wired headphones.But about a month ago, my AirPods started dying. Their batteries, which are not replaceable by users, no longer last more than 30 minutes when I am on a phone call; they used to have enough juice for two hours of talk time. Other AirPod owners have recently shared similar complaints.The second-generation AirPods, which were released last week, may face a similar fate. That’s because their minimalist design involves embedding the batteries, circuit boards, microphones and antennas directly into the tiny earpieces. Then they are sealed up, making it impossible for us to open them to replace the batteries. There are some improvements. The new AirPods have slightly longer battery life and give you the ability to pick songs from an iPhone hands-free by speaking the command “Hey, Siri.” Yet this is a tough product to recommend for people who are slow to adopt new technology or who are environmentally conscious. While you can spend about $160 (or $200 for a version that includes a special case that can be charged wirelessly) for the new AirPods, you have to be prepared to shell out that amount again when their batteries inevitably wear out. Good wired earphones — which can cost less than $50 — last indefinitely, so long as you don’t rip the cords.So what’s right for you? Take a look below to decide.What’s new about the AirPodsThe new AirPods look virtually identical to the previous generation. The charging case resembles a white dental floss container. There are three batteries: one inside each earbud and one inside the case. When the charging case eventually runs out of juice, you can plug in Apple’s Lightning cable, the same wire used to charge iPhones.The $200 version of the AirPods includes a new case that can be charged wirelessly. That means you can place the case on a wireless charging pad, which uses an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, creating voltage that powers up the case. This method relieves the Lightning port of eventual wear and tear. The new case worked well with several wireless charging pads I tested. But because you will have to spend about $20 on a charging pad, I recommend buying the AirPods with the special case only if you already own other devices that support wireless charging, like newer iPhones. Like the first-generation AirPods, the new ones last about five hours when you listen to music. But for phone calls, they can now go about three hours, up from two hours previously. When you return the earbuds to the case, it has enough juice to recharge them multiple times; as a result, you will get about 24 hours of listening time before having to replenish the case. Over a week of testing, I recharged the case only once. The audio quality of the new earbuds is about the same as the first generation’s. Music sounds O.K. through them, good enough for playing podcasts and songs on your commute. But if you want wireless earphones that sound louder and richer with deeper bass, consider earbuds from Jabra or some of the other recommendations from Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times. The AirPods also include a new chip that lets people use them to interact with Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant. To summon the assistant, you say, “Hey, Siri,” followed by a command like “Play some music” or “Schedule meeting for 3 p.m. on Thursday.” While that’s a neat feature for tasks like adding items to your calendar, I couldn’t get in the habit of talking to Siri via AirPods — especially in public, where I still occasionally get dirty looks from people just for wearing the earbuds.ImageThe new AirPods look virtually identical to the last ones. They come in a charging case that resembles a white dental floss container.CreditCayce Clifford for The New York TimesApple’s battery programWhen the day the AirPods’ batteries are depleted eventually comes, you can take them to an Apple store and pay for battery servicing. The cost for battery servicing is $49 per earbud and $49 for the case, for a grand total of $147. At that point, you might as well buy a new pair.Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and offers guides for repairing electronics, has tried to pry open the new AirPods to see whether he could replace the batteries. He concluded that removing the batteries was impossible without destroying the gadget, which is a contraption of tiny circuit boards and ribbon cables soldered together.He added that Apple probably wasn’t capable of replacing AirPod batteries, either, when consumers take them in for servicing. That means people are most likely getting new AirPods in exchange for their old ones.“There’s no way Apple’s replacing batteries in these things,” Mr. Wiens said. “It can’t be done.”An Apple spokeswoman didn’t comment on whether the company was replacing batteries for AirPods or just giving people new ones. But one thing is certain: Maintaining AirPods isn’t easy compared with maintaining an iPhone, which you can take to Apple or a third-party repair shop to get a fresh battery or a new screen for relatively little cost. Do things have to be this way?Apple’s AirPods create a moral conundrum. Should you buy these earphones knowing that you will probably have to buy new ones every few years? In the process, you would essentially be using up energy, metals, plastics and human labor invested in creating the product.The AirPods reminded me of Tile, the company that offers Bluetooth trackers to help find items like house keys, luggage and wallets. In the past, the trackers were tightly sealed, making the batteries impractical to replace. When a Tile device was nearly a year old, the company would send an email warning that it would soon be time to “reTile,” or buy a new Tile. Using Tile thus felt more like a subscription service than ownership. After two years of this routine, I stopped buying Tiles.But the company recently made a big change: It started selling trackers with replaceable batteries. Simon Fleming-Wood, Tile’s chief experience officer, said that over time, the company had realized that the reTile process was angering people.“People didn’t realize that these Tiles died until they started hearing from us after 11 months that it was time to start replacing their Tiles,” he said. “When people realized that was part of the deal, some people had very negative reactions to that.”He added that the company was betting that by making the batteries easier to replace, customers would remain loyal to the brand.I hope Apple makes a similar change with AirPods. I asked the company whether the AirPods had to have irreplaceable batteries to achieve its design. Apple didn’t have an answer.The upshot: As someone who enjoys maintaining electronics for as long as possible before upgrading, I’m on the fence about springing for the latest AirPods. The fact that my first-generation ones have such shortened battery life after two years gives me pause about buying a new pair.But there are people who enthusiastically buy a new smartphone, tablet or computer as soon as they come out, year after year. The AirPods are perfect for them.Related Coverage How to Sell or Recycle Old ElectronicsDec. 2, 2015Choosing to Skip the Upgrade and Care for the Gadget You’ve GotApril 20, 2016How to Choose the Best Wireless HeadphonesOct. 3, 2017"
5ca67a4349f0eacbf1f80ff2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/smarter-living/tap-less-phone-voice-assistant-shortcuts.html,"When Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone in 2007, he dissed the tiny keyboards on rival smartphones. “They can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product,” he told the audience. “We’re gonna get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen.”That design decision eventually opened Pandora’s container ship: the teeming world of full-screen, touch-sensitive apps.Yes, eliminating the keys and buttons left a bigger canvas for displaying apps. But it also eliminated the keys and buttons. As a result, almost every smartphone task now requires tapping on glass. Typing text, correcting errors. Entering numbers, correcting errors. Changing settings, correcting errors.Over the years, Apple and Google have put enormous effort into reducing the tap tally for tedious tasks. With each software update, we get more features that streamline the steps.Unless you’re a hard-core geek, though, you may not have had time to keep up with them. Here are five ways to get things done more efficiently on your phone — to tap less and smile more.Set up self-expanding abbreviationsYou probably do a lot of repetitive typing on your tiny onscreen keyboard. You enter your contact information into one website after another. You reply to dozens of emails. You text stock phrases like “Got it — thanks” or “On my way!”Fortunately, you can set up short, quick-to-type text abbreviations (like ph) that type out much longer expressions (“Here’s my number: 212 718-2034”).To set up these shortcuts, begin like this:iPhone: Tap Settings, then General, Keyboard, Text Replacement.Android: Open Settings, then Language & Input. From here, the navigation depends on your phone model and Android version; you’re looking for Personal Dictionary. Getting there might involve tapping things like System, Advanced, Virtual Keyboard or Dictionary. (Some keyboards offer no text expansion at all.)In either case, when you tap +, you see boxes for both the phrase you want typed and the abbreviation (called Shortcut on the iPhone). Fill them in, tap Save and then try out your new tap-saving device in any app.You might set up addr to type out your street address, apm for “Airplane mode! See you when I touch down,” ily for “I love you” and so on. The best part: You never have to correct the typing.ImageBoth iOS (left) and Android let you create self-expanding abbreviations for common phrases.Give your voice assistant another shotYou’re forgiven if you’ve abandoned the dictation features of Siri or Google Assistant. Text-to-speech is still an imperfect technology.But the other function of these voice assistants — executing tasks — is far more reliable, and you’re probably not using it enough.Here’s your homework for the week: Adopt five new voice commands. Set your next alarm with “Wake me at 7:30 a.m.,” which saves seven taps. Avoid fumbling in the dark by saying “Turn on the flashlight” (two taps). Saying, “Text Casey that I’m running 15 minutes late” saves about 24 taps, and “What’s my next appointment?” saves a few more.It’s also worth learning to say, “Do not disturb” as you enter a movie theater, a meeting or your bed.Make a home screen bookmarkTo open a website, you usually tap to open your phone’s browser, tap for your list of bookmarks, then tap the bookmark you want. Or, worse, you painstakingly type in the web address.But you can also create bookmark “app” icons on your home screen that require only a single tap to open.To create one, open the web page. Then:iPhone: Tap the Share button (bottom center of the screen). Scroll the bottom row of icons until you can tap “Add to Home Screen.”Android: Tap the Menu button at the upper-right corner, which looks like three stacked dots. Tap “Add to Home screen.”ImageHere’s the process for turning any web page into an “app” icon on your Home screen, shown on iPhone (left) and Android.In either case, edit the icon’s name, if you like, and then tap Add. From now on, getting to your favorite site requires only a single sloppy tap.Squeeze for silenceWhen your phone rings at a bad moment — at a movie, for example, or in church — don’t extend the embarrassment by pulling it out and fumbling for the Ignore button.Instead, just reach into your pocket or purse and squeeze the phone. Pressing any button on the edge of the phone means “Silence the ringing, stop the shame” — and when you grasp the phone this way, you’ll hit one of those buttons in a hurry.Customize your controlsToday’s smartphones are almost ridiculously customizable. A typical iPhone’s Settings app contains over 11,000 options. (How do I know? While you were out having a life, I counted.)To avoid swimming through that sea of settings, you can summon a subset screen of Settings shortcuts. Swipe in from the bottom or top of the screen to see these important controls, like Brightness, Volume and Airplane Mode. On Android, swipe down from the top and you’ll get a similar selection, just above your notifications.But who says those are your most important controls? Maybe you, as an infrequent flier, have no use for Airplane Mode at all. Maybe you’d rather install a different button in its place.Fortunately, you can (and should) edit this panel, so that the settings you need often are there at your fingertips.iPhone: Tap Settings, Control Center, Customize Controls. In the list of options, the plus signs mean “add this button” and the minus signs mean “remove it.” Drag them (using the right-side handle) to reorder them.Android: Swipe down twice from the top of the screen and then tap the pencil button or the Edit button. On this screen, you can rearrange the Settings buttons by dragging. See the “Hold and drag to add tiles” area at the bottom? If you touch one of these extra buttons until the phone vibrates, you can then drag upward to install it onto the Quick Settings panel. Conversely, if you touch-until-vibrate on one of the currently installed buttons, a “Drag here to remove it” area appears at the bottom.It’s worth the effort. Every time you go hunting for a setting, you’re wasting time and taps.ImageOn both iPhone (left) and Android, you can customize the quick settings screen.Automate everything elseYou can save even more steps by setting up macros: multistep sequences you can trigger with a single command, even a spoken one. They can be as simple as “Take a picture!” to snap a photo hands-free, or as complex as “Let’s roll” to make the phone play a certain playlist, speak your arrival time at work and your first appointment, and get directions based on current traffic.The latest iPhone software version, iOS 12, comes with canned, ready-to-use macros — called Shortcuts — just for this purpose. Tap Settings, Siri & Search and then All Shortcuts to see them: “Get directions to [your home address],” for example, and “Record a new voice memo.”If you spot a shortcut that looks useful, tap it to record a spoken Siri command that triggers it.If you’re even slightly technically inclined, you can download Apple’s free Shortcuts app and construct your own shortcuts from scratch. These can be far more elaborate — and useful.I made one that texts my most recent photo to my wife when I say “Hey Siri, send that to Nicki.” I use it constantly, which I’m sure she appreciates.A sampling of other shortcuts you can build:“Hush now.” Turns on Do Not Disturb until you leave your current location. “Call in.” The phone checks your calendar for your next conference call and then dials the number automatically. “What’s happening?” Displays the headlines from the News app. “Back it out.” For Tesla owners only. The car turns on and carefully self-drives out of its parking place. It’s perfect when some idiot has boxed you in too tightly to open your door.Apple offers a complete user guide for the Shortcut app here and the web is full of suggestions and sources for even more amazing Shortcuts.Similar apps offer the same idea on Android phones, like AutomateIt (free) and Tasker ($3).Fewer taps, brighter futureEach of these tactics requires a small investment in setup and learning time. But in the long run, you’ll save time, eliminate glass-tapping and delay the inevitable loss of your fingerprints."

Yet we can never go back to before. What we can do is to find more balance between human and digital relationships. A number of scientific articles demonstrate that these ubiquitous and ever-available devices are now getting in the way of quality time with our children and our friends. Even tweens think so. And a very recent study suggests that just having the phone in the same room divides our attention.Maybe it is time to hide the iPhone in a cubbyhole, at least when we are having dinner or going to a meeting. This might allow us to preserve the best part of yesteryear without throwing out Siri with the bath water.Kathy Hirsh-PasekArdmore, Pa.The writer, a fellow in psychology at Temple University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a co-author of “Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children.”"
5c5c1dc33a125f5075c087a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/untogether-review.html,"As far as I can see, the main purpose of “Untogether” is to fetishize Jemima Kirke. Playing Andrea, a writer and barely clean heroin addict, Kirke is a Marilyn Monroe fantasy in vintage frocks and strawberry curls. Stripping, stretching, dancing and posing, she works the camera so assiduously that her latest sexual partner, Nick (Jamie Dornan), barely gets a look in.Not that Nick, an emotionally shuttered doctor with a successful memoir under his belt, would register any more forcefully were Andrea not perpetually wiggling between him and us. And he’s not alone in his lack of definition: there’s scarcely a behavior or line reading in this exasperating relationship drama that doesn’t feel like affectation. Fraudulence might be a plot point, but only the writer and director, Emma Forrest, knows why it has to permeate the entire movie.Trailer: ‘Untogether’CreditCreditVideo by Freestyle Digital MediaDefined by emotional damage in lieu of personalities, Andrea and her younger sister, Tara (played by Kirke’s real-life sister, Lola Kirke), bumble through separate romantic crises. While Andrea uses sex to coax love, Tara, an oversharing aesthetician, is pulling away from her middle-aged boyfriend (an underutilized Ben Mendelsohn) and toward a twinkling rabbi (Billy Crystal, if you can believe it). His civil rights-era stories and hip sermons (“Can Siri Google your soul?”) leave her breathless.Dreamily shot in Los Angeles by Autumn Durald Arkapaw, “Untogether” toys with themes of faith and self-knowledge. But in a movie where quips (“You look like velvet, but you’re Velcro”) too often substitute for conversation, insight is fleeting. Like its psychologically adrift characters, this debut feature comes fancily packaged; what’s inside, though, is mostly hot air."
5c3daf313a125f5075c04736,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/books/review/erica-feldmann-hausmagick.html,"How did I know my anxiety had gotten the better of me? When I found myself taking meticulous notes on a forthcoming book by Erica Feldmann called HAUSMAGICK: Transform Your Home With Witchcraft (HarperOne, $25.99, available in March). The year 2018 hadn’t been so great, what with the death of a husband and, possibly, a republic. Maybe 2019 would be better if I bought certain purifying elements for my home. The right crystals, sage sticks and — salt? Apparently, you can sprinkle salt around the house after a person with “toxic energy” visits. Attention future dates: If you see me reaching for the shaker as you’re leaving, you know things haven’t gone well.If my nerves are frayed, I take cold comfort in knowing I’m not alone. Whether it’s our political situation, the jangling distractions of everyday life or the not-irrational sense that mankind’s need to find another planet isn’t just a sci-fi plotline, we seem to be in the midst of one massive freakout. Kierkegaard argued that anxiety stemmed from the “dizziness of freedom,” the paralysis that comes from infinite choice and possibility. That was in 1844. Imagine what he would have thought about today.But here’s some good news: If we’re all a little tense, well, there’s a book for that. Many books, actually. Several of the ones I consulted were so wrongheaded or incomprehensible they made me more nervous. (“Motivation is a Unicorn Fart” almost made me hurl in a glittery rainbow arc.) Here are three that worked.Recently a friend told me that he had reached what he calls his vidpoint: the moment you realize you have more movie hours stored on your DVR than you have hours left to live. I thought about that friend while reading Matt Haig’s NOTES ON A NERVOUS PLANET (Penguin, paper, $16), a follow-up to his previous book “Reasons to Stay Alive,” which chronicled his struggles with anxiety and depression. The core of first-world malaise, he argues, can be summed up by something T. S. Eliot observed in “Four Quartets”: We are “distracted from distraction by distraction.” Here, in clever chapterettes and listicles (he seems to assume we’re all too jumpy to read more than a few pages at a time), Haig muses about our anxieties: our fears of aging, of not being rich, of not being beautiful or successful enough. All while being massive consumers of everything. What really sells, he says, is not so much sex as fear. Every day, every minute, we’re deluged with images of people who are prettier, richer and having more fun than we are. And then there’s the bombardment of news, which is presented in a way to provide “more food for our nightmares.” Which is why we must take time to simply turn it all off and go outside. (I’m going to do this just as soon as the Mueller report is delivered.) This isn’t exactly a novel concept, and Haig mentions but doesn’t explore the science of, say, why staring at the sky or simply being out in nature helps our mental health. But he does have some memorable ways of telling us about it. (“Hello. I am the beach. … I have been around for millions of years. I was around at the dawn of life itself. And I have to tell you something. … I am entirely indifferent to your body mass index. … I am oblivious.”) And he has one terrific piece of advice that I’m thinking of sewing on a pillow sampler and giving to my teenage sons: “Never be cool. Never try to be cool. Never worry what the cool people think. Head for the warm people. Life is warmth. You’ll be cool when you’re dead.”I can’t help noting, however, that the last time I checked Haig’s Twitter feed he had posted seven times in two hours. Maybe he’s still trying.“Anxiety” is a mild term for what can be a severe mental illness. In fact, anxiety disorders of various degrees are among the most common mental illnesses in America, affecting more than one in five adults. In HOW NOT TO FALL APART: Lessons Learned on the Road From Self-Harm to Self-Care (TarcherPerigee, paper, $16), Maggy Van Eijk starts with a hopeful message: You can have any number of mental health issues and still learn to cope. Van Eijk, who’s now the BBC’s social media editor, has a history of severe anxiety as well as borderline personality disorder; her arms are scarred from years of cutting. She’s also really funny. Here’s a partial list of what one of her bad anxiety days can look like: “Waking up in the middle of the night to remember that thing I said five years ago was a bit rude. Time to linger on that memory until sunrise! … Having a bath to try to relax but then remembering the bath is basically an open coffin filled with my own liquid filth. … Seeing a pile of clothes in the dark and thinking it looks like a massive panther, then thinking … ‘What if it is a panther?’”Van Eijk’s book is organized around life challenges, and what to remember if they happen to You, Person With Mental Illness. Her explanation of self-harm is particularly touching and helped me to understand why a person might do it. Among the reasons she hasn’t done it, she writes, is that “I’ve been listening to My Chemical Romance all day.” Rather, it’s about the anger that “refuses to leave my body” if she’s upset or about the feeling that “my voice isn’t being heard and it has nowhere to go.” This is a woman who, after a breakup, had to go to a burn unit after repeatedly putting out a cigarette on her arm, so one tends to listen to her about the distraction/substitution methods she uses to stop hurting herself. And her reasons for doing things as mundane as making lists turn out not to be mundane at all. “Lists,” she reminds us, “are a direct link to the future.” And if you’re someone who has thoughts about having no future, she says, they can at least temporarily steer you away from a terrible decision.If I had a self-destructive young adult in my life, someone in real pain, this is probably the book I’d get her.Like many who have experienced recent loss, I tend to bolt upright at 3 in the morning, heart pounding, with one overarching thought: “What now?”  Which is why I found Claire Bidwell Smith’s ANXIETY: The Missing Stage of Grief (Lifelong/Da Capo, $26) both soothing and informative. Smith was 14 and an only child when both of her parents got cancer. If that’s not enough of a breeding ground for a lifetime of anxiety attacks, I don’t know what is.The experience of both parents dying when she was young propelled Smith into hospice work and grief therapy. “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear,” C. S. Lewis wrote in “A Grief Observed,” and Smith understands this observation on the deepest personal level. She goes over techniques for dealing with anxiety, whatever its source. Maybe it’s about the guilt you feel when recalling the decisions you’ve made for a dying loved one; maybe it’s about your loneliness; or maybe, as is often the case in full-blown panic attacks, it’s because you’re convinced that you’re next. Smith’s words are particularly useful for panic attack sufferers. Once you know that you’re not, indeed, dying, she shows you how you can normalize your panic, and how you can look at these episodes with curiosity, not terror. It’s also useful to be reminded that American society isn’t one that honors grief. In many other cultures, she explains, quoting a colleague, you have “six or 12 months of a grieving period where the world doesn’t expect much of you.” Someone give me that one-year-free pass, please.Certainly reading a book or three may not be the answer, and none of these books emphasize, or even discuss, medication as a possible aid. My own thoughts about dealing with severe anxiety? Start with your doctor. And then, for life’s more modest challenges, there’s always my new go-to: A DRINKABLE FEAST: A Cocktail Companion to 1920s Paris (TarcherPerigee, $18), by Philip Greene. I have yet to try a Monkey Gland or a Scoff-Law cocktail, but am infinitely calmer after three glasses of vin blanc cassis — and pleased to know it was a Henry Miller favorite. Four ounces of chilled dry white wine, one ounce of chilled crème de cassis, red fruit for garnish. Now breathe.You’re welcome."
5ca2de9f49f0eacbf1f7ffcb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/books/lori-gottlieb-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone.html,"We are all familiar with the Epiphany. You know what it is: that moment in therapy when you finally realize exactly why it is you do whatever crazy thing you do. Chalk it up to the warm, loving therapist, plus your own innate genius. Right?Not so fast. “Insight is the booby prize of therapy,” Lori Gottlieb writes in her new book, “Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed.”“It’s great if you have it, but if you don’t take that insight and produce change, it’s worthless.”Gottlieb’s book is perhaps the first I’ve read that explains the therapeutic process in no-nonsense terms while simultaneously giving hope to therapy skeptics like me who think real change through talk is elusive.The book follows the lives of four very different people in crisis — well, five, if you count Gottlieb herself, whose life has been upended by a breakup with a man who was supposed to be her forever after.Gottlieb writes the “Dear Therapist” advice column for The Atlantic, and as a yarn spinner she shines; it’s not surprising that before she was a psychotherapist, she was a story development executive in Hollywood. (Eva Longoria has optioned “Maybe You Should Talk to Someone” for a television series.) But Gottlieb’s book is considerably more than an engaging series of case studies. It uses her patients’ crises, and her own, to ask some fundamental questions about what therapy is, and what it can and cannot do for us.This interview has been edited and condensed. What is a therapist’s main job?We hold up the mirror so that people can see themselves more clearly, but in a compassionate way. It’s not: “Look at you, shooting yourself in the foot again! What’s the matter with you?” It’s, “Hey, can you see that by doing such and such, here’s how you’re getting in your own way.” The therapy mirror isn’t the unflattering but distorted mirror we usually tend to look in, the one that makes us cringe; it’s a more objective reflection, with no judgment whatsoever. It’s a compassionate mirror.What is one thing that is not a therapist’s job?The Buddhists call it idiot compassion. It’s what we often do with friends and family — we’re afraid to hold up the mirror to them. We don’t want to upset them, so we tilt the mirror to their liking, telling them what they want to hear and not what they need to hear. But our compassion ends up being more harmful than our honesty would have been.ImageCreditSonny Figueroa/The New York TimesWise compassion is what therapists practice when we hold up the mirror and say, “Hey, take a look at your reflection for a second.” We show how much we care by being willing to deliver a compassionate truth bomb.When you talk about successful therapy, you quote the famed psychotherapist John Weakland: “Before successful therapy, it’s the same damn thing over and over. After successful therapy, it’s one damn thing after another.” Can you explain that a bit?I love that quote. As therapists, we help people see self-defeating patterns that are contributing to their struggles, and once they see why the same thing keeps happening over and over — the same fight with their spouse, the same difficulty with family or bosses at work, the same fear of not being good enough that contributes to repeated rejection — they realize that the reason their lives feel like “Groundhog Day” is because of something they’re doing that they can change or do differently.Changing these patterns transforms people’s lives. But what we can’t do for people is change the nature of life, which includes hardship. People will always encounter “one damn thing after another” that they can’t control, but they can change their response to it.I love your description of your own therapist, Wendell, who seems a throwback to another era: “His expression is intense but gentle, a combination of a wise elder and a stuffed animal.” And in fact you make a point about therapy itself, that it’s old-fashioned, kind of a throwback to a different time. What do you mean by that?Our world is moving at such a fast pace, and people who come to me often want things to move very quickly. It’s a very human impulse. Help me not to feel NOW, give me a pill. Which is great; I’m not anti-medication at all. There are people who benefit greatly. But there are also a lot of people for whom medication alone won’t work. People mistake feeling less for feeling better. Therapy teaches you otherwise.You have a tale in the book that is one of the biggest fears of every psychotherapy patient: being fired by your therapist because you’re a hopeless case.Yeah, I talk about a patient who was constantly saying I was not helping her. I could see exactly why people were pulling away. Everything and everyone disappointed her. The guys in her life were all commitment-phobes and the women were snobs, and the colleagues were blah blah blah — and I was so bored.O.K., I am pretty sure that fear of boring a therapist ensures I’ll never go.Well, I felt like such a failure, but I had trouble breaking up with her. Partly I was worried how she would feel, but it’s also my own ego. You keep thinking, If I can just find the key and unlock this. But sometimes you can’t. And the thing is, she came to me with the issue of having problems with relationships in all areas of her life.Image“Wise compassion is what therapists practice when we hold up the mirror and say, ‘Hey, take a look at your reflection for a second,” Lori Gottlieb said. “We show how much we care by being willing to deliver a compassionate truth bomb.”CreditMagdalena Wosinska for The New York TimesSometimes the dance you’re doing with your therapist is the dance you’re doing in the rest of the world.In the midst of your disastrous breakup, you also have some challenging but nonlethal health issues that you discuss — all while treating a patient who is actually dying.You can’t be a therapist and not be oriented toward a core. Without getting morbid, you do focus on mortality. You start thinking about the limited time you have on this planet, and how we generally don’t know how much time we have, and how that very thought drives us to find purpose. What will contribute to my growth, and what to other people’s growth?The experience of my patient, and my own, made me realize the importance of not wasting time. And one way we waste time — that hopefully therapy addresses — is the constant perseveration, the soundtrack in our heads that makes us mean to ourselves, and makes us make bad decisions. If we can start learning to be kind to ourselves, we save a lot of time on this planet.How do I ask this delicately? O.K., I can’t. This book is very revealing about you. Are you worried that your patients will know too much?(Laughs.) Well, it’s the most revealing and personal book I’ve written — by design. Patients and therapists are at cross-purposes, in a way. We want to help patients function better, but they often want to come across in a certain ideal way, and we want to see them in a more realistic way. And it was the same with me. I want to come across well, too. The first draft, I was nonprotective of myself, then, second draft, I tried to clean myself up. In the cleaning up, I deflavorized the entire story, I took the humanity out of it. My persona was polished. And it was not what being human looks like. It felt disingenuous, making people raw and real and polishing myself. So I stopped cleaning myself up. I feel the vulnerability of doing that, but I got more comfortable with it.Which raises a question that’s really at the heart of this book. It’s something we all think about, in and out of therapy: Can I be truthful and still be loved?Carl Jung called secrets “psychic poison,” which is apt, because secrets are corrosive and go hand in hand with shame. We have so much shame underlying the truth of who we are, and that’s also why in my book, it takes a while before I really hear my patients’ stories — or my therapist really hears mine. We’re so afraid of the truth that sometimes we even hide it from ourselves.So I think “Can I be truthful and still be loved?” is the paradox we all live with, both in the therapy room and in our personal relationships. So many people believe that the pretty version of themselves makes them more lovable, so they do everything they can to put that version out there. But what they discover in therapy is that the truth of who they are — warts and all — is what draws people to them. That’s the glue, because in that truth lies connection. I see you. You see me. That’s a delicious feeling."

People will be able to speak to Siri on their iPhones to play content they had purchased from iTunes on the Vizio TVs. Samsung, Sony and LG announced similar partnerships with Apple.In the past, AirPlay and iTunes videos were mostly tied to Apple-made hardware like the Apple TV set-top box. Their expansion to third parties underlines Apple’s ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services. That’s especially important now that sales of Apple’s cash cow, the iPhone, are slowing. This month, the company reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years.The move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by Apple to open its technology to other companies, including competitors like Samsung.In a statement provided by Samsung, Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet software and services, said that with the expansion of iTunes and AirPlay, “iPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home.”ImageInteracting with facial-recognition software.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesFront and center at CES was the battle between virtual assistants — namely Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant. Google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with Assistant, including smart watches, speakers and displays. The company said a billion devices now work with its assistant, up from 400 million last year. Google wants to make the Assistant the focal point of a consumer’s life: in the home, in the car and on mobile devices.“When I walk down the aisle at Home Depot, will all the devices I might buy work with the Assistant?” Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant, said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats. “The answer is yes.”Amazon also had a large presence at the show. It filled a large conference room at the Venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with Alexa, including an Audi car, a motorcycle helmet and a stereo system.The battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices. Many of the smart gadgets at CES worked with multiple virtual assistants. Aaron Emigh, chief executive of Brilliant, which makes smart home products that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together, not against one another, because the smart home was already too complex, with products like light switches, thermostats and cameras coming from different brands.“The more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home, the more important that it all works together,” he said.ImageAmazon's Alexa technology made its way into car dashboards.CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York TimesCar manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and 5G wireless connections. But consumers won’t be able to buy self-driving vehicles from a dealership anytime soon, in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars. Smarter cars with features like built-in voice assistants to help people use maps, play music or get a sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now, however.If the economy does cool off, sales of cutting-edge gadgets will drop. Fast. But that didn’t faze people here. None of the CES attendees I spoke to expressed concern.Matt Strauss, who oversees Comcast’s Xfinity internet and cable service, was especially bullish about the year ahead. He said just about everything announced at CES required an internet connection, so that’s the last thing that people would cut off. “It’s become like oxygen,” he said."
5cacbf4149f0eacbf1f81e03,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/09/us/ap-us-trapped-student-death.html,"CINCINNATI — A prominent civil rights attorney is the latest to seek answers into what happened a year ago when a Cincinnati teenager became trapped in his family's minivan near his school and died after making two heartrending appeals to 911 for rescue.Al Gerhardstein has in recent weeks made sweeping records requests to the city and police about the failed response April 10, 2018, to Kyle Plush's calls . The 16-year-old student eventually suffocated from having his chest compressed after he was apparently pinned by a foldaway rear seat when he reached for tennis gear while parked near his school.""We're investigating on behalf of the family,"" Gerhardstein said. ""That's all I can say.""He has asked for reports, recordings and other records on the 911 response. Much of that information has already been reported by The Associated Press and other news outlets, but the attorney is also trying to go deeply into any history of problems at the emergency center.The veteran Cincinnati attorney has a history of litigation against the city and police, and he represented lead plaintiff James Obergefell in the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage.The police department and city didn't respond to requests for comment about Gerhardstein's efforts.The possibility of a lawsuit is the latest development in the year since Plush's death. It led to multiple investigations and to improvements in the city's 911 system technology, staffing, training and police procedures.But the youth's parents, who started a foundation to push for nationwide reforms, have expressed dissatisfaction .Jill and Ron Plush took part repeatedly in city council meetings last year, pushing for reforms and accountability for their son's death. Using the voice-activated feature on his cellphone, he had Siri dial 911, warning: ""I'm going to die here."" He called again minutes later, this time describing his vehicle as a gold Honda Odyssey.Two police officers drove around at the boy's high school looking for him but left without getting out of their cruiser. Kyle's father found his body nearly six hours after his first 911 call. Police have blamed communication breakdowns.""I'm heartbroken,"" Police Chief Eliot Isaac told the city council late last year, adding that officers and dispatchers are ""heartbroken, as well, that they didn't get the help to this young man. But we can sit here and we can Monday morning quarterback this thing — but the reality is there were some failures and some breakdowns, and we have to be better.""There have also been questions raised about the safety of the 2004 Odyssey. Honda in 2017 recalled some 900,000 later-model Odysseys because of concerns about second-row seats tipping forward if not latched properly, but spokesman Chris Martin said there were no seat-related recalls of the 2004 model. Honda, he said, hasn't been given access to the Plush vehicle.""The bottom line is that we're still interested in inspecting the vehicle in order to learn more about what may have happened,"" Martin said in an email. ""This is the only instance of its type, and there is no pattern of similar incidents from which to draw any conclusions. Even if we could inspect, there's no guarantee that we could definitively say what happened.""Thus, this one may remain a tragic mystery,"" Martin said.Meanwhile, the Plush family has pledged to memorialize him by continuing to push for 911 reforms across the nation and supporting emergency communications employees through a foundation in Kyle's name.""He would have wanted us to make changes, and to overcome obstacles to make changes to save lives so that this doesn't happen again,"" Jill Plush said recently at the Hancock County 911 Center, among visits the family and foundation volunteers made to several Indianapolis area centers, according to the Greenfield Daily Reporter newspaper.___"
5cadb0fa49f0eacbf1f8242b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/technology/personaltech/photo-organizing-apps.html,"Do you ever find yourself scrolling madly through your phone’s camera roll, looking for that one fabulous vacation shot you’re describing to a friend — and you can’t find it in the river of 4,000 photos? Or do you want to collect all the pictures of a child, scattered through the years, for a slide show but don’t have time to find them?Herding pictures into sensible albums on the phone can be tedious if you bother at all, but here’s the good news: If you’ve been using the current versions of Google Photos on your Android or Apple device or Apple’s Photos for iOS, there’s a good chance that the apps have been organizing your images for you. It can be a little unnerving to see how these apps have analyzed your pictures. But the software can save you hours and is simple to use. Here are ways to use the programs — and how to tweak them to adjust to your needs.Method 1: Visit the Location-Based ‘Places’ AlbumImageOn the Albums tab in Google Photos, left, or Apple’s Photos app, right, tap the Places icon to see how the program has sorted your pictures based on the location information embedded in the file.If your phone’s location services setting was enabled when you took the pictures, the geographical coordinates were likely embedded into the image file; this is also called “geotagging.” Tap the Albums tab in Google Photos or Apple’s Photo app to see the Places album, with pictures labeled and grouped by location. Tap a thumbnail to see all the photos taken in that spot, regardless of the date.No GPS information in the photo file? You can add locations manually in the desktop editions of Google Photos and Apple’s Photos. Open the photo you want to tag, click the Info icon — which looks like an encircled “i” — and choose the option in the information box to edit or assign a location.ImageOne way to add or edit a picture’s location information: Open the image in Google Photos for the desktop web browser and click the Info icon to get to the “Edit location” setting. Apple’s Photos for Mac has similar controls. You can add location information to pictures imported from other cameras this way, too.If you’re not set to sync photos with the desktop via Google’s backup and sync option or Apple’s iCloud, you can import them from the phone. Third-party apps can also edit photo location data.Method 2: Browse the ‘People’ AlbumImageGoogle Photos, left, and Apple’s Photos app, right, automatically scan the faces, but you need to add or confirm names.Unless you’ve disabled the feature, Google Photos automatically groups similar faces in your photo library together with its facial recognition software. To see the groupings and label them, tap the Albums tab and go to People & Pets. Select a thumbnail to open the group and add a name. The pictures then show up when you search for that person by name in Google Photos.Photos for iOS also collects faces found in the picture library and displays them in the “People” area on the Albums screen. You can label each group with a name by tapping a photo and using the Add Name option. To add new people in Photos for iOS, open a photo of someone, swipe up to see a thumbnail of the person in the People area and tap to enter a name.ImageTo create an album based on all the pictures you have of a person in Apple’s iOS 12 Photos app, swipe up on a picture, tap the circular thumbnail and then add a name on the next screen.Both apps include settings to remove someone from the People album. Tap the three-dot Options menu in the top-right corner of a person’s album to get to the controls.Method 3: Use Keyword Search to Find PhotosImageIf you don’t feel like wading through albums, use the search box in Google Photos, left, or Apple’s Photos app, right, to look for pictures with specific things, places or people in them.Google’s and Apple’s picture programs both include a search box where you can type in keywords for people, places and things — or a year, month or date. If you have names in your People album and geotagged photos, use the app’s search box to round up results, like “Mary in Louisville in 2019.”Even without having to add or confirm photo tags yourself, you can also search for items within images, like “wedding dress” or “concerts,” thanks to basic object and scene recognition in both apps. Keywords like “mountains” and “ocean” also bring up corresponding outdoor shots. Tired of typing? Tell the Google Assistant or Apple’s Siri to find your tagged photos.Method 4: Wander the ‘Automagical’ GroupingsImageYou can also tap the Albums tab in Google Photos, left, or Apple’s Photos, right, to see the various types of images you’ve captured on your device, including videos, selfies and screenshots.The object-recognition function sorts your pictures into numerous general categories, even without your having to use the search function. On the Albums tab in Google Photos, tap the “Things” thumbnails at the top of the screen to see photos grouped under general headings like “Fireworks” and “Monuments.”ImageFor those who prefer to let software handle it, Google Photos, left, and Apple’s Photos app, right, include other organizing tools like the Google Assistant's self-updating albums and Apple's automatically generated collections of “Memories” from a day’s adventure.Need to quickly find other types of content in your library, like videos, animated GIFs or panoramic photos? Select the Albums tab in either app and scroll to see those file types already sorted. When you tap the Search tab, Apple’s Photos app reveals a “Categories” area. To find other groupings, tap the For You tab. Here, you can see collections including “Memories” of multiple-photo events like museum visits."
